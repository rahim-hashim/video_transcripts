Video Description: Trump is a master at wielding attention. He’s been owning news cycles and squatting in Americans’ minds for much of the last decade. And for his second term he has an ally in Elon Musk, a man with a similar uncanny skill set.
Trump and Musk seem to have figured out something about how attention works in our fragmented media age — and how to use it for political and cultural power — that Democrats simply haven’t. So what is it? What do they understand about attention that their opponents don’t?
Chris Hayes is the host of MSNBC’s “All In,” and has written a forthcoming book, “The Sirens' Call: How Attention Became the World's Most Endangered Resource.” And he’s a brilliant thinker on how our modern attention economy works and what it’s doing to our politics.
We discuss what Hayes sees as a revolution happening to our attention, which he compares to the Industrial Revolution in its scale and impact; why the old rules about attention in politics no longer apply; the key insight Trump had about attention that fueled his rise; why Musk didn’t really overpay for Twitter; and how Democrats can compete in this new attentional world.

# Democrats are Losing the War for Attention. Badly.  | The Ezra Klein Show
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE)
*  On Monday, Donald Trump is going to take the oath of office for the second time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=0.0s)]
*  During his first administration, there was a question of how he wields policy and government, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=6.04s)]
*  the question of how he wields and uses and raises money. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  We're used to talking about that with politicians. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=15.0s)]
*  But there was also the separate question of how he wields and uses attention. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=18.2s)]
*  And Trump, whatever else he is, he's a master at using and wielding attention. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=23.04s)]
*  Donald Trump has met the media moment. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=28.28s)]
*  Conflict is attention and attention is influence. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=30.8s)]
*  Donald Trump is a marketing genius. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=34.2s)]
*  He understands stagecraft. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=36.44s)]
*  He understands the power of the visual image. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=38.28s)]
*  In some ways, the defining feature of the last decade of public discourse has been [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump is the center of attention. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=44.88s)]
*  My friend Chris Hayes is best known as the host of MSNBC's 8pm show, All In. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  But he just wrote a great book called The Siren's Call, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=52.72s)]
*  How Attention Became the World's Most Endangered Resource. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=55.96s)]
*  I've read most of the books on attention out there. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=59.52s)]
*  This one is, I think, the best one at understanding the value of attention today. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=62.52s)]
*  Because it isn't just endangered. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=67.52s)]
*  It is the world's most valuable resource. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=69.68s)]
*  And the people who are on top of the world right now understand its value and understand [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=72.84s)]
*  how to wield it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=76.8s)]
*  And that's what this conversation is about. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=77.8s)]
*  It's a curtain raiser on the intentional regime we're about to enter. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=80.84s)]
*  As always, my email is reclineshow.nytimes.com. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=85.52s)]
*  Chris Hayes, welcome to the show. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=94.08s)]
*  It's really great to be here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=95.64s)]
*  So you've got a cable news show. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=96.88s)]
*  You're an attention merchant. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=98.56s)]
*  I am. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=100.16s)]
*  What is different about the way attention felt and worked in the early 2000s, when you [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=101.16s)]
*  were starting out, when I was starting out, and the way it feels and works for you now? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=106.36s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=111.72s)]
*  One is just there's more competition. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=112.72s)]
*  So much more competition. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=115.44s)]
*  The notion now that at every single moment, when you are competing for someone's attention, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=117.36s)]
*  you are competing against literally every piece of content ever produced. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=123.32s)]
*  I love this thing that happened a few years ago where suits, which was a network show [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=129.96s)]
*  that became the most watched show on Netflix. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=135.16s)]
*  And it's like, it never would have occurred to me back in 2013 that I might be fighting [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=138.16s)]
*  for eyeballs with someone watching suits. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=143.92s)]
*  At every single moment that you are trying to get someone's attention now, the totality [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=146.11999999999998s)]
*  of human content is the library of your competition. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=151.82s)]
*  And that was not true. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=156.42s)]
*  I think that was not true in 2000. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=158.0s)]
*  I mean, it was definitely not true in 2000. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=159.27999999999997s)]
*  It's weird going in a lifetime from the problem of too little content to too much. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  I remember being a kid and I would read the cereal box. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=167.72s)]
*  I would read anything around me. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=172.68s)]
*  And there was never enough. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=175.96s)]
*  There were all kinds of times in my life when I was caught without anything to read. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=176.96s)]
*  And now it never happens. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=182.72s)]
*  There's so many, so much of my life that would be better if I was caught without anything [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  to read. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  But in my pocket is this portal to, you know, what is pretty close to everything ever written. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  Pretty close. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  I remember a version of the Elias Sports Bureau's like sports baseball compendium of stats. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=198.2s)]
*  And I would sit, I just read, you know, who the top 40 ERA pitchers. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=205.76s)]
*  When I was a kid, I knew the manufacturer suggested retail price of every single car [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  on the road by year. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  Like I could tell you not just not just what a Camry cost, but what a 93. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  You must have had some book. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=226.56s)]
*  I had like the blue book. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=227.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=228.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=229.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=230.56s)]
*  And that and you would in some ways, right, the lack of choice forced to kind of focus. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=231.56s)]
*  And I think you and I, you know, we're roughly the same cohort. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=236.72s)]
*  I was at the sort of front end of like RSS Google readers and blogs and this idea that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=239.56s)]
*  you could synthesize an insane amount of information very quickly if you kind of curated it and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=245.88s)]
*  you created processes to feed it into you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=254.0s)]
*  And those processes have gotten much harder and they've been totally overwhelmed by the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=256.88s)]
*  evolution such that I now have a very hard time even figuring out what the funnel I'm [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=262.91999999999996s)]
*  trying to construct is. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=268.88s)]
*  So you're it is hard sometimes I think when you've lived through attention and information [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=270.4s)]
*  changing as much as we have to take the long view. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=276.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=278.76s)]
*  One thing I liked about your book a lot is it takes the long view. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=279.76s)]
*  And I would say the core argument is it what is happening to attention now is akin to what [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  happened to human labor in the Industrial Revolution. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=287.08000000000004s)]
*  Spin that out for me. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  So if you think about labor, right, labor long predates labor as a wage commodity in [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=292.82s)]
*  the Industrial Revolution. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=300.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=302.04s)]
*  Human beings did stuff with their effort and toil from the time that they essentially evolved. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=303.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=307.76s)]
*  Like if you're hunting, gathering, picking berries, that's work. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=308.76s)]
*  Labor evolved into an agrarian feudal systems and all kinds of different ways of small shopkeepers [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=312.68s)]
*  that did they did work recognizably. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=317.64s)]
*  But what happens in the Industrial Revolution is that that human effort gets embedded in [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  a set of institutions, legal institutions, market institutions that commodify it so that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  every hour of wage labor is equal to every other hour of wage labor and then sold on [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  a market for a price. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=338.52s)]
*  And that's an enormous transformation in the human experience. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=340.26s)]
*  This is a total transformation in all social relations, political relations, economic relations, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=343.06s)]
*  and also crucially, the subjective experience of being alive in the world. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=349.26s)]
*  I think something similar is happening with attention. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=354.26s)]
*  And it started a while ago, the same way that the Industrial Revolution actually starts [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=357.86s)]
*  sort of earlier than we think of it at its peak. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=362.34s)]
*  But we're reaching a crescendo where this thing, attention, which predates it being [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=364.74s)]
*  commodified, people always paid attention to stuff, is now this market commodity that's [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  extracted and sold. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=375.18s)]
*  But go deeper. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=376.70000000000005s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=377.70000000000005s)]
*  What makes attention priceable and tradable now differently than it was before? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=378.70000000000005s)]
*  Or is that not the ground of the analogy? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=385.66s)]
*  They go into the specifics of this. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=387.5s)]
*  So there's a prehistory here, which is that from the birth of what we would call recognizably [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=388.94s)]
*  modern media and the penny press and magazines are probably the first place that you would [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=393.90000000000003s)]
*  call it that, particularly Benjamin Day's New York Sun, which has the idea that you [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=399.06s)]
*  charge people a penny for a newspaper. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=403.62s)]
*  You lose money on each newspaper, but you sell the advertising, right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=405.46000000000004s)]
*  So the thing you're selling is the audience. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=408.82s)]
*  Modern media has had this model for a long time. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=411.46000000000004s)]
*  And basically it's all been selling attention, billboards, newspapers, magazines, radios, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=414.42s)]
*  TV. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=419.14s)]
*  There's a few things that make it a difference in kind now, I would say. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=420.14s)]
*  One is the sophistication of how minutely you could capture people's attention and how [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=423.78000000000003s)]
*  quickly and sophisticatedly you could bring it to market. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=429.06s)]
*  So you've now got these nanosecond auctions that are auctioning off your eyeballs in the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=432.18s)]
*  moment you're loading a web page or in the moment that Instagram Reels is going through. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=436.42s)]
*  So that's one change. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=440.7s)]
*  The other is just the ubiquity. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=442.34000000000003s)]
*  The TV can't travel with you. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=444.98s)]
*  Magazines can, but eventually read everything in the New Yorker and that's it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=447.42s)]
*  The birth of the smartphone produces a ubiquity of attention to be captured and sold that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=451.54s)]
*  just represents a kind of break. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=459.98s)]
*  It just wasn't like that before. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=462.5s)]
*  One of the things happening in this era, the reason I think people are so interested in [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=464.86s)]
*  books about attention, concern about attention, is that the supply of attention is being changed [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=469.14000000000004s)]
*  and transformed by this process. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=475.66s)]
*  It is being trained. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=478.70000000000005s)]
*  My attention has been trained to want more than it used to want, to be more despairing [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=480.54s)]
*  when it can't get it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=486.74s)]
*  But also, the internet in a way, with just a much higher level of sophistication, turned [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=488.66s)]
*  into a massive experimentation for what works attentionally. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=495.98s)]
*  It's just this endless gain of function bio lab for attention. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=502.42s)]
*  I really think of a lot of social media as gain of function research for takes. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=508.3s)]
*  If you tweak the take and tweak it and tweak it, at what point does it go viral? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=514.86s)]
*  At what point does it go too viral and it destroys your career? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=518.02s)]
*  If you'd escape the lab in a way. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=521.74s)]
*  But there's something about not just seeing attention as a commodity, but seeing it as [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=525.1s)]
*  something that is manipulable, shapeable, changeable, such that our collective attention [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=528.9399999999999s)]
*  as a resource is changing that feels important in this. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=533.98s)]
*  I agree. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=537.9s)]
*  And I think when you had Graham Burnett on the show, who's great on this, attention researcher, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=538.9s)]
*  he talks about fracking. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=543.86s)]
*  And the point of the metaphor fracking is that you need more supply. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=545.9s)]
*  So there used to be a certain category of oil you could get. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=551.26s)]
*  And then market demand said you had to go get more of it and they figured out a way. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=554.66s)]
*  And there is something very similar happening obviously here. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=559.34s)]
*  The expanded supply. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=562.78s)]
*  So like eating into your sleep hours, that's more supply. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=564.34s)]
*  Getting children, that's more supply. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=568.94s)]
*  Looking at two or three things at once, which would have seemed totally like anti-social [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=571.38s)]
*  and borderline deranged two or three years ago, five years ago, ten years ago. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=575.58s)]
*  Watching a movie while staring at another screen. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=580.5s)]
*  Like if someone did that ten years ago, you would have been like, what are you? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=583.38s)]
*  It would be so weird. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=586.74s)]
*  The qualitative or subjective experience of what attention is, is shifting. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=588.82s)]
*  You talk in the book about attention now being the most valuable commodity, the most important [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=593.86s)]
*  commodity, the commodity that so many of the great modern businesses, among other things, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=598.58s)]
*  are built on like Google and Meta. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=603.98s)]
*  And I still think we're realizing it was undervalued or maybe that its most important value isn't [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=606.1400000000001s)]
*  selling it off to advertisers. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=614.1400000000001s)]
*  So I've been thinking a lot about Elon Musk, who emerges in your book as a slightly pathetic [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=615.9s)]
*  figure, right? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=620.38s)]
*  Trying to... [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=621.38s)]
*  Yes, the book was written before I think he kind of got a second chapter. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=622.38s)]
*  Yeah, trying to figure, fill this howling void he has for attention. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=624.9399999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk overpaid for Twitter at $44 billion. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=629.42s)]
*  It is not a business, as he has said himself, worth $44 billion. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=633.54s)]
*  On the other hand, the amount of attention that he is capable of controlling and amassing [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=638.1s)]
*  and manipulating through Twitter cannot be traded directly for $44 billion, but is clearly [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=645.5s)]
*  worth I think more than $44 billion. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=652.14s)]
*  Multiples of it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=654.94s)]
*  So how do you think about this translation that we're seeing happen right now between [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=656.5s)]
*  attention is like a financial commodity and attention is having more worth, frankly, than [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=661.6600000000001s)]
*  the money it would fetch on the open market? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=668.98s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=672.6600000000001s)]
*  I think he backed into the purchase of Twitter based on a kind of howling personal void. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=673.74s)]
*  But in the same way that Donald Trump backed into the same insight born of his personality [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=679.42s)]
*  and his upbringing in New York tabloid world, he figured something out that has been obviously [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=683.66s)]
*  tremendously valuable in dollar terms. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=690.74s)]
*  One of the really important ironies here, which I think does map onto labor, is that [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=694.52s)]
*  the aggregate of attention, like lots of attention, or the collective public attention is wildly [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=701.9399999999999s)]
*  valuable, right? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=706.86s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky is a great example of this, the president of Ukraine. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=708.54s)]
*  He understands that attention on Ukraine's plight is essentially the engine for securing [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=711.5799999999999s)]
*  the weaponry and resources his country needs to defend itself. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=718.22s)]
*  And yet, even though the aggregate of attention is very valuable, in market terms, each one [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=721.66s)]
*  of our individual attention to second to second is like pennies, fractions. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=727.14s)]
*  Not even pennies, fractions of pennies. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=731.9s)]
*  And that was exactly what it was like with labor. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=734.14s)]
*  When Marxists would say labor is a source of all value, they were right. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=737.74s)]
*  In the aggregate, take away all the workers and the industrial revolution doesn't happen. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=740.5s)]
*  But to the individual worker in the sweatshop, the little slice of labor that you're producing [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=745.1s)]
*  is both everything you have as a person and worth nothing in the market. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=751.22s)]
*  Almost nothing. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=756.1800000000001s)]
*  I think we have the same thing with attention, where it's like, it's really valuable, pooled [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=757.18s)]
*  and aggregated, like the most valuable. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=761.8599999999999s)]
*  Each individual part of it that we contribute is essentially worthless, is pennies. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=766.42s)]
*  And then subjectively to us, it's all we have. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=772.9s)]
*  I think attention is now to politics what people think money is to politics. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=775.78s)]
*  I totally agree with that. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=780.42s)]
*  Certainly at the high levels, right? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=781.42s)]
*  There are places where money is very powerful, but it's usually where people are not looking. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=782.42s)]
*  Money is very powerful when there's not much attention. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=786.38s)]
*  But Donald Trump doesn't control Republican primaries with money, controls them with attention. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=789.5s)]
*  And I keep having to write about Musk and I keep saying he's the richest man in the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=794.3000000000001s)]
*  world, but it's actually not what matters about him right now. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=797.38s)]
*  It's just how he managed to get the attention and become the character and the wielder of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=801.02s)]
*  all this attention. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=805.94s)]
*  And that's a changeover. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=807.34s)]
*  I think Trumpist Republicans have made and Democrats haven't. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=809.22s)]
*  Democrats are still thinking about money as a fundamental substance of politics. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=814.34s)]
*  And the Trump Republican Party thinks about attention as a fundamental substance of politics. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=818.62s)]
*  I really like this theory. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=823.1s)]
*  I think you're totally right to identify that it's sort of a sliding scale between the two, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=824.26s)]
*  which is to say politics that had the least attention, money matters the most. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=828.9s)]
*  So in a state rep race, money really matters, a state rep race, partly because no one's [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=834.62s)]
*  paying attention to who the state rep is. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=839.22s)]
*  Local media has been guided. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=841.5400000000001s)]
*  Because money can buy their attention. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=842.5400000000001s)]
*  So you could put out glossy mailers. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=843.74s)]
*  There's a lot you can do that, you know, the further up you go from that to Senate to president, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=845.78s)]
*  the more attention there is already, the less the money counts. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=852.0999999999999s)]
*  And you saw this with the Harris campaign. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=855.14s)]
*  They raised a ton of money and they spent it the way that most campaigns spend it, which [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=858.4599999999999s)]
*  is on trying to get people's attention, whether that's through advertising or door knocking, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=862.18s)]
*  right, but largely attention and then persuasion. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=866.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=868.74s)]
*  I'm running for president. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=869.74s)]
*  Here's what I want to do. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=870.74s)]
*  Here's why you should vote for me. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=871.74s)]
*  Now you can do that at billions of dollars worth. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=872.96s)]
*  And everything is just like drops of rain in a river because there is so much competition [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=877.2800000000001s)]
*  for attention. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=884.64s)]
*  And so what they what they figured out, I think, was that they being Harris or they [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=885.64s)]
*  being Trump, they being Trump and I think Musk is that what matters is the total attentional [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=890.4000000000001s)]
*  atmosphere. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=896.12s)]
*  That in some ways, it's kind of a sucker's game to try to like pop in and be like, I [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=897.12s)]
*  got mad. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=901.2s)]
*  Hey, do you like tax cuts? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=902.44s)]
*  You like what do you like? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=903.44s)]
*  Like all that's just going to whiz past people. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=904.96s)]
*  That the sort of attentional atmosphere, that's where the fight is. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=908.44s)]
*  And that's what Musk's quitter purchase ended up being an enormous, almost like Archimedean [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=914.36s)]
*  lever on the electorate. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=920.32s)]
*  I think this is right. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=922.32s)]
*  I think there's another distinction between Democrats and Republicans here, which is that [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=924.36s)]
*  I think Democrats still believe that the type of attention you get is the most important [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=928.8399999999999s)]
*  thing. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=934.7199999999999s)]
*  If your choice is between a lot of negative attention and no attention, go for no attention. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=935.7199999999999s)]
*  And at least the Trump side of the Republican Party believes that the volume, the sum total [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=941.56s)]
*  of attention is the most important thing. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=945.88s)]
*  And a lot of negative attention, not only fine, maybe great, right? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=947.3199999999999s)]
*  Because there's so much attentional energy and conflict. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=951.88s)]
*  So you'd really see this like Kamala Harris. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=955.68s)]
*  And once he became part of the ticket, Tim Walz and behind them, Joe Biden, you know, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=957.96s)]
*  before the changeover, they were just terrified of an interview going badly. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=961.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=965.76s)]
*  Trump and Vance and I mean, they were all over the place, including in places very hostile [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=966.76s)]
*  to them. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=970.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=971.28s)]
*  And Vance had a ton of interviews that went badly. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=972.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=973.28s)]
*  But they were everywhere because they cared about the volume of attention and were completely [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=974.28s)]
*  fine with the energy that negative attention could unlock. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=977.8s)]
*  I think this is the key insight, the key transformational insight of Donald Trump to politics. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=983.4s)]
*  So generally in politics, you want to get people's attention for the project of persuading [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=989.32s)]
*  them. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=993.96s)]
*  Friends, Roman countrymen, lend me your ears, Mark Anthony says, before he proceeds to attempt [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=994.96s)]
*  to persuade them. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=999.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1000.6s)]
*  What Trump figured out is that in the attention age, in this sort of war of all against all, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1001.6s)]
*  actually just getting attention matters more than whatever comes after it. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1006.6s)]
*  And one way reliably to get people's attention is negative attention. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1012.24s)]
*  Like if you insult people, act outrageously, I mean, this is literally there was a commercial [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1018.28s)]
*  model for this, which is shock jocks of the 1980s and 90s that we grew up with. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1023.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1026.8s)]
*  Like they were in a competitive attentional marketplace in local places. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1027.8s)]
*  Shock jocks said outrageous things. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1030.76s)]
*  They weren't trying to get someone to vote for them. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1032.46s)]
*  They just wanted you to know that they were on the running the morning zoo. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1034.0s)]
*  I don't know how to insert into the discourse a strong enough point that Joe Rogan is much [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1037.64s)]
*  better than Howard Stern was. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1045.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes, it's true. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1047.0400000000002s)]
*  Like nobody quite wants to admit this because now Howard Stern has become this lovable uncle [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1048.72s)]
*  who, you know, for liberals who has Hillary Clinton on his show and I think Kamala Harris [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1052.6000000000001s)]
*  went on his show. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1056.76s)]
*  But I think Rogan is the inheritor of Stern, basically. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1058.0800000000002s)]
*  Rogan has become much more right-wing in the past couple of years. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  But compared to what Stern was, Rogan is just smarter and preferable. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1067.56s)]
*  I think that's probably true. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1072.6s)]
*  But what I find crazy is the shock jock model has now become a successful model in politics. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1073.9399999999998s)]
*  Okay, but now I think we need to have like a moment of caution because there's a tendency [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1077.9199999999998s)]
*  right now because Donald Trump won the popular vote by like 1.5 percentage points, which [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1083.6799999999998s)]
*  is a terrible win. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1088.72s)]
*  Like the apples of American politics, right? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1091.44s)]
*  And yet there's just like no doubt that Trump and his broad cultural side have won some [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1094.3600000000001s)]
*  kind of cultural and intentional victory that is much bigger in its feeling than the actual [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1102.16s)]
*  electoral victory they won. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1108.6000000000001s)]
*  So some of these things both feel true. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1110.1200000000001s)]
*  Like I'm not sure this works as well in politics, but in terms of changing the culture, like [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  his win has changed the culture immediately in a way that I would not have foreseen and [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1115.8s)]
*  does not reflect. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1121.84s)]
*  Like if you just told some of the election results, I don't think they would feel the [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1122.84s)]
*  vibe shift. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1126.36s)]
*  So I agree with that. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1127.48s)]
*  And I want to sort of take those in two parts because I think the politics is actually worth [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1128.84s)]
*  taking a second with. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1132.32s)]
*  Mark Robinson ran for governor of North Carolina. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1134.32s)]
*  He was already elected as statewide as a lieutenant governor, said lots of outrageous things all [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1137.28s)]
*  the time. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1141.76s)]
*  He was discovered to be almost certainly, I think he denies it, but it seems to be pretty [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1144.0s)]
*  plausible. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1148.8s)]
*  A commenter on the nude Africa site where he said all sorts of wildly offensive things, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1149.8s)]
*  including I am a black Nazi. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1154.88s)]
*  Robinson lost that race in North Carolina, a state Trump carried. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1157.36s)]
*  It's probably like a plus one or two Republican state at national level. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1160.56s)]
*  It didn't work for him. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1165.16s)]
*  Like there was a lot of attention market. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1166.76s)]
*  Kerry Lake courted negative attention, lost two successive statewide races. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1168.76s)]
*  Doug Mastriano. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1173.8799999999999s)]
*  I could go down the list. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  So there's something really fascinating. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1176.32s)]
*  JD Vance underperformed in Ohio in his sentence. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1177.32s)]
*  Considerably. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1180.12s)]
*  So there is something happening where it's not a great, it has not proven to be a replicable [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1181.12s)]
*  strategy that the old logic that we were just talking about the Democrats having and being [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1186.8s)]
*  outdated still does hold in a lot of races. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1191.48s)]
*  That said, in terms of influence, I think negative attention is incredibly effective. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1195.3999999999999s)]
*  And I think you're seeing this shock, shock. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1201.8s)]
*  You can call it shock, shock. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1203.48s)]
*  You can just call it trolling politics. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1204.48s)]
*  I mean, it is trolling politics. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1205.48s)]
*  The idea of trolling and the reason that trolling exists is it's easier to get negative attention [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1206.9199999999998s)]
*  than positive attention. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1213.76s)]
*  It creates a conundrum for the other side, which is, do you ignore them while they say [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1215.44s)]
*  horrible stuff or do you engage them and give them what they want? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1222.56s)]
*  And I think this kind of trolling politics, which was really Donald Trump's insight, is [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1226.52s)]
*  the most transformational part of politics now. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1231.76s)]
*  And you're 100% correct. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1234.72s)]
*  The media management around Democrats is so much risk aversion. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1236.84s)]
*  If the choice is negative attention or no attention, we take no attention every time. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1243.08s)]
*  And that is the wrong choice. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1248.28s)]
*  You can frame this as a strategy. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1251.18s)]
*  And clearly people who are not temperamentally suited to the strategy, like Vance and Rubio [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1253.24s)]
*  and others have tried it on with varying degrees of fit at different times. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1258.76s)]
*  But I think it's better to frame it in a way as a temperament. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1264.12s)]
*  I mean, you write in the book, compliments roll off your back. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1266.12s)]
*  Criticism stays with you for days. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1270.6399999999999s)]
*  But it's not true for everybody, right? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1273.4199999999998s)]
*  There's a certain personality type that is okay with that negative charge. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1275.24s)]
*  It is okay being hated by many to be loved by some. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1282.12s)]
*  A lot of people would not have been willing to absorb the personal polarization Musk has [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1286.1200000000001s)]
*  decided to absorb to become as significant as he is. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1291.5200000000002s)]
*  Trump is very similar, right? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1295.0s)]
*  I think most people take the trait of being thought fairly well of by a larger number [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1296.2s)]
*  of people, even if not thought that much of by them in general, rather than absolutely [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1302.2s)]
*  hated by half the country to be quite loved by the other half in order to really dominate [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1308.2s)]
*  the attentional sphere. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1313.3000000000002s)]
*  And I think that's something in people. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1315.18s)]
*  And I guess what I'm asking you is, does politics now and attention suck for a kind of attentional [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1316.74s)]
*  sociopath? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1322.14s)]
*  I think it does. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1323.14s)]
*  I mean, I think it does select for potential sociopath. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1324.14s)]
*  I would push back a little bit in this respect, though. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1327.22s)]
*  I don't know how much of the negative feedback gets to Donald Trump and Musk. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1330.8200000000002s)]
*  Like I do think they have probably created... [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1335.14s)]
*  But he's sitting there watching MSNBC and getting mad at it or CNN. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1337.66s)]
*  He's the guy who actually seeks out stuff to make him angry. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1342.8200000000002s)]
*  But I guess what I'm trying to say is, I think it bothers him and Musk too. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1346.38s)]
*  I guess I just don't buy that it rolls off their back. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1352.18s)]
*  They're kind of obsessed with it also. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1355.46s)]
*  So that fixation manifests differently. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1358.6200000000001s)]
*  It at least doesn't turn them back. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1361.7s)]
*  They don't recede from the... [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1363.22s)]
*  The idea that they're sort of zen-like, like, well, you know, people are just going to hate [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1365.26s)]
*  him, like, that's not what's going on, psychologically. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1368.18s)]
*  So yes, I do, I worry actually that it now selects for a kind of sociopathic disposition. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1371.98s)]
*  Or just a very, like, broken and compulsive one. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1378.5s)]
*  Because like, I know just speaking for myself, like, you know, I have the show-off demon [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1383.46s)]
*  in myself and I've, from the time I was very young, wanted people to pay attention to me. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1388.82s)]
*  I don't love that part of me. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1393.66s)]
*  I don't think that's like the best part of me. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1395.66s)]
*  I think that my relationship to it is a little fraught and intentionally managed. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1397.9399999999998s)]
*  And I don't think that, like, I would be a better person if I let that beast run loose. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1405.6999999999998s)]
*  And I worry that the incentives are to basically do that, both for everyone individually, in [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1413.1999999999998s)]
*  politics and culture everywhere, and also in the kind of collective public sphere. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1420.1399999999999s)]
*  Let me say the thing that I think is the deepest problem here. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1426.74s)]
*  I think fundamentally the most competitive, attentional regimes select for the parts of [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1432.02s)]
*  people that are in the aggregate and over time, kind of the most reactionary. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1437.74s)]
*  That's the deeper problem I worry about. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1446.06s)]
*  Tabloid coverage of crime. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1450.54s)]
*  Tabloid coverage of crime, which literally goes back to Benjamin Day's New York Sun. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1454.1s)]
*  He was the first New York newspaper to have a court reporter who went to the court and [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1459.1s)]
*  said, wrote down what he heard, right? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1462.82s)]
*  Tabloid coverage of crime, 100%, has an ideological valence that is conservative, reactionary. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1466.02s)]
*  So I think generally competitive attention markets select for negativity. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1474.6599999999999s)]
*  They select for all kinds of things that generally lead people towards their sort of most reactionary [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1478.1799999999998s)]
*  selves. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1483.9s)]
*  And then the negativity bias of competitive attentional markets also means it's really [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1485.16s)]
*  hard for incumbents. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1491.18s)]
*  We've been, I think, talking about attention mostly in terms of social media here. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1492.94s)]
*  And I want to talk about another way that attention is in the way we think about stories [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1497.5800000000002s)]
*  like change in this period, which is reality television, which is the other side of this [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1502.14s)]
*  that Trump comes out of. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1507.3000000000002s)]
*  I understand Trump is sort of made by Twitter at that time, cable news at that time, and [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1508.3799999999999s)]
*  reality television. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1515.26s)]
*  Joe Rogan weirdly also comes out of reality television. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1517.26s)]
*  But one thing that has felt true to me about Trump's second term, much more than the first, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1520.84s)]
*  is it feels like reality television. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1525.02s)]
*  It is all these secondary characters with their own subplots and their own arcs and [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1527.58s)]
*  what's going to happen with Pete Hegseth and over here is R.F.K. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1532.54s)]
*  Jr. and Musk. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1535.3799999999999s)]
*  Trump is playing much more than he did in the first. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1537.18s)]
*  In the first term, Trump was the only character of the Trump administration. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1539.46s)]
*  Now he's playing a role that feels to me much more like the host. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1544.14s)]
*  Sometimes he comes out and somebody actually is voted off the island. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1547.18s)]
*  It's like, well, Matt Gaetz is gone now. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1550.5800000000002s)]
*  Or so and so is gone. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1552.78s)]
*  People get fired. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1553.78s)]
*  Or he settles the big plot of that week. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1554.94s)]
*  He's going to side with Musk and Ramoswami on H1D visas. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1557.46s)]
*  Or he comes in to announce a new plot like Greenland. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1561.66s)]
*  This week we're running a new competition. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1566.22s)]
*  He's not the only figure. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1569.14s)]
*  He's the host, the decider, the something. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1571.26s)]
*  Compared to other administrations, even compared to his first, this one is feeling programmed [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1576.74s)]
*  in a very different way. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1581.7800000000002s)]
*  I mean, you're somebody who obviously has to follow the plots and report on them night [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1583.7s)]
*  after night in the eternal purgatory that you are in. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1587.98s)]
*  There are worse fates. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1594.02s)]
*  Does that resonate for you? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1595.34s)]
*  It does resonate. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1596.54s)]
*  I mean, yeah, if you've ever talked to people in reality television, they selected for people [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1597.54s)]
*  with very flawed personalities, borderline personality disorder, narcissism, because [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1601.3s)]
*  that produced conflict and conflict produced drama. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1606.02s)]
*  Conflict is what keeps attention. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1609.78s)]
*  And those people like attention. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1610.78s)]
*  Not all of them, but the ones they pick. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1612.1399999999999s)]
*  You pick people on reality shows who like attention and are willing to absorb negative [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1614.42s)]
*  attention to be the star. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1617.54s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1619.06s)]
*  And you don't pick people who are just sort of shy and go along to get along. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1620.18s)]
*  What does that get you? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1624.3799999999999s)]
*  So that model, I think, explains a lot about the personalities that are selected for in [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1625.3799999999999s)]
*  context of intense attentional competition. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1634.58s)]
*  In terms of the programming, I totally agree, although I do think it's totally instinctual [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1637.54s)]
*  for him. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1642.7s)]
*  I don't think it's that plotted out. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1643.7s)]
*  But I do think fundamentally he thinks that you need to keep the attention. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1645.86s)]
*  He needs the attention at all times. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1651.22s)]
*  And he just has an intuitive sense of that. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1654.06s)]
*  The Greenland thing is a perfect example. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1656.9s)]
*  And there's been a thousand of them in the first Trump administration. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1658.94s)]
*  There'll be a thousand more, which is like, what do you do with it? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1661.18s)]
*  Is it attention getting to be like the incoming president wants to take over Greenland? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1666.3s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1669.98s)]
*  Is he serious? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1672.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1673.8600000000001s)]
*  Is it a good idea? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1674.8600000000001s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1675.8600000000001s)]
*  Should we debate it? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1676.8600000000001s)]
*  Should we talk about? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1677.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1678.8600000000001s)]
*  But we're all just now inside the attentional vortex of the Greenland conversation. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1680.62s)]
*  And he's done that again and again and again. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1686.06s)]
*  But it's a way in which his sense of it seems to have changed. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1687.78s)]
*  It was a well-remarked on and reported dynamic of the appointments in the first term that [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1690.78s)]
*  he had a casting orientation to them, but it was visual. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1698.6599999999999s)]
*  He wanted people who looked like a secretary of state, a general, a Federal Reserve chair. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1702.4599999999998s)]
*  So you got people like Brex Tillerson and Jay Powell in Trump 1. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1708.9s)]
*  He is building characters and selecting people who are good at going on podcasts, for instance, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1713.98s)]
*  or being on TV in Trump 2. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1719.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1721.58s)]
*  I mean, that latter point, I think he is selecting for people that will keep attention and communicate [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1722.58s)]
*  for sure. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1727.98s)]
*  I mean, I still think there's a certain amount of casting look to it with all of, we should [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1728.98s)]
*  like all of the biases that come with that. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1734.6200000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1737.9s)]
*  Like, if you're looking for a general on central casting, you're looking for a white man, right? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1738.9s)]
*  Which is part of, I think. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1743.06s)]
*  Yeah, but you're not looking for Pete Hegseth. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1744.38s)]
*  I guess, although I also think there's a certain amount of like, who does he see up on the TV? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1747.26s)]
*  No, I think there's that. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1751.82s)]
*  But I mean, it's a different story, right? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1752.82s)]
*  I mean, Pete Hegseth is a different kind of character. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1754.98s)]
*  I mean, he's an underdog in the thing. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1757.46s)]
*  Then Jim Mattis, for sure. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1759.1000000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1760.62s)]
*  He's, you know, it's more the sort of like a soldier who's going to take over and disrupt [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1761.62s)]
*  the thing. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1765.14s)]
*  Look, I'm not saying it's all planned out. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1766.14s)]
*  I'm just saying that there has been a way this feels different. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1768.34s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1772.1s)]
*  I mean, I also think, I think there's also an Occam's razor. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1773.1s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1777.1s)]
*  I also think the man is the oldest man ever to be elected to be president of the United [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1779.22s)]
*  States and like, maybe doesn't want to spend as much time doing everything. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1782.18s)]
*  Kind of, you know, if someone says in this season, we're going to let you like last season [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1788.1000000000001s)]
*  of the show, you had really long shooting days this season. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1792.74s)]
*  We're going to front some other characters. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1796.54s)]
*  So like, we can cut your shooting days in half. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1797.9s)]
*  Like I think there's a little bit of that happening now. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1800.42s)]
*  I want to ask about the Democrats in relationship to this. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1802.66s)]
*  And I guess one way to do it is it since the election, I mean, any room with six Democrats [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1806.78s)]
*  is a postmortem now, whether so formally or informally. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1812.38s)]
*  Personally, my favorite. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1815.6200000000001s)]
*  I'd like to keep this going for years. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1817.5s)]
*  There are parts of the postmortem that are divisive in the party, right? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1820.94s)]
*  Did they move too far left or actually did they moderate too much? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1825.06s)]
*  And what about Gaza? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1828.42s)]
*  And the one that every room of this I'm in, everybody agrees on is, and it's always said [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1829.42s)]
*  the same way, is that Democrats have a media problem. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1834.82s)]
*  I'm curious what you think that means. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1838.14s)]
*  Well, I think there's two components to that. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1841.14s)]
*  One I think you cannot avoid is that whatever you think about Joe Biden's abilities to be [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1843.78s)]
*  president in the sense of doing the job day to day, he was very clearly and I think irrefutably [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1847.9s)]
*  incapable of occupying the bully pulpit. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1855.22s)]
*  Like I just don't think there's any debate or argument on either side. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1858.42s)]
*  Like empirically, he gave fewer interviews. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1863.14s)]
*  He gave fewer press conferences. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1865.3s)]
*  He I mean, compare, go watch Barack Obama be president and or George W. Bush or all these [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1867.3s)]
*  people, did Joe Biden like it just was the case that I think largely due to his age, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1873.5s)]
*  he was not capable of focusing and occupying the attentional space at the center of the [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1878.46s)]
*  presidency. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1883.66s)]
*  So you got to start with that. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1884.66s)]
*  Would that have would it have worked? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1887.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1888.3s)]
*  I believe Joe Biden in 67 wins reelection, that he can tell a story about his own record. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1889.3s)]
*  If you want my counterfactual, that's basically what I think. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1893.58s)]
*  I kind of agree with that. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1896.3s)]
*  And I'll say I kind of agree with that because this is arising with like all the fury I felt [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1897.38s)]
*  about it all year. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1901.86s)]
*  Going back a year, I talked to people, I will say, because of the way this conversation [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1904.26s)]
*  has happened at the absolute highest level of the Biden administration. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1909.78s)]
*  And one thing that they were not shy about saying when I had was making these arguments [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1913.98s)]
*  before I even made them publicly about can this guy really run again is I would hear [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1918.66s)]
*  something like, look, Joe Biden can perform the presidency, but he can't perform the presidency [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1923.1s)]
*  was the way it got put to me. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1928.66s)]
*  And they still thought it was OK to run him again, which shows an unbelievable devaluing [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1931.08s)]
*  at the highest levels of democratic politics of attention. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1937.44s)]
*  So OK, so that they thought it was OK. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1940.8s)]
*  They could just make this argument like this guy can't perform it. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1943.56s)]
*  But you know, I mean, that's entertainment. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1946.24s)]
*  This is a presidency. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1948.04s)]
*  It's not about, you know, who's the best celebrity or who can go on on Jimmy Kimmel. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1949.12s)]
*  But of course, it partly is. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1952.92s)]
*  So that's the first layer. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1957.3799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1958.3799999999999s)]
*  Which is the obsession with what is called the mainstream media, the legacy media, all [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1959.98s)]
*  of which is like understands as understandable, but is increasingly a conversation that like [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1965.14s)]
*  a relatively small part of the country is part of. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1969.74s)]
*  And they're still laser focused on that. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1974.66s)]
*  And again, I get that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1976.5400000000002s)]
*  And they're laser focused on it in terms of not making news. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1979.0200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1984.0600000000002s)]
*  Like, I think about this phrase all the time, like not making news as opposed to making [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1985.0600000000002s)]
*  news. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1987.82s)]
*  Making news means getting people's attention. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1989.26s)]
*  Not making news means not getting people's attention. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1990.86s)]
*  And the goal of a lot of Democrats always in their communication is to not make news. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1993.26s)]
*  And Donald Trump's goal is always to make news. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=1999.28s)]
*  Something that has been on my mind is it in a way, the fact that I keep hearing Democrats [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2002.84s)]
*  call this a media problem rather than say an attention problem reflects exactly the [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2007.02s)]
*  problem. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2012.58s)]
*  The issue that I think they're still in tuition. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2013.58s)]
*  I mean, the media as a linguistic construct sounds like an institutional thing that people [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2015.22s)]
*  control. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2022.14s)]
*  One way you might solve your media problem is Chris Hayes decides who goes on the Chris [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2023.14s)]
*  Hayes all in show on weeknights on MSNBC and you get him to book you. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2026.66s)]
*  Or a Joe Rogan of the left. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2033.66s)]
*  A Joe Rogan of the left. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2034.94s)]
*  That's my favorite phrase to come out of the election. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2035.94s)]
*  I think it reflects Democrats still thinking that media is something that broadcasters [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2038.54s)]
*  and gatekeepers control and the way to win it over is to win them over as opposed to [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2044.72s)]
*  something that you attract, right? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2050.44s)]
*  Media is something you get booked on. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2054.08s)]
*  Attention is something you attract. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2056.2000000000003s)]
*  Liberal Joe Rogan discourse actually drives me like insane. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2058.12s)]
*  Like I want to throw myself off of a bridge. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2060.7200000000003s)]
*  You can't build Joe Rogan if you're a political person. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2063.6s)]
*  You're trying to back it out as a... [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2068.0s)]
*  Because the whole point of what is meaningful about him, to the extent he's meaningful, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2069.92s)]
*  I'm not sure I'm using him a little bit as a stand in for a whole sort of world of culture [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2073.3199999999997s)]
*  that I think Democrats have kind of abandoned. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2077.68s)]
*  What's meaningful about him is fundamentally he's not for people interested in politics. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2080.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2084.56s)]
*  Democrats are obsessed with how New York Times exactly words its headlines about Donald Trump. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2085.56s)]
*  But Democrats win people who read New York Times headlines about Donald Trump. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2092.6s)]
*  They lose people who don't read politics at all. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2096.0s)]
*  And you can't win them by being more and more political and be like, we're going to create [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2099.52s)]
*  Joe Rogan but with perfect politics who makes everything Democrats do. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2103.04s)]
*  The whole point is that you have to go and compete in non-political spaces. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2106.68s)]
*  And you also have to get attention. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2112.12s)]
*  You have to get the attention of people the periphery of politics. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2113.68s)]
*  How do you get messages to people at the outer periphery? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2116.6s)]
*  And part of the answer is you need to draw a lot of attention generally. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2120.08s)]
*  And it's not like they didn't know this. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2123.8s)]
*  The idea of Beyonce, the idea of using celebrities, is like, wait, well, these are attentional [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2125.72s)]
*  magnets. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2131.04s)]
*  They're like avatars. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2132.04s)]
*  But increasingly, it just doesn't work that way anymore. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2133.04s)]
*  I do think a little bit. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2135.32s)]
*  I've been thinking about this, and I'm not sure I think what I'm about to say is right. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2136.32s)]
*  But I think a bit that the media attention cut I'm making was actually there in who the [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2139.96s)]
*  two sides treated as celebrities. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2147.68s)]
*  Because Democrats treated as celebrities, celebrities, Beyonce and Taylor Swift. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2150.38s)]
*  And there was kind of mocking like, well, look, they've got Kid Rock over there at the [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2155.8s)]
*  RNC. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2159.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2160.2s)]
*  And the celebrities that Republicans were relying on were UFC influencers and random [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2161.2s)]
*  podcasters. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2167.08s)]
*  And I do think there was a way in which this election in a background fashion was testing [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2168.08s)]
*  this question of, well, actually, who are the celebrities today, or at least in a persuasive [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2173.6s)]
*  level, who are the celebrities? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2177.7599999999998s)]
*  Because there were these very buttoned up celebrities where you would get one post from [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2179.96s)]
*  Taylor Swift or maybe Bad Bunny came in at the end. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2182.8199999999997s)]
*  And I'm not saying that stuff didn't help Democrats a bit. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2185.4399999999996s)]
*  And again, you can overstate how much any of it mattered. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2188.48s)]
*  But I do think there is a way of not seeing that in this world, like there are a bunch [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2191.6000000000004s)]
*  of people who are not named celebrities by the media, but they are influencers of massive [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2195.92s)]
*  power now because they're just like they're good at competing and getting attention and [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2202.5600000000004s)]
*  building direct relationships with our audience. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2205.86s)]
*  Steve Jobs had this saying that it's not the customer's job to know what they want. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2209.0800000000004s)]
*  And I do think there's a little bit of like democratic, like, obsession with numbers and [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2213.6000000000004s)]
*  market research that's like, what are the numbers say? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2218.26s)]
*  And part of this is just innovation and improvisation and trying new stuff that hasn't been tried [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2222.0600000000004s)]
*  before as opposed to backing out what you think the expectation is. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2227.1800000000003s)]
*  And that's really true, I think, with attention entrepreneurship, which is not just to like [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2230.7400000000002s)]
*  look what does best in the algorithm and not just look at the data, but to try new things. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2237.1800000000003s)]
*  Like I don't love Joe Rogan's politics, but I, Rogan's a really good podcast. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2242.94s)]
*  It's a really good show. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2247.9s)]
*  I have listened intermittently for years, particularly I used to more than I do now. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2248.9s)]
*  I've listened to Rogan podcasts where he does two and a half hours with an astrophysicist [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2254.74s)]
*  and they're totally fascinating. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2259.18s)]
*  I mean, part of the problem too, as I sort of think this through, right, there is an [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2260.18s)]
*  asymmetry about risk. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2264.42s)]
*  And I'm trying to figure out how like, it just is the case that like a gaffe for a democratic [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2266.74s)]
*  politician is going to kind of stick out more and stick more. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2273.5s)]
*  Partly I think as a self-enforcing cycle, which is that if you do less media, then the [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2277.86s)]
*  gaff stick more. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2281.86s)]
*  And partly because, well, I'll do this take and then you can cut it out. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2283.7s)]
*  We're definitely not cutting it out now. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2288.86s)]
*  Well this take has nothing to do with attention, but here's my take. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2293.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2295.78s)]
*  You're at a restaurant with your kids. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2296.78s)]
*  And the kid over there at the other table is just same age, just acting like crazy, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2301.22s)]
*  watching a screen, doesn't have their napkin, making a mess. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2306.14s)]
*  And your kid says, well, they don't have to do it. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2309.22s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't care about them. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2311.98s)]
*  It's not my kid. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2313.22s)]
*  I feel like that's how the mainstream media basically treats the democratic party. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2314.7799999999997s)]
*  And I think that's partly, it's partly the flip side of a correct conservative critique, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2320.8199999999997s)]
*  which is that the vast majority of people who work in the mainstream media are products [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2326.4199999999996s)]
*  of a cultural milieu that is generally center left in democratic voting. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2330.86s)]
*  But it means that they hold the Democrats to higher standards. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2336.38s)]
*  And like JD Vance and Donald Trump are those other kids at the table. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2340.34s)]
*  I don't care what they do. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2343.46s)]
*  They're not my kids. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2344.46s)]
*  And I truly believe this is true. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2346.46s)]
*  This kid got me in trouble. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2348.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2349.6600000000003s)]
*  I do think there's something to it, but I think there's one more link in the chain, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2352.3s)]
*  which is that the issue is that the people who vote for Democrats are influence, like [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2357.18s)]
*  to them, the mainstream media is influences. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2362.3799999999997s)]
*  And it isn't the case, right? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2365.42s)]
*  Or rather, it is the case that there are things Republicans can do in the media that are problems [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2367.3799999999997s)]
*  for them, like in certain ways, not be anti-immigrant enough. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2372.06s)]
*  Or say Donald Trump did not win the 2020 election. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2377.8199999999997s)]
*  They have their own gaff. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2380.58s)]
*  They have their own gaff. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2381.8199999999997s)]
*  They're just different. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2382.8199999999997s)]
*  Because the mainstream media for them is in the role of enemy, for the mainstream media [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2385.06s)]
*  to be mad at them, that's already the storylines. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2390.06s)]
*  So I was running these numbers because I was going to write a column about this, but I [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2393.58s)]
*  don't think I am now. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2396.7400000000002s)]
*  So I'll say it to you instead, which is that by 2000, Fox News is fairly, it is a big enough [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2397.7400000000002s)]
*  force that one can take it seriously. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2405.3s)]
*  Conservative talk radio is mature and is a big deal. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2408.1800000000003s)]
*  So look at the seven elections since 2000, presidential elections. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2411.58s)]
*  Republicans win the popular vote in two. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2415.9s)]
*  In the seven before, they win it in four. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2418.42s)]
*  Now, we know that Fox News persuades people to go right. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2421.5s)]
*  And we know that Fox News is watched by people. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2426.46s)]
*  And yet we also know that Republicans are performing worse as Fox News and right-wing [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2429.5s)]
*  media become more powerful. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2433.58s)]
*  And I would say the reason for that is that Fox News has made Republicans weirder. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2435.98s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2439.7799999999997s)]
*  Like detached them from the center. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2441.5s)]
*  I don't think Donald Trump is electorally optimal himself. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2444.46s)]
*  And so there's this weird way where you got to be very careful with this idea of like, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2446.62s)]
*  I want this propaganda machine because the first person the propaganda machine is going [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2450.42s)]
*  to convince is you. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2455.14s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2456.82s)]
*  And we see this in race after race after race. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2457.82s)]
*  This has really been one of these stories of the MAGA era is bad Republican candidates [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2461.58s)]
*  at all levels losing winnable races that they probably should have won because they were [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2467.9s)]
*  adhering to the exact same attentional incentives that produce Donald Trump up at the top. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2472.46s)]
*  And this happens in all kinds of races. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2478.82s)]
*  I mean, you know, even races that they win that are way closer than they should be. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2480.78s)]
*  So part of what's happening is this malformation of of the public, right? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2486.98s)]
*  This mouth of different publics of parties of different audiences is producing real pathologies [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2493.26s)]
*  that are in many cases, again, with among Republican candidates rejected by the people [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2499.26s)]
*  who are outside of that particular audience sphere that is being formed by that kind of [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2505.5s)]
*  propaganda. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2511.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's been all this post 2024 talk, some of it by me, about the problem of the [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2512.6200000000003s)]
*  groups on the Democratic side and the way they pull Democrats not just left but into [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2518.66s)]
*  a distance from the median voter. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2523.18s)]
*  They convince Democrats of things about the public that are not true. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2525.58s)]
*  The group that is saying we represent black voters, we represent Hispanic voters does [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2528.9s)]
*  not. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2534.14s)]
*  I think conservative media is like that, but much more powerful for the right. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2535.64s)]
*  It is given the right a very malformed view of the public. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2539.96s)]
*  Oh, I agree with that. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2542.66s)]
*  And it forces that view in a like a vicious way. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2543.98s)]
*  I think this is one place I think this is really true is on trans issues. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2547.94s)]
*  I think people are conflicted on questions of policy around this. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2552.38s)]
*  But I think one thing that is pretty clear, both from electoral results and from polling, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2557.46s)]
*  is that the public writ large is nowhere near as obsessed. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2562.5s)]
*  I mean, obsessed with this issue and with the lives and bodies of these fellow Americans [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2569.34s)]
*  of ours as the propaganda machine and the attentional, the attention merchants on the [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2575.7s)]
*  right are finding. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2582.3399999999997s)]
*  And again, they're covering that because it rates. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2584.58s)]
*  To be clear, there's a feedback loop here. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2586.8599999999997s)]
*  They're not just telling people to care about this. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2588.66s)]
*  There's a small group of people that do really care about it. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2590.62s)]
*  But I think it has been distorting for them. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2593.58s)]
*  And I think there's all kinds of races where they have closed with this message. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2595.02s)]
*  Well, I think that this issue is somewhere where, as you say, people are conflicted. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2598.98s)]
*  So if you can split the electorate or make the electorate think about the part where [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2605.46s)]
*  they side with the right, sports teams, right? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2610.98s)]
*  Their best message. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2616.14s)]
*  But the issue, I think that, and I've said this a bunch, that one reason, I mean, just [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2618.26s)]
*  even just politically, I think Democrats should be thoughtful about not veering too far. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2622.18s)]
*  What's about to come is cruelty. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2627.58s)]
*  And people don't like cruelty. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2628.94s)]
*  Most people don't like cruelty. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2632.86s)]
*  Some people like cruelty. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2635.02s)]
*  When I think of the damage Twitter ex did to Democrats, it came from 2020, not from [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2636.02s)]
*  2024. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2641.78s)]
*  It was this time when Democrats actually dominated Twitter and used it to do a lot of in-group [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2643.06s)]
*  policing and persuade themselves of a lot of electorally ruinous or unpopular ideas [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2648.7000000000003s)]
*  that then Republicans weaponized in 2024. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2655.2200000000003s)]
*  The fact that Republicans now have ex and I guess true social and it's run by Musk [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2660.18s)]
*  and Trump, it's not obvious to me that it's a net benefit. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2666.98s)]
*  Yeah, I would agree with that. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2671.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think that it's pretty clear to me that Musk's takeover has produced a kind [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2673.18s)]
*  of vibe shift and cultural influence for reactionary ideas that I think broadly benefits the right [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2680.2999999999997s)]
*  writ large, even if it sends a few Republican candidates over the cliff. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2687.9799999999996s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2693.06s)]
*  Like, and I think that so I think there's sometimes there's tradeoffs between that, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2693.58s)]
*  honestly, and I think that's probably that's true for Democrats, too. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2697.3399999999997s)]
*  Like, sometimes there are tradeoffs between ideas moving public opinion in one direction [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2699.5s)]
*  or another or normalizing things that seem ultra or radical that may cost, you know, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2704.7799999999997s)]
*  cost a few candidates elections. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2714.14s)]
*  And I think that those tradeoffs go in both directions. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2715.54s)]
*  The other thing is like, there's consequences here that are more than political, like literally [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2717.9799999999996s)]
*  tens of thousands of people die that shouldn't have died during the pandemic because they [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2722.62s)]
*  didn't get vaccinated. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2725.74s)]
*  And so there's like real tangible results to all of this that transcend politics and [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2728.02s)]
*  like, I mean, to me, that's one of the ways, though, that this might not play out well [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2736.06s)]
*  for the right. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2741.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2741.9799999999996s)]
*  That, for instance, a good possible example of this is that if the embrace of crypto [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2742.54s)]
*  culture leads to unwise levels of I wouldn't call it deregulation, but because these things [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2749.7s)]
*  aren't regulated really now, but structures of regulation that are shadowy. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2756.82s)]
*  So you have huge amounts of risk pooling in weird places. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2764.26s)]
*  You might have contagion in the financial sector because my Andy Lowry, my wife wrote [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2767.5s)]
*  a great piece about this in the Atlantic. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2771.94s)]
*  You might have contagion in the financial sector because financial firms begin reconstructing [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2773.7400000000002s)]
*  themselves as blockchain assets in order to go into later regulation and then use something [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2777.46s)]
*  that somebody doesn't understand or the regulators don't understand blow up. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2784.2200000000003s)]
*  And now you're blamed for it in the way that Bush and Republicans were in 08. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2788.62s)]
*  There's no guarantee that that happens. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2792.2200000000003s)]
*  It might not. But that's the kind of thing where that's the risk you're running. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2793.98s)]
*  I'm biased here and people listening to this who don't share my politics are free to write [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2798.06s)]
*  this off or not. But the center left, which still broadly consumes what we would call [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2802.3399999999997s)]
*  the mainstream media, legacy media, institutional media, that there's just more of this reality [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2807.66s)]
*  checking happening there. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2814.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, you know, there's a big fight about like, is inflation happening or is it not? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2816.2999999999997s)]
*  And then it was clear that inflation was happening. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2819.9399999999996s)]
*  It was very high. And you didn't get, you know, there are people who were talking about [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2821.66s)]
*  whether the inflation was the cause of the American rescue plan or whether it was really [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2827.26s)]
*  politically salient. But you didn't get a bunch of inflation truthers saying that the [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2831.1800000000003s)]
*  books were cooked or they were wrong or like inflation was high. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2835.82s)]
*  And that was that core fact suffused the coverage of all the people in that media [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2839.42s)]
*  ecosystem and sphere. But I think if you saw 9 percent inflation under Donald Trump, I [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2846.98s)]
*  think you would have had a kind of similar reaction to the election, the election, which [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2852.3s)]
*  is like, it's not happening. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2858.1800000000003s)]
*  Like, I think there's just a mechanism of denial, a mechanism of like sheer sort of [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2860.34s)]
*  cleaving off from reality in that attentional ecosystem that is distinct. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2865.5800000000004s)]
*  So the political scientist Henry Farrell had this good piece on a substack, an essay [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2870.7000000000003s)]
*  about he's saying we misunderstand the problem of social media. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2876.26s)]
*  And he had this analogy to porn. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2879.42s)]
*  And he says that the way he's working off somebody else's argument about porn, but he [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2882.02s)]
*  says, Internet porn is tuned not towards people who watch it, but people who buy it. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2886.02s)]
*  What Internet porn is trying to do is not get you to consume it for free, but to pay, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2892.26s)]
*  you know, nine ninety five a month or whatever. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2898.94s)]
*  And the people who will do that have more extreme tastes. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2901.5s)]
*  And so you have this ecosystem of pornography that is tilted to be more extreme because [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2904.54s)]
*  it's trying to get this actual conversion. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2910.42s)]
*  But it then creates this mass sense among the porn watching public that tastes are more [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2913.7799999999997s)]
*  extreme, that everybody else is into things that are more extreme. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2920.1s)]
*  It arguably changes people's tastes because you just get used to things. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2922.62s)]
*  And in that way, pornography malforms the public. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2926.2999999999997s)]
*  And his sort of argument is that social media is doing the same thing. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2929.42s)]
*  It is making everybody think that everybody else's tastes politically are more extreme [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2932.02s)]
*  than they are saying that everybody else is obsessed with a UK gang rape scandal from [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2936.18s)]
*  more than 10 years ago. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2941.98s)]
*  The effect is not just what it does to the public, but the way it warps the understanding [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2943.74s)]
*  of politicians and media figures who are looking at social media as if it is the public. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2951.22s)]
*  And his key point here, which I think is just the bedrock to for this analysis and [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2956.42s)]
*  so often left behind and so important, is that we're talking about collective understanding [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2961.7799999999997s)]
*  and collective publics as complicated organisms that are greater than the sum of their [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2966.7799999999997s)]
*  parts. Because as he writes in the piece, like a lot of this discourse is about individuals [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2973.9399999999996s)]
*  like this, a bunch of individuals hold these wrong beliefs. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2979.3799999999997s)]
*  But democracy is something we do together. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2984.54s)]
*  It's not a bunch of aggregated individual choices. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2987.22s)]
*  And I think this argument is completely correct. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2990.26s)]
*  And partly it's because we're also being constantly pulled towards things that are the [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=2992.86s)]
*  most potentially salient, which is just a distinct category from like at a bedrock from [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3000.34s)]
*  what we think is important. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3005.62s)]
*  I cannot stress this enough. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3006.86s)]
*  Attention is not a moral faculty. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3009.1s)]
*  There's a Lippman writing in 19-teens that I quote in the book. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3011.62s)]
*  It's during Versailles. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3016.58s)]
*  And he says, the American people have a great deal of interests in what happens at Versailles, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3018.14s)]
*  but they're not interested in it. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3025.54s)]
*  He's like, he's like in the same way that like a child has a real interest in his father's [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3029.06s)]
*  business, he's going to inherit, but he's not interested in it. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3032.9s)]
*  He's like, what we're interested in is like the gowns of the queen, basically. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3035.5s)]
*  Yeah. And it's pretty funny because it's bang on. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3038.74s)]
*  And the point is that we all understand. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3043.5s)]
*  We have a category of words going back to porn, like titillating, prurient, lurid, obscene, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3046.22s)]
*  that describe the category of things that we think that we both know draw our attention, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3055.9s)]
*  but are morally dubious. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3062.02s)]
*  And what happens in the sort of collective malformation around attention as the most [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3064.78s)]
*  signature value is the only thing that matters in this competitive landscape. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3072.5s)]
*  Is a kind of moral degradation because it's pulling us towards things that we know at [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3076.86s)]
*  some level aren't that important or morally defensible, but do get our attention. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3084.98s)]
*  OK, so I think this actually brings up a good, very counter to this conversation question, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3090.18s)]
*  which is maybe the optimal strategy. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3097.42s)]
*  If your vision, your sense of the public, your politics, maybe your own faculties are so [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3102.1800000000003s)]
*  warped by competing for this volume of attention is to not play. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3107.42s)]
*  So in 2020, Joe Biden is the least online and the least attentionally sophisticated [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3113.1400000000003s)]
*  or even interested of any of the Democrats running for president. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3119.02s)]
*  And I don't think that is unrelated to him winning, to why he won in 2020, certainly [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3123.5s)]
*  one in the primary and possibly even one in the general, because he had lots of problems [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3129.9s)]
*  as a candidate. He was, I think, too old to be running effectively even then, or at least [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3134.38s)]
*  very much on the edge. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3140.46s)]
*  But he was diminished from what he once was. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3142.02s)]
*  But his sense of the electorate had not been driven back. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3145.38s)]
*  Now formed. Yes, that's a great point. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3149.54s)]
*  And so he didn't get on board with a bunch of dumb things. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3151.58s)]
*  Other people were getting on board with. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3154.1s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3156.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, we're kind of implying that like the right strategy here is a is an embrace [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3157.94s)]
*  in the way, some kind of alternative, but still embrace like what we're seeing from [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3163.38s)]
*  Trump and Musk. Maybe it's the opposite. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3167.5s)]
*  And think about this for candidates. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3169.82s)]
*  I mean, you know, after Bush won in 2004, when there was a version of the discourse [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3171.3s)]
*  we're going through now, the idea is like, you know what we need? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3179.02s)]
*  A black guy with a foreign sounding name who is a former professor and community [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3182.94s)]
*  organizer. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3186.42s)]
*  Constitutional law professor. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3187.62s)]
*  That was ludicrous. Like what we need is like a guy you can have a beer with who also [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3189.54s)]
*  has a ranch. And like, that's what we need. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3193.82s)]
*  And it was like, no, we needed something totally different. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3195.86s)]
*  Two things. One, I think it is important, again, to distinguish between like, what is [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3198.62s)]
*  this doing to people more broadly and what is it doing to political professionals? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3202.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes. You know, and I think it's extremely dangerous for political professionals to read [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3205.42s)]
*  social media as representative of the public. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3209.6600000000003s)]
*  I also think you shouldn't just ignore it as online or Twitter is not real life because [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3212.38s)]
*  increasingly there is no distinction between the two. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3218.02s)]
*  But there are different selves that we have. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3220.54s)]
*  There's a self that wants to read a novel and the self that scrolls Instagram. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3224.86s)]
*  There's, you know, the self that doesn't want to eat that third cookie and the self [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3228.02s)]
*  that does eat the third cookie. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3232.38s)]
*  There are different publics, too, in that same way. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3234.5s)]
*  Within the public, there's a public that feels very compassionate towards immigrants, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3238.42s)]
*  feels proud of America being a nation of immigrants, and there's a public that is [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3243.58s)]
*  feels like they're being ripped off and invaded. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3247.58s)]
*  And sometimes they're the same people, often the same people. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3250.7s)]
*  But Farrell's whole point is that these these publics reform collectively. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3253.62s)]
*  So I think it's important, A, the political professionals don't make this simple [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3256.7799999999997s)]
*  representational mistake, which I agree with you, has led to a lot of poor choices. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3260.22s)]
*  Like people on this social media platform are screaming to me about this means [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3264.4599999999996s)]
*  there's some constituency behind them. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3269.1s)]
*  And yet, as the line between reality and online breaks down, the vanguard of people [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3272.18s)]
*  screaming really do have cultural significance. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3280.3799999999997s)]
*  That's true. But here's one of my big theories, and we'll know in four, eight years, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3284.1s)]
*  if I'm right. I think we are ready or very near ready. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3288.62s)]
*  And I see it in the states and counties banning phones in schools and just like the [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3292.7000000000003s)]
*  discourse for true backlash. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3297.1800000000003s)]
*  And yes, I think that the next really successful Democrat, although it could be [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3301.6600000000003s)]
*  a Republican, is going to be oppositional to it in the way that when Barack Obama [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3307.94s)]
*  ran in 08, and I really think people forget this part of his appeal, he ran [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3312.1s)]
*  against cable news, against 24 hour news cycles, against political consultants. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3315.86s)]
*  People didn't like the structure and feeling of political tension then. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3320.26s)]
*  And I don't think there was anywhere near the level of disgust and concern and [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3326.7400000000002s)]
*  feeling that we were being corroded in our souls that there is now. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3331.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think that at some point you are going to see a candidate come up who is [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3335.82s)]
*  going to weaponize this feeling, right? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3341.42s)]
*  That they are going to run not against Facebook as a meta as a big company that [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3344.5s)]
*  needs to be broken up. All of it. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3348.62s)]
*  They're going to run against all of it, that like society and modernity and [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3350.06s)]
*  politics shouldn't feel like this. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3353.06s)]
*  And some of that will be banning phones in schools, right? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3355.54s)]
*  It'll have a dimension that is policy. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3357.7s)]
*  But some of it is going to be just absolutely like radiating a disgust for [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3360.9s)]
*  what it is doing to us and to ourselves. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3367.74s)]
*  I mean, your book has a lot of this in it. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3370.2999999999997s)]
*  I think that political space is weirdly open, but it seems very clear to me [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3373.06s)]
*  somebody is going to grab it. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3376.98s)]
*  I could not agree more, even before we get to politics, you know, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3377.98s)]
*  thorough for president. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3382.9s)]
*  But not thorough. I really think this is important, right? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3385.46s)]
*  It's not somebody... [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3387.62s)]
*  Well, you can't drop out and run for president. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3389.2200000000003s)]
*  It's not somebody who is withdrawing and wants to live on a lake. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3390.98s)]
*  There are people like that, right? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3393.82s)]
*  It's more like John Haidt. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3395.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3396.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3397.14s)]
*  It's more like what he is channeling, I mean, but channeled into politics, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3397.46s)]
*  which is an actual anger at it. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3400.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3402.9s)]
*  It is not supposed to feel this way. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3403.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3406.3s)]
*  And I don't think it's just going to be like, we're going to get rid of tech talk, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3406.98s)]
*  but it is going to be something about this culture and society has fallen. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3411.1s)]
*  I think it's a keen insight. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3416.58s)]
*  I agree. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3418.98s)]
*  And what I thought about is like, sometimes you'll read historical [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3419.54s)]
*  dispatches from like peak industrial London. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3422.94s)]
*  And people are just being like, this is the most disgusting place that has [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3426.54s)]
*  ever been put on God's earth. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3430.7s)]
*  Like it's just sewage and coal ash in the sky. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3432.46s)]
*  Satanic mills. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3438.34s)]
*  Just satanic mills. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3439.14s)]
*  It's just the sheer stench and just like, what have we done? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3440.34s)]
*  How far from God we have fallen in this? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3445.2200000000003s)]
*  And they were right. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3447.78s)]
*  Like genuinely, it was genuinely disgusting. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3448.5s)]
*  And you know, it did reach a point with all of these things, particularly the [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3452.06s)]
*  worst depredations of the industrial revolution, where people had enough and [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3455.38s)]
*  they're, you know, having enough rep was represented in a million different [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3460.5s)]
*  political tendencies, cultural movements, manifestations. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3464.94s)]
*  And we are at that point. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3468.66s)]
*  I mean, in the course of writing this book, I mean, literally from the [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3470.98s)]
*  conceptualization of this book for an essay that I wrote, you know, 2022 to this [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3474.86s)]
*  book coming out now, we've already moved a tremendous amount. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3479.5s)]
*  I mean, when I first started telling people about this book, I'm like, huh, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3483.98s)]
*  attention, huh? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3486.62s)]
*  And now it's like, right. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3487.78s)]
*  I'm saying I've been obsessed with this for years. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3489.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, you have for sure. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3491.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3492.1400000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3492.94s)]
*  And I think you and I are pretty disposed to be obsessed with it because the [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3493.78s)]
*  universe in which we operate is like, we're constantly trying to sort of screen [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3496.7000000000003s)]
*  information, get the good information, you know, protect our attention, try to [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3503.7000000000003s)]
*  think in a way that's productive. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3508.5800000000004s)]
*  But I just think the ubiquity of this, I mean, yes, I think there is an, there's [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3511.2200000000003s)]
*  an wellspring, an untapped wellspring. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3515.78s)]
*  For a total rebellion against the way it feels to be inside your mind at this [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3519.42s)]
*  particular moment with this particular form of attention capitalism and the way [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3526.26s)]
*  it feels to be inside, like the collective's mind. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3530.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3533.34s)]
*  Even I know a good number of Trump supporters and they may like him, but they [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3534.0600000000004s)]
*  don't like how, not how he feels, but how all this feels. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3538.82s)]
*  No, no one likes it. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3541.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3542.6600000000003s)]
*  The nobody likes it. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3542.82s)]
*  No one likes it. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3544.02s)]
*  Like that, that is there, right. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3545.54s)]
*  It's the thing that Obama is very good at working with, right. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3547.0600000000004s)]
*  That is there in its modern version, I think, to derive energy from. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3549.22s)]
*  Before any of that happens though, he's going to be president again. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3554.7799999999997s)]
*  You've probably heard. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3557.7799999999997s)]
*  And I'm just, I'm just hearing this now. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3559.38s)]
*  How do you think, I'm sure you're thinking about this. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3561.7799999999997s)]
*  How's your coverage of Trump in 2025 and his White House, knowing everything we [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3563.7799999999997s)]
*  know about the way attention works under his presidency, going to be [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3568.46s)]
*  different than it was in 2017? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3573.18s)]
*  The one thing that I tried really hard in the first term, which I thought was [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3574.74s)]
*  important and I think I mostly succeeded at, but certainly not always was modulation. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3579.1s)]
*  That, that, that to me is a central question of modulation. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3584.3399999999997s)]
*  If you turn the dial on the stereo to 10 and leave it there, it will sound like [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3588.4199999999996s)]
*  five eventually, and then you can't turn it up past 10. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3593.8599999999997s)]
*  And this was something I, I was intentional about the first time, but I [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3599.5s)]
*  think even more intentional now. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3603.5s)]
*  And I think you see some of this, like literally no one's saying anything about [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3604.62s)]
*  Marco Rubio as secretary of state. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3608.58s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3610.58s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3611.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's a perfectly, that's fine. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3611.9s)]
*  I mean, wouldn't be my choice, but I don't get to choose and wouldn't be a [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3614.22s)]
*  democratic president's choice, but that's not to say that like no one should raise [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3618.18s)]
*  any concerns. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3622.54s)]
*  I just think in terms of coverage. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3623.14s)]
*  Let me ask you something about the negativity bias and the incentives it sets up. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3623.94s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3628.98s)]
*  Obviously the future of the Republican party is going to be a lot more [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3629.9s)]
*  negative than the future of the Republican party. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3632.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3634.86s)]
*  And I think that the future of the Republican party is not highly determined [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3635.06s)]
*  by what MSNBC hosts say about different Trump appointees, but there is something [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3639.34s)]
*  about a world where Marco Rubio gets no coverage for being a, who knows what kind [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3644.3s)]
*  of secretary of state he'll be, but plausibly a more normal, thoughtful, you [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3651.54s)]
*  know, Marco Rubio is a politician who works hard and like tries to think about [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3656.34s)]
*  ideas. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3659.62s)]
*  He's also genuinely qualified for it. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3659.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3662.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3662.62s)]
*  In this world where we say that there is value to attention and we give all this [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3663.58s)]
*  attentional resource to the worst people making them more valuable to Trump and [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3669.06s)]
*  squeezing it. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3675.06s)]
*  Setup by that, like I never know what to do with his thought, which I've had for [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3679.26s)]
*  a long time, because on the one hand, you can't just ignore the terrible things [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3682.34s)]
*  happening in government. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3686.7s)]
*  That's a dereliction of what we're here to do. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3687.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3689.26s)]
*  And on the other hand, if you believe that just giving things attention is to give them energy, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3689.42s)]
*  to only cover the terrible things happening in government, is to, you know, not empower like the Doug Burghams and Marco Rubio's in the future. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3695.42s)]
*  Like there feels like some tension here that the media has never known what to do with. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3704.42s)]
*  I think that's interesting. I mean, I think that I don't know, I don't have a worked out theory for how to deal with that, but I think it's a good point. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3707.42s)]
*  I have a broader thing I've been thinking about a lot. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3714.42s)]
*  This phrase that has been is like on a brainstorming notepad of mine, and I've thought about a million versions of it. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3717.42s)]
*  The phrase is the opposite of doom. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3725.42s)]
*  And I think about this a lot because I think that we live in a doom obsessed time, doom scrolling. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3728.42s)]
*  We do not live in an age in which we have a conception of the opposite of doom. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3733.42s)]
*  We do not live in an age where we have a lot of conceptualizations of utopias. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3737.42s)]
*  You know, there's different ages where all sorts of different people are planning their utopias. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3742.42s)]
*  Spiritual leaders, architects, political leaders. This is it. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3746.42s)]
*  This is what it's going to look like when we figure it all out. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3750.42s)]
*  No one does that anymore. I mean, literally no one does that. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3753.42s)]
*  Like I can't think of a modern contemporary version of utopia. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3756.42s)]
*  Maybe in some some version that sort of Trump, I'll fix everything personalist is the closest we get. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3760.42s)]
*  Personalist vision of fixing everything. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3766.42s)]
*  And the reason I think I think about this is I think it's probably really important to us in our collective public and individually to put our attention towards a vision of what we think something great would be. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3769.42s)]
*  And it relates to this question about the individual coverage decisions, which are absolutely affected by negativity bias, like 100 percent and conflict, too. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3784.42s)]
*  Like there's a fight over eggs as there should be. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3794.42s)]
*  And there's not a fight over Rubio and the conflict drives the news. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3797.42s)]
*  I mean, that's as old as news. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3800.42s)]
*  But the reason I bring all this up is because I sometimes think about it just in terms of like putting attention on things that have worked as opposed to things that haven't worked. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3803.42s)]
*  So not so much about individuals or members of the cabinet. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3812.42s)]
*  But like I was thinking about this the other day, like 30 years ago, it just was inconceivable we would cure HIV AIDS. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3817.42s)]
*  And it was it's amazing that we essentially have. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3825.42s)]
*  And we've done it through the labor and work of people across all sectors of society over the course of decades. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3829.42s)]
*  They took a thing that just felt horrible and intractable and made it so much better. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3837.42s)]
*  And there's just so much less attention on those stories. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3845.42s)]
*  And I think it is making it harder and harder for us to conceptualize that it is possible even to do good things and to solve problems. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3848.42s)]
*  All right. I have a lot of thoughts on this. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3859.42s)]
*  One is that I mean, you and I both know there have been a million efforts in journalism to do solutions based journalism. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3863.42s)]
*  Yes. Right. Good news. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3870.42s)]
*  Good news journalism. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3871.42s)]
*  And they don't work in part not that they don't work at all. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3873.42s)]
*  But they're it's. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3876.42s)]
*  And this is as you make the point of, you know, at the beginning of this conversation and often in your book, attention is a business. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3877.42s)]
*  So when they don't work, you your cable news show gets replaced with somebody who will do do. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3885.42s)]
*  On the other hand, one of the things I really believe about the podcasting world, one thing that makes me very hopeful about it is these podcasts have built, you know, huge, unbelievably huge audiences not being primarily about doom. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3893.42s)]
*  Agreed. Right. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3908.42s)]
*  They don't actually have a big negativity bias. They're very hopeful. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3909.42s)]
*  They're futuristic. Right. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3911.42s)]
*  The obvious thing to say is the opposite of doom is hope. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3913.42s)]
*  But I think the opposite of doom is curiosity, at least in this respect. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3916.42s)]
*  I don't think it's utopia. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3921.42s)]
*  I think it's something about curiosity, interest, beauty. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3922.42s)]
*  There is this way that doom is a doom is a belief that we know how things are going to go comforting in its own way because of comforting in its own way because of that. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3925.42s)]
*  And mystery feels to me like an opposite of that. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3935.42s)]
*  And that there is a dimension here where I think what has gone wrong in a lot of this journalism is it feels hokey and cliche. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3939.42s)]
*  And it has, you know, it is actually too much the opposite of doom when the problem is like you want to be on another dimension entirely. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3947.42s)]
*  That like if the only question is things go good, things go bad. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3957.42s)]
*  Things go bad is more attention grabbing. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3961.42s)]
*  If the question is things go bad or are there UFOs, things go bad or like this novelist speaks unbelievably beautiful because I see it in the ratings of this show. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3964.42s)]
*  Right. I can get very high downloads for Trump episodes and very high pretty over time downloads for a novelist who describes the world in a really beautiful way. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3975.42s)]
*  I don't think the opposite of doom is hope or good things or utopia. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3984.42s)]
*  I think for this, for attention, it's curiosity. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3988.42s)]
*  It's curiosity. It's interesting. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3991.42s)]
*  It's like, oh, have you ever thought about it this way? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3993.42s)]
*  Or isn't that weird? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3995.42s)]
*  I want to make a point that I'm afraid is like boringly technical after what you just said, which I am chewing on. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=3998.42s)]
*  I also think the back, the technological infrastructure of podcast matters tremendously. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4006.42s)]
*  You've talked about that, that that line from I forget who wrote wherever you get your podcast is a radical statement that the fact that podcasts have built audiences largely outside of algorithmic feeds. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4011.42s)]
*  Have built them through an open protocol called RSS that that technical backbone actually matters for precisely what you're talking about. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4025.42s)]
*  Part of the reason podcasts have first two, three hour podcasts, podcasts with novelists about obscure topics, long solo monologues about history. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4034.42s)]
*  I mean, all sorts of, you know, all sorts of stuff is because they're not embedded in the same technical attentional marketplace. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4042.42s)]
*  And I think that really matters a lot. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4053.42s)]
*  And I think it's actually really hopeful because I think one of the things to remember here, this is really an important point. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4055.42s)]
*  Everyone has wiped this from their memory. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4062.42s)]
*  But the first version of the mass Internet was a entirely commercially engineered mass Internet with Prodigy, CompuServe and AOL. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4064.42s)]
*  AOL merges the winner. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4072.42s)]
*  AOL acquired Time Warner. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4073.42s)]
*  AOL was the belle of the ball in this huge company. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4075.42s)]
*  And it was a walled garden and you dialed up and you were in this little world that was curated by these large commercial entities. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4077.42s)]
*  And that was destroyed partly ironically because of Mark Andreessen's development of a graphical user interface to a noncommercial open Internet that rewarded curiosity, that rewarded people connecting about obscure topics. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4083.42s)]
*  It rewarded hobbyism. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4099.42s)]
*  It rewarded obsessive small little corners of knowledge. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4101.42s)]
*  It's already been the case once that an open Internet animated by curiosity defeated a closed commercial Internet. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4104.42s)]
*  It doesn't have to be the case that the version of the commercial Internet we have now is still the same one. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4112.42s)]
*  So that to me is really hopeful, though, you know, because it's like it's we we have divided cells. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4119.42s)]
*  We have divided desires. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4126.42s)]
*  There's different parts of us that different want different things and different markets that we're in. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4128.42s)]
*  Market setups, technical setups, institutional setups can cultivate different parts of those cells. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4133.42s)]
*  It's not like we lose one part or another. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4139.42s)]
*  The other part is still there. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4142.42s)]
*  It's a question about the systems around us drawing forth those different parts of us or not. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4143.42s)]
*  I think that is a good place to end. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4150.42s)]
*  Always our final question. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4152.42s)]
*  What three books you would recommend to the audience? [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4153.42s)]
*  So so first I'll start with a classic, which is Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4156.42s)]
*  The Goat. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4160.42s)]
*  The Goat in this in this discourse, I think it still totally holds up the first chapter, which is somewhat predicts Donald Trump. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4161.42s)]
*  Yes, totally. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4167.42s)]
*  In an explicit way. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4168.42s)]
*  Yes, totally. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4170.42s)]
*  Yes, in an explicit way. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4171.42s)]
*  Also, you know, the first essay, which is just about the sort of different versions of the dystopian future between 1984, which is information constraint and Brave New World, which is overflow of entertainment information about how we ended up in the Brave New World. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4173.42s)]
*  Great. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4187.42s)]
*  Another book that has been mentioned on your podcast a lot and relevant, which is, again, I feel like I'm sort of citing canonical text here. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4189.42s)]
*  And it's important for me to do because I want to be clear, as we all are as authors, you know, lots of people have been thinking about this very well, very hard. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4196.42s)]
*  But Jenny O'Dell's How to Do Nothing is a fantastic book. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4204.42s)]
*  It's strange and distinct and and and is much more, I would say, like spiritually omnivorous than the book that I've written. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4208.42s)]
*  More sort of interior interior and its focus to about how you kind of do this work with yourself and with other people as a kind of like collective radical undertaking. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4218.42s)]
*  Yeah, the form of that book is also the function because I feel like so much of what books about attention are about is how it homogenizes all of us. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4230.42s)]
*  And that book, I love that book so much. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4238.42s)]
*  It is a completely distinct product. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4240.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4242.42s)]
*  Completely distinct mind. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4243.42s)]
*  Like no other human being would write that book. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4244.42s)]
*  No other human being would write that book. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4246.42s)]
*  There's no comp for that book. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4247.42s)]
*  It is its own thing. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4248.42s)]
*  And it's also a book. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4249.42s)]
*  I love books like that. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4250.42s)]
*  I love books like that, too. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4251.42s)]
*  And I also think it's a rare thing to write a nonfiction book where you where you can't get 85 percent of the way there by just like hearing the author on a podcast or reading a review like you got to actually read the book. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4252.42s)]
*  And then my final work of fiction of short stories by an author named Tony Tula Tammudi called Rejection. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4262.42s)]
*  And it is the bleakest. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4270.42s)]
*  Not safe for work, friends. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4273.42s)]
*  Not safe for work. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4275.42s)]
*  It is the bleakest and one of the most unremittingly punishing pictures of the hell that we've built for ourselves. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4278.42s)]
*  And yet I say this, that doesn't sound like a book you want to read. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4287.42s)]
*  I absolutely tore through it. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4290.42s)]
*  I read the whole thing in basically a day and it just stuck with me and I really recommend it highly. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4292.42s)]
*  One of the most intense reading experiences. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4297.42s)]
*  There is there is a 10 to 12 page granular description of a sexual fantasy in this book. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4302.42s)]
*  That is that your full body will basically you will like hit a point of physical paralysis as you read this. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4309.42s)]
*  But also can't stop reading and also are so amused. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4323.42s)]
*  It's so funny and it's so dark. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4326.42s)]
*  And it there's I've never read anything like it. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4328.42s)]
*  Chris A's your book is great. I recommend it to everybody. Thank you. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4330.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgcdl7pFNE&t=4333.42s)]
