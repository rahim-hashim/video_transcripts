# What Tom Hanks Thinks of America
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [July 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iWImRJkW1s)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  I hate to do this because I know the cliche when the host says, my guest today needs no
*  introduction.
*  But what, I'm really going to sit here and introduce who Tom Hanks is to you.
*  It's a waste of your time and mine.
*  But he does have a new book out, the making of another major motion picture masterpiece,
*  which follows up his short story collection, Uncommon Type, both of which are real delight.
*  And there's a reason I wanted to have this conversation.
*  And I'm going to try to let it unfold, but I've always been interested in Hanks as a
*  kind of interpreter of America.
*  And also somebody who gets something that has often fallen out of fashion, both politically
*  and culturally, even as it maintains a huge amount of strength and appeal, which is the
*  power of sincerity in American culture and the way in which there's this constant push
*  and pull between elite intellectual culture, which is more cynical, which is more ironic,
*  and mass culture, which is more sincere, many ways patriotic, at least wants to believe
*  that we all can agree on things, even if the people in it don't all agree on things.
*  And Hanks is somebody who's navigated the currents of this for a very long time now,
*  very adroitly.
*  I don't think you can have played the role as the movie star everybody can agree on,
*  right?
*  The nice guy of American movies for this long in this many changing versions of America
*  without understanding something pretty deep about the American psyche.
*  So that was the conversation I wanted to have with him here.
*  And it was a lot of fun.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at ny times.com.
*  Tom Hanks, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks for having me, Ezra Klein.
*  So I wanted to start in your earlier book of short stories, Uncommon Type.
*  And in that book, you have a typewriter appearing in every single story.
*  You've talked a lot in different interviews about your love of typewriters.
*  And I'm going to admit to being a cynic here, I thought this was maybe a cute affectation.
*  So you had a hobby for the public.
*  Then one of our producers, Kristen Lynn, wandered into Gramercy Typewriter Company in New York.
*  And the owner told her that you text him photos of typewriters you see in your travels with
*  questions about them.
*  So this is clearly real.
*  What attracts you to typewriters?
*  The permanence of a typewriter.
*  When I was a kid, my dad, who on the GI Bill went to USC, he got out of the Navy, he was
*  in the Pacific, and he bought a secondhand Remington typewriter.
*  He ended up being a professor.
*  He taught restaurant and hotel food preparation at Laney College in Oakland, California.
*  And he would type his tests in his syllabus.
*  On this ancient typewriter, he had such a vicious pounding nature when it came to physical
*  work that the letters on the most used keys, the S and the E, were literally worn away
*  to different shapes than the rest of the keys.
*  And I would hunt and peck on that as a little kid, but it was this formidable, ancient piece
*  of gimcrackery that had survived my dad's youth.
*  And I looked upon it as it might have been the only thing my dad had that was pre-my
*  existence.
*  And so my handwriting is atrocious.
*  And there is a story in the collection called These Are the Meditations of My Heart.
*  And though it is a female protagonist, it is the story of how I got my first quality
*  typewriter, a machine designed and engineered for the recording, permanent recording of
*  your thoughts and wishes and love letters and memos and shopping lists.
*  And when I walked home from a Westside Cleveland business office machines with a Hermes 2000
*  typewriter, I knew I had then with me the vehicle for a type of permanence that I did
*  not have in other parts of my life.
*  I must say, I will confess, that machine is long gone, lost to a lot of moves and my kids
*  pounding the living daylights out of it until it became in disrepair.
*  But I have since replaced it.
*  And I do get other typewriters and I always travel with one.
*  And here's the thing, though, Ezra, it's one thing to own typewriters, it's something
*  else completely to use them.
*  And I type every single day.
*  My main personal correspondence is in typewriters.
*  I send letters all the time and sometimes I have any number of people that I keep a
*  regular correspondence with because a typewritten letter is never thrown away.
*  That's one thing.
*  And two, if you take care of it, it will last as long as the carvings on the stone wall
*  of the Temple of Karnak in Egypt.
*  You are not just applying words onto paper, you are stamping them into the fibers with
*  permanent ink.
*  And there's something about that that I find very, very romantic.
*  And I will also say permanent.
*  And that is why I have way too many typewriters.
*  And Ezra Klein, if you were to say to me right now, well, I'd like a typewriter, one would
*  be on your desk in about two and a half weeks from my collection under the promise, however,
*  that you use it every single day.
*  That's a lot of power to hold.
*  Can I admit something to you and to our vast audience?
*  I think that's the purpose of any podcast, Ezra.
*  I've never learned to type.
*  I am even today a hunt and peck typer.
*  I can do 85 words a minute hunt and peck, but I guess like your father who had, I think
*  you described it as a thunderous typing.
*  One of my good friends used to call me the black Sabbath of typing because it's so loud.
*  I've been in press conferences with Nancy Pelosi and others and I've had staffers come
*  to shush my typing because it was distracting the principal from...
*  On a laptop?
*  On a laptop?
*  That is the force with which I hunt and peck.
*  Well, how many of those have you used up in your career?
*  My God, if you're actually flying physical pressure onto a laptop, they got to take a
*  beating.
*  It's tough karma to be my laptop keyboard.
*  But wait, wait, you never learned essentially touch typing?
*  Never.
*  QWERTY, AA, A-space, FFF space, really?
*  Yeah, it keeps being on my list.
*  I took a summer class in it for a minute.
*  This is definitely what people came to this podcast to hear me telling you about my typing,
*  I took a summer class in it for a minute, but I had a lot of trouble paying attention
*  in those days and just dropped out or didn't complete it or didn't learn it or whatever.
*  And then I just was, I don't know, good enough hunting pecker, but I've been meaning to go
*  back to this.
*  So it is one of my goals for the next couple of years to actually learn how to type.
*  By the way, 85 words per minute, this is nothing.
*  The speed of which one types has nothing to do with it.
*  It's the thoroughness with which one types.
*  When you start typing and you do not stop typing until you get to the end of the idea,
*  that's the only thing that matters.
*  That is fair.
*  I probably type 30 words a minute because I keep going back and forth and trying to
*  figure out what I really want to say.
*  Well, let's get to that question of what you want to say, because what I always like about
*  thinking about the way people write is that different mediums and technologies, you do
*  think differently in them.
*  I would write a different piece on a typewriter from writing it in the iPhone notes app and
*  writing it on my laptop from writing it by hand where I have terrible, I guess like you
*  handwriting.
*  So how do you think differently on the typewriter?
*  What is different about the words that come out than if you're doing them on a computer
*  and a notebook?
*  A pondering is the way I would say it.
*  Knowing that it's going down and it is going to be permanent.
*  Look, I'm not against going back and just X-ing out everything on the line and then
*  starting all over again or just stopping a paragraph and then beginning again fresh at
*  the top.
*  But there is sort of like a curly cued thought process that goes where I do write slower
*  than I think, but the paradox is I end up typing almost as fast as the final version
*  of what I want to say does come out.
*  Because it is going to be down there forever and there's no such thing as a delete key
*  and I don't even pull the paper out and rip it up and throw it away unless there's so
*  many typos in it that none of it makes sense.
*  But it's going to last a very long time if you end up saying this is what is complete.
*  So I do go a little bit slower, but I also want it to read as though it's more like a
*  Kurosawa screenplay than it is one of my own.
*  I want it to have some jazz to it somehow and sometimes that can be an overuse of ellipses
*  and sometimes it can be starting a sentence with the same word over and over again.
*  And this is the stuff that you end up putting into everything from a letter to somebody
*  that you don't know very well to something that I'm just leaving for my wife in the
*  morning because I'm out of the house at 6.30 and I know she's not going to see me until
*  on in the evening.
*  But I guess to have the same sort of sense of gravitas that whatever I typed on a piece
*  of paper was thought about was not just thrown off the cuff like you would a text or an email
*  or something in your notes.
*  This is how insane I am.
*  I have one rig at home.
*  I built a desk myself while I designed it and a friend of mine who was good with wood
*  helped me build it.
*  And what it is, it's the right height for a typing table.
*  And I took a Hermes Media Professional Quality typewriter and I bolted it to a flip up surface
*  so I can type anything I want to and then pull the paper out, flip up the typewriter
*  so it's up and out of the way and then on the surface below it address it, make any
*  changes or whatever and sign it and off it goes.
*  So that's one aspect that's insane about it.
*  The other aspect is I went out and bought a huge box of old school dot matrix printer
*  paper, the type that is perforated and has the, what do you call them?
*  It has the things on the sides.
*  The sides with like the little holes that you tear off?
*  With little holes, sprockets.
*  It has sprockets on it.
*  I did not know that word.
*  Okay, let's call it sprockets on a dot matrix printer.
*  And essentially I have one piece of paper that can be like three and a half miles long.
*  I roll that in and I can go for anywhere from three to seven pages without having to stop.
*  That's how it gets you, Ezra.
*  That's how it gets you.
*  So is a new book written on a typewriter?
*  A lot of it was, but nothing anything that counted.
*  I mean I do all sorts of paragraphs and notes and ideas and outlines on it and I oftentimes
*  don't use any of it at all.
*  And they say, why in the world would you do that, Hanks?
*  And the reason is because the percussiveness of it, the sound, the rhythm, it ends up being
*  like a bit of a snare drum that I can feel in my bones as I go around.
*  And when I can really get going on it, the sound and the rhythm of the chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk is the sound of, it almost like
*  is a Charlie Chaplin score for modern times or something like that.
*  It's like...
*  It makes me feel like I end up getting into some sort of like a zone that I hear and see
*  and feel all at the same time.
*  I think I compare the sound of that as like a ball-peen hammer on an anvil as you're pounding
*  out a horseshoe, as opposed to typing on a laptop, which is like just a little clicking
*  of knitting needles.
*  Sometimes I just need the bigger volume.
*  I need the heavier sound.
*  So the new book is called The Making of Another Major Motion Picture Masterpiece, and it is
*  about a movie called the masterpiece in question, Nightshade, The Lath of Firefall, and that
*  movie is built on a comic.
*  So tell me about the comic you've invented in the book.
*  Tell me about the source material at the center of this little universe.
*  Source material for motion pictures oftentimes go back to the thought that was in somebody's
*  head when they were six years old.
*  I've talked to any number of the directors who remember seeing something, not necessarily
*  from the movie, but witnessing something in their lives that has always hung with them.
*  And in this case, one of the characters saw a comic book when he was only five, and it
*  was right after World War II, and there were an awful lot of stories out of the war.
*  And in the coin of the realm of this day and age, it ends up being incorporated into a
*  longstanding series of superheroes.
*  And there's a superhero by the name of Eve Knight who becomes Nightshade, and she has
*  incredible powers that she's trying to flee from, and she can never sleep.
*  And she envisions being haunted by this flamethrower who ends up entering into her life in order
*  to come for her grandfather, who himself was a veteran of World War II.
*  And so the vernacular here is one of a superhero battle of powers and wits and sensuality that
*  has kind of been the coin of the realm now for quite some time.
*  And so in order to write a book about the making of a movie, the special effects-laden
*  superhero movie seemed to be recognizable enough without having to get into too many
*  of the specifics.
*  I wanted to spend a moment in the comic, because I'm a comics nerd, and you stretched across
*  something that I think is interesting there, which is the original inspiring comic.
*  There's a lot of scenes in the book of 1950s, 1960s Americana.
*  And the comic that inspires all this with the Marines and the flamethrowers is from
*  this early era where comics represent this kind of Americana.
*  Very famously, the first Captain America comic, it has him punching out Hitler on the cover
*  of it.
*  Then later, comics become much likelier to critique that kind of Americana, which seems
*  to me to happen with this character as time goes on.
*  And that feels true for movies too, to me, that we've moved in general from culture
*  that aims at a kind of consensus, sort of what everybody can agree on, to culture that
*  aims at a kind of critique.
*  Does that feel true to you?
*  Yes, it does.
*  And it comes hand in hand with the advancement of essentially computer graphics.
*  You don't have to go back very far to remember they couldn't make comic book movies until
*  CGI and computers made it possible.
*  When I was a kid, you don't have to go back very far.
*  George Reeves is Superman of the 1950s.
*  It was incredibly fake.
*  Maybe Michael Keaton's Batman and Christopher Reeves' Superman, even those were made with
*  wires and stuntmen and special effects that were still firmly rooted in the physical world.
*  CGI comes along and you can literally do anything that you can possibly imagine.
*  So don't you wonder sometimes, Ezra, how many Spider-Mans there can be that seem to
*  all exist in the same timeline or now different timelines, or how often Batman surprises somebody
*  in a club in Gotham City?
*  Someone always seems to say, who are you?
*  And it's like, have you seen all these other Batman movies for crying out loud?
*  They keep coming back around and around and around.
*  But the glory, I think, that comic books had for me was they existed pretty much in one
*  universe.
*  Each one had a very specific beginning, middle, and an end.
*  And there was a big difference, I think, between DC comics and Marvel comics, mostly because
*  of the storylines and the maturity of the Jack Kirby and the Stan Lee marvel that has,
*  I think, brought it through to the course of today.
*  There seems to be a never-ending appetite for more looks into what is, I guess, the
*  psychological drama that goes into these people that have incredible superpowers and what
*  did they do with them and how did they use them?
*  And along with the physical aspects of making a movie where absolutely anything can happen,
*  it also seems to be the case with the storylines, too.
*  They go into places that I can never, ever predict.
*  And I guess that's part of the attraction.
*  I want to hold for a second on why there's such an appetite for it, because I think there's
*  something interesting there, too.
*  But I want to go back to something here on this question of consensus versus critique,
*  because it feels to me like it occurs in the book in a few different ways.
*  So you have these old comics, and the book spends a bunch of time in sort of 50s and
*  America that are a little bit more about representing America as a kind of holistic, united front,
*  and then modern comics.
*  And I think a lot of modern movies are much more about critiquing that, right?
*  The movie that kicks the renaissance of comic movies off, Iron Man, with Robert Downey,
*  Jr., that's very much a critique of the military industrial state and one man's complicity
*  in it.
*  And the beginning of the book, not the part about comics, but the part that sets up the
*  plot almost entirely includes a pretty stirring attack on haters of movies.
*  But it read to be as a little bit more than that on a culture of being more interested
*  in why we don't like things and then why we do like them.
*  And it felt to me that you're playing quite a bit here with this question of why we've
*  moved from things that were meant to be in this consensus zone to things that were meant
*  to critique the idea that this consensus was a good zone ever in the first place.
*  I think it's because we have entered into a realm of cynicism seems to be much more
*  of a default position for an awful lot of cultural exchange.
*  Who's behind this?
*  What does it really mean?
*  What's really being said?
*  What's the PR version of what is being put forward to it?
*  What's the real nefarious purpose that is behind this?
*  Without a doubt, I think there is a sort of positivity that says, you know, as everybody
*  gets together and does their best, we can actually get together and figure something
*  out together.
*  And yet you take that concept and put it into a cynical position, which I do think is sort
*  of like the first stop that an awful lot of cultural exchange goes through is, number
*  one, well, why?
*  Will it really make a difference?
*  Who gains and who doesn't gain?
*  What does this really mean?
*  And I think that in a type of superhero movie, the common battle, I think, or the most approachable
*  aspect of the battle is not good versus evil.
*  It ends up being some other combination of, well, I'm not really well versed in all the
*  movies, but when you have somebody evil coming from some other dimension in order to conquer
*  the planet Earth, without a doubt, well, you know, that's evil and the good has to get
*  together and do it.
*  But even in the alliance of those, again, so this ends up being all sorts of conflicting
*  emotions and conflicting motivations.
*  Look, there's two types of cynicism.
*  One is righteous cynicism, you know, like follow the money, you know, that's a pretty
*  good brand of cynicism.
*  But there is the other type, which is just natural knee-jerk kind of, oh, come on, this
*  really, who do you think you are?
*  What are you even trying to do this for?
*  What are you trying to prove?
*  And I think that that represents in a lot of ways what people, the most fun thing in
*  order to search out oftentimes is, well, what's the conspiracy behind all of this?
*  The nature of what's going on in the smoke-filled rooms in the cabal of people trying to sway
*  their influence.
*  And I think that's represented in these huge, huge, huge movies in which we have conflicted
*  that seem to still be somehow those plucky misfits who still are able in order to learn
*  their lesson and come together.
*  I'm going to admit that this was never really a question about superheroes, but a question
*  thinly guised about you.
*  I can handle that.
*  Which is that one of the things I see when I look at your work in the books and the movies
*  is there is much more sentimentality.
*  And I mean that really truly as a compliment in an age of a lot of irony.
*  And that's also sort of true in the image.
*  It is either built around you or that you have built around yourself.
*  There is a sense of, yeah, maybe it's sincerity, positivity.
*  I'm not sure exactly what to call it, but it does feel a little counter-programmed today.
*  It feels like it harkens back and a lot of the source material harkens back to an idea
*  of a kind of America that was there once and probably still is, but has become a little
*  out of intellectual fashion.
*  So first I should just ask, does that resonate for you as an interpretation?
*  Yes, I think it does.
*  Look, I'm 66.
*  I was born in 1956 and I did not have the standard type of youth or home.
*  I was wandering around on my own pretty unsupervised from a very early age.
*  I was an eight-year-old kid that was riding the bus for hours on my own through Oakland,
*  California.
*  And looking back on it now, I can remember there were some malevolent characters out
*  there that I figured out pretty quickly were malevolent.
*  But I will tell you this, I came across many, many, many more people who seemed to be fair
*  and kind and honest.
*  Sometimes it was the old guys who ran the candy store that was down on the corner who
*  seemed to delight in having a bunch of kids around.
*  And that doesn't mean there wasn't some sleazy guys who were outside the candy store
*  saying, hey, I'll buy you some candy.
*  Would you like some candy?
*  I was aware from a very young age that there were folks out there to be avoided.
*  But I also was able to enjoy over and over again, I guess, sort of like the faith and
*  hope of people that didn't have to have any sort of faith or hope.
*  They didn't have to cotton to me.
*  We moved around a lot.
*  My mom got divorced very young and my dad was in the restaurant business and there were
*  three of us.
*  And I had a younger brother that didn't live with me and we were always on our own.
*  We were latchkey kids before, I didn't even know what a latch was.
*  But we made our own way and we made our own way and we seemed to be laughing more often
*  than we were terrified, even though we lived in some places that were actually quite lawless.
*  I had a teacher for two and a half years, Mrs. Castle, who just told me I was smart.
*  And she told me I was curious.
*  And she told me that I was good-natured.
*  And I didn't know I was any of those things, but I ended up understanding.
*  So I think I have always carried, I guess, some degree of those qualities to me because I don't
*  think I ever lived specifically in fear, despite the fact that I lived in an awful
*  lot of confusion all the time.
*  But again, I was lucky because there was always some combination of friends I made whose
*  parents were really cool, who were the semi-adoptive presence in my life for a number of years.
*  And along with the backdrop, too, that was going on, one of the themes that keeps coming back in
*  an awful lot of my work, I would admit, is the war, specifically World War II,
*  because every adult that I knew spoke of the war in capital letters.
*  Well, that was during the war.
*  That was before the war.
*  That was right after the war.
*  And they wore those years in their shoulders, in their body language.
*  They talked about it as it was the shared, common Rubicon that they all crossed.
*  And there was part of me that just thought, I wish I had something like that in my life.
*  And I didn't have anything like that until, you know, John F. Kennedy was assassinated when
*  I was in, what, second grade.
*  Then also at two, because I was in school and it was part of the Daily News and also the
*  Daily Science class, was the space program was going on.
*  And it was Mercury and it was Gemini and it was Apollo and they landed on the moon.
*  And talk about a Rubicon for all humanity, I mean, July 20, 1969, was everybody knew what they were
*  doing. They were all at home watching the moon landings all around the world.
*  And so I had these two superstructure themes that every adult was participating in.
*  And one is the war, which we won.
*  The other one was going to the moon, which was an evolutionary step in the history of all of humankind
*  that turned out to be possible.
*  But also the winning of a kind of war with the Soviet Union.
*  Well, and that was, yes, and that was always ongoing.
*  And, you know, I also very much remember thinking at the time, it can't be that simple.
*  What was going on at the Soviet Union was almost comical in its ineptness at the same time that it
*  was lethal in its contrariness to the human condition.
*  I remember thinking human beings don't live like that in the grand scheme of what all the stuff
*  that was communism.
*  Of course, after 69, we were very much involved in Vietnam that I knew this was not World War II.
*  I never went along goody two shoes with the concept of that was a just war.
*  And it was the same thing and all the lessons that we learned in the past, we can apply to the future.
*  Even I knew, hey, that was then, this is now.
*  And shouldn't we all know better?
*  I was aware at a pretty early age that, oh, I think we're being lied to here, guys.
*  I think they are lying to us.
*  And then on the top of that, I graduated from high school in 1974.
*  So we had the Watergate hearings and everything that was going on along with that.
*  So I was very much aware that America was in a brand of tumult right there.
*  But what I did not give into was an ongoing type of cynicism that said, it's all corrupt,
*  that it is all worthless.
*  Because even then, I was coming across people that were honest and forgiving and willing to
*  sit down and discuss the differences.
*  But I always was saying, well, where's the fractions in this?
*  What are the divisions in this?
*  Where is it going to be evident that there are folks who are out there constantly thinking of
*  what is the right thing to do here?
*  And also, dare I say it, what is the correct American thing to do here?
*  Because I was aware that just from basic educational aspects of it that,
*  here's what I knew, is that in the United States of America,
*  your parents could come into your room and say, we're moving.
*  You would load up everything in the car and you would move as many as 300 miles away,
*  start all over again.
*  And guess what?
*  There was a school that you would go to that wasn't all that difference in quality from the
*  school you had been going to.
*  And it was free and it was in walking distance.
*  And you were going to have some brand of a teacher that was going to evaluate you on their own
*  individual perspective of who you are.
*  And that, to me, that's what America was at its most basic.
*  So I want to pick up on America there because I've taken America as your great subject,
*  which isn't true for everybody in your line of work.
*  I don't think America is the subject of Tom Cruise or Will Smith or a bunch of other great actors.
*  And in particular, the stories America tells about itself.
*  You mentioned that a lot of your work has revolved around World War II.
*  You've also done amazing movies about Vietnam.
*  And I think World War II is sort of where America's idea of itself,
*  or in some ways one of its modern ideas of itself, cohered.
*  And Vietnam is where it also began to fall apart, like this huge counter narrative emerges
*  in a very central way.
*  It has always, of course, been there in other ways.
*  And that's true in your book, too.
*  I mean, it spans these wars.
*  The heroes come out of these wars in different ways.
*  The people in them are affected by the wars in different ways.
*  So how do you see the way that the stories America tells about itself and the stories
*  America now responds to changed in the tension between these two?
*  John Ligato It's because we've forgotten our history.
*  We no longer study it as, now that's what I would say.
*  And I'm only a layman historian.
*  I read history for pleasure.
*  But again and again, I think there is a through line to our history of the United States of
*  America that is both checkered and promising, without a doubt.
*  There's that line from days to confused, you know, they're letting out for the summer.
*  And just remember the Fourth of July is celebrating a bunch of rich, white slave owners who didn't
*  want to pay their taxes.
*  You know, there is a great truth that those were the guys who signed the Declaration of
*  Independence.
*  World War II, of course, we were still a segregated nation.
*  If you were black and American, unless you were part of the Tuskegee Airmen, and perhaps in some
*  parts of the Navy, you did not fight.
*  You served food, or you packed bags.
*  So we can't pretend that a perfect America went into all of these things in the past.
*  But an improving America did.
*  I go back again and again to the preamble of the Constitution of the United States that says in
*  order to form a more perfect union.
*  When I come across examples of that, I find it nearly heartbreaking that it's not taught,
*  or it's not spoken of in a way that is interesting.
*  When history is not taught, we do not have an appreciation for how far we have come as the
*  originators of an incredibly imperfect form of government, but just about the best that has ever
*  existed despite all of its imperfections, because it is governed from this concept
*  that we are always trying to create a more perfect union.
*  I've read John Steinbeck's Travels with Charlie.
*  Oh, I love that book.
*  That's a great book.
*  And there's a scene that I remember in reading that.
*  I'm going to say I read it in late junior high school.
*  I read it when I was 13 or 14 or 15 years old.
*  And he's driving along in his pickup truck with his camper on the back.
*  And Charlie, his dog, and he sees an old black man walking along a hot road.
*  And he stops.
*  John Steinbeck says, and said, sir, would you like a ride?
*  And the fellow gets in his cab, and they drive along.
*  And Steinbeck speaks about trying to reach out and connect with this fellow,
*  trying to communicate somehow that he understands the plight in the South.
*  This was the early, what, late 1950s, early 1960s when he made this.
*  So civil rights and the divisions between black and white America are at the forefront of
*  the daily news.
*  And he fails.
*  John Steinbeck fails.
*  What he's trying to do, he's trying to reach out to another American, probably maybe his same age,
*  but of a completely different race.
*  And he cannot make a connection.
*  Why?
*  Because the divide is too wide.
*  It's too huge.
*  It's written in capital letters, capital W for white and capital B for black.
*  And I remember reading that and being a little bit chilled because it was an example of how big
*  the divide was.
*  And it reminded me right there that we still have a long way to go if we are going to create
*  a more perfect union.
*  Vietnam, Vietnam was not a great war for the United States.
*  And you can go back any number of areas and say, here's all the reasons that we should never have
*  asked a bunch of young boys to go off and fight for our country as they were asked to and as they
*  did.
*  That doesn't subtract for a moment everything that they went through and everything that they
*  experienced.
*  And it certainly doesn't remove any of the baggage and tragedy that they carried with them for the
*  rest of their lives after that for a whole generation of people.
*  Vietnam is the Rubicon that was crossed.
*  And I think perhaps it could be that one of the degrees of cynicism that has existed ever since
*  is that just as when I was 5, 10, 11 years old and every adult that I knew was talking about the war
*  as in what they did from 1941 through 1945, 9, 10, 11 year old kids, they're hearing about the war,
*  but it's the one in Vietnam.
*  And the lessons that come from that is a very different sort of burden.
*  So
*  you're probably used to this being the case in this conversation by now, but this what's going to come
*  here is not going to be crisp, but I want to pull out something I think is interesting here.
*  My topic is American politics much more than it is American culture.
*  And what I take to be a very live question is this tension between appealing to the story
*  of the improving America, the good America, the better angels of America,
*  and living in the story of America's fractures, of its shortcomings, of its shortfalls.
*  And both the left and the right, I think, have their versions of this right now.
*  If you think about the way the rhetoric of a George W. Bush
*  differed from the rhetoric of Donald Trump, if you think of the way the rhetoric of Joe Biden
*  differs from the rhetoric of many on the left, that there is always this tension.
*  And I think it's often an elite and mass tension.
*  The intellectual culture tends to be much more focused on critique on what is wrong.
*  And mass culture tends to be very interested in sincerity on, politically speaking here,
*  patriotism. This gets called corny. You have unbelievable amounts of love for the play Hamilton,
*  and there's kind of an elite backlash to it. And this just comes on again and again.
*  And one reason I'm having this conversation with you is that I actually see you as somebody who
*  has for a long time been exploring the boundaries of that kind of mass interest in the sincere.
*  You were Mr. Rogers a few years ago. You were Captain Sully. You've often gravitated around
*  these places where even now America's figures it can agree on. Even now America's figures,
*  whom a lot of people find beautiful or inspiring because they seem to somehow not be
*  inside the divisions. And Rogers is maybe a good example of this and a particular example of this.
*  He's become almost canonized in the past couple of years. And when I watched that movie,
*  it had much more dark elements than I was expecting in it. So I'm curious about this
*  attraction for you. I mean, is this a conscious thing for you that you are looking for what people
*  can actually agree on at a time when the culture seems to have turned towards emphasizing what we
*  cannot? I don't take any of these gigs unless there's something about it that absolutely
*  fascinates me. And I said, well, that hasn't been explored. There's something that is deeply rooted
*  that is going to show something else. And I have played a number of people who I had to talk to
*  before I made the movie about them. Jim Lovell on Apollo 13, Charlie Wilson, Charlie Wilson's War,
*  Richard Phillips on Captain Phillips, Chesley Sullenberger. And I met all sorts of people who
*  knew Fred Rogers extraordinarily well. And out of there comes the chance to get down to a sort of
*  root philosophy about them. Or, well, let me put it this way. I think the best versions of making
*  what I call nonfiction entertainment is behavior and the procedure that illuminates the grand
*  motivations of who they are. And I'll just give you this about Fred Rogers. I don't know if you
*  know this, but Fred Rogers was an ordained minister. He was the Reverend of Fred Rogers.
*  And he went to his church and said, I do not want to have a church. I want my church to be
*  children's television. And television was so new, they kind of said, huh, what? How do you do that?
*  No, that's not how this works. And he ended up explaining what he could do with his theological
*  background that then became the Mr. Rogers neighborhood that we're familiar with. And
*  Mr. Rogers never used the word God in any of his broadcasts. He never taught about heaven or hell.
*  He never talked about the Ten Commandments or the apostles. He never brought up the Bible.
*  What he did was he tended to the fears and the understandings of his congregation. And his
*  congregation was made up of three and four-year-old kids who were afraid of being sucked down the
*  toilet if they fell into it while it was being flushed. Well, you start with that, and then you
*  just get to this kind of place where after that, I mean, even Fred's wife would just say, well, hey,
*  well, Tom, Fred was a complicated guy and life is just one damn thing after another, isn't it?
*  And you take that into account and then you realize, well, that's the case with all of these
*  guys that I've played, Charlie Wilson and certainly Richard Phillips and certainly Sully, who on one
*  hand did something magnificent in saving the lives of every single person that was on that plane.
*  He knew that if anybody had drowned, that he would be blamed. What I see, I guess, in all of these
*  guys is some form of will-breaking pressure that they do not show. And in some cases, the movie is
*  not interested in showing, but as the actor playing all those guys, I have written about
*  that back-breaking pressure, that will-defeating, possible demoralization. Did they do the right
*  thing? Are they doing their job right? Are they endangering anybody? And that's what I bring to
*  the process well before we end up shooting. And because it's nonfiction, because it is based on
*  real people in real circumstances, even though, as I said to all these guys, I'm going to say things
*  you never said, be places you never were and do things you never did. Inside that still has to be
*  sort of the molecular DNA of that all-encompassing truth of why they do what they do for a living
*  or in the subject of the movie, along with how they did it. And that ends up being behavior and
*  procedure. And to me as an actor and as a guy who reads history, and of course now it's trying to
*  write something that actually reflects the world as I know it, that's job number one, man. There's
*  nothing more fascinating to me than that. The moment in that movie that sticks with me the most
*  is when the journalist asks Mr. Rogers wife about how Fred Rogers manages to be so damn nice all
*  the time. And she says, he works at it all the time. It's a practice. I'm curious about this on
*  two levels. One, what you learned from reading about studying that side of him, right? The swimming,
*  the praying, the things that kept him grounded in himself. But two, I have to imagine, and I feel
*  like it was threaded through the answer you just gave me that you've got a reputation for being a
*  nice guy. You get called America's dad. I mean, there's a certain amount of backbreaking pressure,
*  I'm sure in feeling like there is this public Tom Hanks who cannot be betrayed. I'm curious
*  what practices you took from Rogers or what practices you have yourself to maintain groundedness
*  in that. Well, it does require a certain degree of work, but there also has to be with it, I think,
*  a sense of the value to it. I mean, it's valuable, I think, to the self. What do we all want to be,
*  I think we all want to be compassionate, right? I think we all want to be both enlightening and
*  enlightened by all that we go through and all that we discover and all that we witness.
*  And I think also, I think we want to both experience joy and if there's a way in order
*  to create it, I think we all want to be able to create joy because I've sort of woken up every
*  morning from being a socially conscious human being of some degree of seeking joy. But that
*  doesn't mean the world is always wonderful because enlightenment comes from bitter compromise,
*  enlightenment comes from tragedy, enlightenment comes by way of conquering something that,
*  if left to service, is going to somehow destroy you. Compassion, likewise, we want to both be able to
*  feel the compassion of others, but what good is that if we don't have compassion for other people,
*  including those that we don't know? I mean, the story told about John Steinbeck picking up that
*  old black man in the South, they had compassion for him, but what enlightenment did he get from
*  that exchange? He got from that the divide is so great that it can't be penetrated in the length
*  of a 20-minute lift into town. I do understand the purchase and sort of like contract I have
*  with the last three generations of moviegoers because my career happened to coincide with
*  the invention of the VHS tape cassette. So I have babysat an awful lot of kids
*  who were left at home in order to watch any number of movies while mom and dad went out.
*  And now, of course, we live in a circumstance where you can see anything you want to anytime
*  you want to. So I know that, you know, I've been in an awful lot of people's living rooms, and even
*  the stuff that is probably more obtuse and not exactly the type of everybody's movie cues,
*  I can't tell you how often somebody comes up to me and says, I was in a hotel room, and I was in,
*  you know, Dalhart, Texas, and I ended up watching that movie that you made in Saudi Arabia. What
*  was that about? And then we could talk about this movie I made called Hologram for the King and
*  everything that it stood for. So I know what that is, and I don't discount it for a minute,
*  but at the same time, you have to walk this fine line, and I think perhaps Mr. Rogers did,
*  and I'm going to think that also Sully did and also Richard Phillips is, you can't let anybody
*  take advantage of that good nature. And there are people out there that are hell-bent on doing that
*  very thing to take advantage of that good nature or to assume that somehow you're a push over or
*  somehow assume that it's not real, that it doesn't really count, that it's not really who you are,
*  that you're putting on some performance. And I'm not going to look, without a doubt,
*  the vast majority of press junk that anybody does in order to promote movies, that's as much
*  a performance as the one you give in the movie. You have to go off and you do that kind of stuff.
*  But that's part of the, everybody I think understands it's part of the exchange as well.
*  But then what's the value of going to be, look, I try to go to bed at night with as little
*  self-loathing as possible. And what I've learned over the course since I was born in 1956, Asra,
*  what I've learned is that that requires an awful lot of work at being authentic with people,
*  to the degree that you owe them your authenticity. And an awful lot of people out there that I've come
*  across are worthy of sort of like 100% of how I understand my job and how I understand what I've
*  contributed to something. Because I have those same people that have contributed to me, you know.
*  Somewhere between James Brown and Chrissy Hynde and Paul McCartney, I have people that I wouldn't
*  know what to say to them if I met them, because I would just be foaming all over them saying,
*  I can't, what you meant to me when I was growing up. It'd be the same exact way.
*  And to get from them, which I have on occasion, a kind of a nod and an understanding and an
*  appreciation for what that is, they put on clinics on how to be authentic as well and understand that
*  it's a shared moment as opposed to a performed one. And what have you learned from that? When
*  somebody comes up to you and you mean something to them and you've never met them, how do you help them
*  have the moment they want from you that they don't know how to get?
*  I have a friend that went off, actually, I think he wrote about it in his book, Matthew McConaughey.
*  He told a story about being at this juncture in his life, and I hope it's in the book, otherwise
*  I'm dropping too big of a name, in which case, Matthew, I apologize. But he ended up seeking out
*  a monk, right, in a monastery somewhere that he heard was this great spiritual guide. And I've
*  since talked to other guys who have talked to Buddhist monks and what have you. And what he did
*  was he poured out his life and all of his struggles to this guy for the better part of five hours.
*  They just walked and talked, and they just talked and talked, and everything about Matthew's life
*  came out, all of his struggles, all of his struggles, all of his difficulties, all of the
*  tests that he felt as though he failed and whatnot, and where he was now, and it was all over.
*  And the monk said this to him,
*  me too. Which is, that's the thing to say, because when someone is coming up to you,
*  what they're saying is, yeah, I understand. Yeah, me too. Yeah. On one hand, you say,
*  I'm glad you liked it. I'm glad you saw it. I'm glad it spoke to you. But what they're really
*  weighing in with, what we're really trusting you with is the weight of what that did for them
*  at that time. And we all have versions of that weight that was measured and lifted by some piece
*  of art, some piece of, you get to know somebody on a plane and you have a conversation with them,
*  and then you land and you never see them again, but you never forget somehow that conversation
*  you had with somebody on a plane, because it is a shared board. And that old saying, a problem
*  shared is a problem halved. When someone comes up to me and they're not asking for a selfie,
*  they're not trying to have a moment of exchange. I was once walking through the same door as Mickey
*  Mantle was. I was not about to say anything to Mickey Mantle. I just kind of looked at him,
*  and that was all that was required. But when someone invests a moment in time with me to say,
*  hey, that really touched me or that really helped me or better yet, hey, I've never
*  forgot seeing that movie that you were in. I think what I try to say is, I know that feeling.
*  I know what that means. And ain't you cool? And then sometimes I say, slap me five, and then we
*  get on with it. We go our separate ways. You clearly have a hell of a work ethic.
*  You've made more movies than I can count. You've done, written the past couple of years,
*  two fiction books that are, you put them together, almost a thousand pages of Tom Hanks' writing.
*  What role does rest, does pleasure, does play hold in your life or in your work?
*  Oh, I have vast amounts of time off where I don't do anything. I will say that I probably have
*  attention deficit disorder based on knowing what time it was by what was on TV from a very early
*  age. And there was always, yeah, look, there's a commercial on about every 17 minutes. So I take a
*  break every seven minutes. But the concentrated work that I do in my day job as an actor is
*  extremely focused. And let me also say finite. It goes on for a certain point and then is done.
*  And when that is done, then I do nothing for weeks, months at a time. But I'm always clouded
*  with ongoing ideas. So I think then that's a good place to end always our final question.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  Three books would be Bear Town by Fredrik Bachmann. It's the first in a trilogy about
*  youth hockey club in a small town in Sweden. I'm looking forward to reading the next two,
*  knowing a little bit about Sweden and enough about hockey to be able to enjoy it.
*  The Swerve by Stephen Greenblatt, How the Modern World Began. It's about the discovery in 1417
*  of what had been a long lost Latin book or codex of Lucretius that in 1417 more or less gave way
*  to modern thinking and the advent of the Renaissance. And Trust by Hernan Diaz,
*  which is a fabulous book, the structure of which is just gorgeous and tells an awful
*  lot about what I'd like to think of as nonfiction entertainment by way of a novel, gorgeous books.
*  Tom Hanks, thank you very much.
*  Well, thank you. Ezra Klein, I enjoyed talking to you.
