# This Conservative Thinks America’s Institutions ‘Earned’ Their Distrust
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [August 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfqZr7SSs-8)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  Hey, it is Ezra.
*  I am on book leave, but this week taking a turn at the mic is Jane Costin.
*  She's a Times opinion writer.
*  She has done years of work covering modern republicanism, conservatism, the populist
*  right and all of the schisms and fractures within.
*  It's a topic we've been trying to do more work on.
*  So I was grateful she's willing to come on the show and do some conversations around
*  it.
*  Enjoy.
*  In 1964, 73% of Republicans said they trusted the federal government to do the right thing
*  – almost always or most of the time.
*  Today, that number is down to 9%.
*  And it's not just the government.
*  You can see that same basic trend for the media, for public schools, for universities.
*  You can't understand the modern republican party without understanding this complete
*  collapse in trust in mainstream institutions.
*  Which is why I was interested in having a conversation with Mary Catherine Hamm.
*  Hamm is a fourth generation journalist and conservative writer who has appeared on CNN,
*  Fox News, and ABC News.
*  And a core theme of her work is the way that American institutions, from the CDC to the
*  Department of Education to the mainstream media, have failed again and again to serve
*  Americans.
*  Hamm and I disagree on a lot.
*  I'm old enough to recall the events that led up to the Iraq War, and old enough to
*  have read a fair amount about FBI surveillance of dissidents and the ways in which so-called
*  objective reporters called LGBT people deviance.
*  So it is slightly amusing to me that Republicans have just now decided that the federal government
*  is worthy of distrust.
*  But I think hers is a perspective that's worth hearing out.
*  First, because there's some real truth to it.
*  But also because it's a perspective that has become dominant on the American right
*  today.
*  As always, you can email the show with your thoughts and guest recommendations at
*  Mary Katherine Hamm, welcome to the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Thank you so much for having me.
*  So you've written that this country so desperately needs a reliable narrator and every major
*  institution and figure just refuses to be one.
*  That is the overall theme of a lot of your work is a growing distrust or the state of
*  distrust largely from conservatives in American institutions.
*  Why do you think that's happened?
*  In large part because the institutions deserve it.
*  I am at heart was raised in ink stained wretch.
*  I'm a fourth generation newspaper journalist.
*  My great grandfather started the illustrious newspaper in beautiful pits, Georgia.
*  And then his son was a writer for that paper.
*  And then my dad was a newspaper editor and now me.
*  And I worked in newspapers before they fell off a cliff in the mid 2000s.
*  So my take on media is often, help me help you.
*  I want this to be better.
*  I want to have a fourth estate that is strong that people can believe.
*  And I feel like far too often and frankly, during the covid era in some pretty obviously
*  disturbing ways, we got past sort of basic bias or not knowing what the other side believed
*  and into actual suppression.
*  And that understandably makes people turned off.
*  Right. That understandably is a trust issue.
*  And I've spoken about it for years that particularly in media, there's a lack of introspection.
*  Despite the fact that trust numbers are so low and we should be very concerned about
*  that as an industry, there tends to be a tendency to put it on the audience like, gosh, they're
*  just not receiving us correctly.
*  And it's like, well, maybe we could think about some of the things that we've done that
*  would make them not receive us well.
*  You've talked about the 2016 election as a turning point for you in terms of media trust.
*  I think every major publication publish some sort of what happened?
*  Usually with like that headline and that kind of vocal effect.
*  Five thirty eight did a version.
*  The Times did a version.
*  The Washington Post did a version.
*  Everybody did a what did we do wrong?
*  What happened story?
*  But it's clear that that wasn't sufficient for you.
*  And I think for a lot of people, why?
*  OK, so I do appreciate an attempt to piece this together.
*  And I think there were some attempts made.
*  They were sort of short lived.
*  And I think after the attempt is made, there's people fall back into the habit of like, we're
*  just going to see this the way we see it.
*  And the concern I had was not that Trump didn't do bad things.
*  I was opposed to him the entirety of 2016.
*  I'm on CNN talking about it.
*  But it was that because you can imagine that this person you don't like did a terrible
*  thing, does not mean that we have the facts to support that.
*  And I don't want to get there.
*  And I also don't want to disrespect the people who voted for him and write them off, even
*  though I didn't, because that's a large part of the country.
*  And it's a large part of the country that you need to have trust with.
*  The other thing about sort of calling elections and look, I have no pristine record in this
*  case.
*  But I do think when the entire industry gets something so wrong, which is seeing Donald
*  Trump coming.
*  Now, to be fair, Donald Trump didn't see himself winning.
*  That was a surprise to him.
*  However, I thought, man, it is a problem if we all put our TV dresses and our ties on
*  the next day and tell everybody, well, here we are to just analyze again.
*  Well, you just really, really messed up.
*  If you don't own up to that in that moment, I think people go, oh, great, they're just
*  putting on their act again, and they're not being trustworthy.
*  So I've always thought that the idea of quote unquote, trusting media seems misplaced to
*  me.
*  I've noticed that a lot of the people who are like very angry at the New York Times
*  still have New York Times bestselling writer in their Twitter bio.
*  There's really a sense of like, it's an authority when we want it to be and it's not an authority
*  when we're mad at it.
*  For another thing, a lot of the people who will say that they distrust media, they trust
*  somebody, should they?
*  To my mind, what I end up doing, and this is something that I think the former Twitter,
*  the artist formerly known as Twitter, was actually good for is that when I joined Twitter
*  many, many years ago, too many, you could cultivate this personally tailored stream
*  of people you trust.
*  Now that of course means on left and right that often you end up with a stream of people,
*  people who agree with you.
*  I attempt very proactively to fill my feed with people I do not agree with.
*  I attempt to read their stuff in good faith and disagree in good faith.
*  I grew up in an all liberal town.
*  If I had not been able to disagree in good faith, my entire life I would have had no
*  one to talk to.
*  And so that's an important part of how I think you can gain perspective on news.
*  I don't pick outlets.
*  I generally pick reporters or I pick commentators who I feel like are dealing with me on the
*  will tell me stuff that is against perhaps the prevailing narrative because that takes
*  some courage.
*  That to me is one of the parts of new media that is good and can be exhausting is that
*  you are forming your own sort of newsroom personally and then to challenge yourself
*  and make sure that newsroom is not everyone who agrees with you.
*  Because I say this all the time.
*  I speak on college campuses as the one weirdo right winger they invite and I say, be the
*  weirdo in the room.
*  It's hard, but rooms need weirdos because they need their ideas tested.
*  And I attempt to have a little bit of backbone to occasionally be that weirdo.
*  Right.
*  There's been this constant discussion.
*  You know, a lot of my work has focused on covering conservatism in the age of Trump
*  and a lot of the criticism I've gotten is that either I am giving cover to the worst
*  elements of some of American society by trying to make sense of it and trying to put it into
*  some sort of conservative parlance or putting it into context.
*  Or I'm not being nice enough to very nice conservatives and this is how we got Trump.
*  Which I've always thought to be such a funny argument that like things were awful and that's
*  why we had to get this guy we like.
*  Like that's not how that works.
*  But a lot of publications are thinking about how do you cover or to use the term platform,
*  which I actually kind of hate because that kind of implies that you are just like, you
*  pick somebody up and you're like, here you go.
*  I think that conservatives might remember in 2020 NPR did an interview with someone
*  who wrote a book about how riots essentially were good and that riots were a good idea.
*  And this was this interview with this person who had written this book.
*  And I think some of the coverage of that book that I saw in Right Leaning Outlets was essentially
*  one, how dare this person write this book?
*  Two, how did this person's book get covered in NPR?
*  And three, how dare this person's book and ideas get engaged with on NPR and any outlet?
*  And so I'm curious how you think about this problem of one, what does it even mean to
*  platform?
*  Are we saying that this idea is good or bad, even if you get to see it?
*  Two, how do you engage with those ideas?
*  Somewhat you know, extreme ideas or extreme again, take your pick of what that means with
*  context and pushback while making it readable, perceivable.
*  How do you think about that?
*  Yeah.
*  So on the platforming question, I'm in favor of just like really wide latitude on the ideas
*  that adults can engage with.
*  Now, I think the argument on the NPR coverage of that book is that, okay, you have a book
*  that's explicitly saying writing can be great.
*  And the idea that a similarly extreme take on the right would get similar coverage in
*  the same outlet, I think is on its face obvious that that would not happen.
*  Right.
*  So I think a lot of it comes from that.
*  Like, this is legitimized while we are pathologized.
*  You can engage with this stuff without maybe doing either of those things.
*  So I think like a wide latitude is good.
*  When it comes to platforming Trump, it's like, well, he's the by a vast lead leading candidate
*  for one of the major parties.
*  So I disagreed with the idea that Licht had gone wrong in having him in this town hall.
*  Chris Licht, formerly of CNN, had the Trump town hall.
*  The interlocutor was Caitlin Collins.
*  Put her up there, asked some tough questions.
*  Now, would I have done it slightly differently?
*  I think he was very brazen about, oh, yeah, it is a super pro Trump crowd.
*  I would have maybe had some more ground rules for that, which I think would have made it
*  a better situation.
*  So some of it is just reading the room.
*  However, I think you can engage with plenty of ideas and critique them without denigrating
*  entire parts of the population who might also be engaging with those ideas.
*  I also hate the idea on TV or Twitter or whatever it is, this happened a lot during the Trump
*  years.
*  But I think you can engage in providing context and saying, OK, well, how big is this Trump
*  offense?
*  Let's compare it to things we've seen in the past.
*  That is treated as Trump boosting.
*  I actually think the context is bringing us closer to understanding this issue than further
*  away.
*  So I don't like the idea that engaging in walking through each of these things and not
*  imagining your Trump narrative as opposed to really comparing it to history, that that's
*  off limits, that that makes you some kind of sellout because I think you're actually
*  informing people.
*  So we've seen this conversation more recently with Democratic presidential candidate Robert
*  F. Kennedy Jr. and his views generally centering on vaccines, but also ranging from believing
*  that the Koch brothers should be sent to prison to something about COVID as a bio-weapon.
*  I think that there have been a lot of good arguments about how his views are shared by
*  some people and his views deserve to be heard and then contested.
*  But I'm curious as to your thoughts as to, I wrote down crackpottery, which I've decided
*  now I really like that as a noun, but each of us, and I think we kind of have a general
*  consensus as to the crackpottery, we're like, we'll listen to this and the crackpottery
*  we're like, no, this isn't acceptable.
*  Out and out Holocaust denial, for example.
*  So in a country as broad as ours and with media whose incentives are there because it's
*  grabby and interesting and the incentives to cover him, especially for conservatives
*  who don't like Joe Biden very much are very much there.
*  But I am interested in how you think about like anti-vaccine views we can engage with,
*  Holocaust denial can't engage with.
*  How do we think about whose crackpottery we listen to and engage with and again, challenge
*  to be clear and who's are we like, nope, that's anathema.
*  I think it's sliding scale.
*  I would like the parameters to be like way out here on the left and right just because
*  I'm pretty crackpotty myself on that, just on the idea of airing these things.
*  So I want the parameters to be wide.
*  I also think what RFK Jr. is tapping into, well, he's covered one because like he's a
*  he's getting not a small amount of percentage in this non-primary race that's sort of happening
*  under the radar.
*  He's getting equivalent to many and more percentage points than many of the GOP contenders against
*  Trump, right?
*  So I think that's interesting because there's a market that's being served here.
*  Now a lot of coverage has attempted to sort of pin him on the right.
*  Like he's a man of the right.
*  I'm like, well, he's literally a Kennedy running in the Democratic primary.
*  So I'm not sure about that.
*  But I think what people miss in trying to make him a man of the right is that there's
*  a real coming together of the right and left.
*  Now some of it is crackpottery, but in this area of massive distrust and that there's
*  a real reason for it.
*  I think Michelle Goldberg nailed it in her column about him.
*  He is the candidate of the distrustful and those folks, because they have been lied to
*  on other things, are going to be inclined to believe they're not hearing the truth on
*  many things and some of the things they really are, right?
*  This is the, I'm sure it's probably universal, but it feels very much the problem of our
*  time is parsing.
*  When I think I'm getting the straight story from institutions, from media and telling
*  people, nah, nah, nah, you're, you're conspiracizing about this thing.
*  Except then that thing like sort of ends up being true and I have to make a culpa on that
*  and be like, I was trying to be reasonable, but you actually were correct about this when
*  they were hiding the ball on this.
*  So we have a real problem with that and it does create grounds for more conspiracy theories.
*  Right.
*  We talk about how there's this rising distrust, but that seems to me to rely on a halcyon
*  story of American institutions, including the media, a version in which there used to
*  be a limited number of media institutions and they would all kind of generally agree
*  on what got covered and what didn't get covered.
*  And you see again and again how stories that were impactful, you know, if you go back through
*  the New York Times archives and just look for the word homosexuality, how stories that
*  were particularly impactful in the lives of minorities from African Americans to LGBT
*  people were just not covered or covered them as if they were speaking for a general audience
*  that thought they were weird and gross and should be isolated.
*  And so the idea of distrusting major institutions, including the media, seems to be just kind
*  of how we should generally feel.
*  You know, that old story for journalists that if your mother tells you that she loves you,
*  you should like double check.
*  Should that just be how we think about institutions?
*  Yes, and I'll bring you a moment of unity from the CNN set over those Trump years.
*  But Angela Rye and I used to be on together.
*  She's certainly a left leaning commentator, I would say quite liberal.
*  We're far apart on issues, but we are not far apart on distrust of institutions.
*  And so when there was a widespread compulsion to just say like the intelligence community
*  and the FBI are full of unassailable public servants doing what we need them to do.
*  And how dare you try to question the work that they're doing.
*  Angela and I would look at each other and be like, I mean, is this the FBI that spied on Martin Luther King?
*  That's the one we're talking about.
*  And this is where I think, again, the historical context can be helpful to people when you're
*  talking about this instead of Angela Rye's no Trump booster by a long shot, but she has a healthy distrust
*  of an institution that has earned that distrust.
*  I think one of the problems with media is it does appear to me and it does appear accelerated
*  in the past 10 years or so.
*  When one side is in charge of the institutions, there is far less skepticism.
*  I would like there to be tons of skepticism all the time.
*  I struggle with how not to tip into cynicism, but I am largely skeptical of all government endeavors.
*  And they have the power, unlike any other institution, to violently withhold your freedom.
*  So I think that's important.
*  It's important to ask questions of them.
*  And if my side is in charge, that doesn't mean that things are going swimmingly.
*  I don't want to go back to a time when there were three newscasts and that all the facts came from those people.
*  I love that the internet gives us primary coverage, primary documents that you can go
*  back and read yourself that are not filtered through someone else.
*  Now, you're going to build your own filters.
*  And sometimes those filters are going to be faulty and you need to test yourself on that.
*  But you can find more primary information than we've ever had access to in the past
*  from government, from candidates, from events that you were not at.
*  And I think that that's important and valuable.
*  And I think perhaps people are more distrustful because they see more things.
*  There's more available to them to parse these things.
*  And then sometimes I think they're wrong, but they're seeing more of the picture sometimes
*  and seeing what was kept from them, just as other populations had seen that earlier.
*  So we've been talking about institutions that are made up of a lot of actors and many complex
*  organizations talking about the media.
*  How do you think about rebuilding an institution, even if you can say the media is an institution,
*  where there's no central governing body that drives the media?
*  Look, it is all distributed and it is all changing.
*  This is not to get too existential about it, but we talk about these institutions as if
*  they have been in stasis at any particular time.
*  Right. They have been changing with administrations.
*  They have been changing with cultural winds.
*  They have been changing with economic forces for decades.
*  I mean, I watched newspapers falling off the ledge.
*  That happened right when I was in them in 2004 or 2005 and happened to move to sort
*  of a new media position and was like, hey, look at that.
*  But these things have been changing for a long time.
*  I do not know how you institute, like for instance, a cultural understanding that raucous
*  debate and free speech is good, which I think should be the default position of journalists.
*  Once that cultural understanding is gone, particularly in elite universities from where
*  many journalists are coming, I don't know how you reinstitute that.
*  You know, it would be nice.
*  So when you come into an organization that is sensibly a practitioner of free speech,
*  maybe there's an onboarding that includes some talk of that and why it's important,
*  because they're not getting it often in college.
*  In the context of that, you can talk about the problems that we must grapple with while
*  we're having that conversation.
*  Right.
*  But I do think there's plenty of money spent on onboarding about many, many, many other
*  And perhaps that should be one of them that is part of the discussion in your training
*  when you come to a new journalistic endeavor.
*  I want to shift the conversation to talk about schools.
*  That's an issue that you've talked a lot about and an issue on which you see Republicans
*  really voicing a lot of distrust in schools and education.
*  But I want to put that in a little bit of broader context, because that's not new.
*  Contrary to what people may believe, the Department of Education was not birthed by George Washington.
*  The Department of Education was established under the Carter administration.
*  And since time immemorial, and that means 1980, there's been a lot of talk from Republicans
*  about wanting to shut down the Department of Education.
*  We've heard that again from Republican candidates.
*  Governor Ronda Santa said that this week.
*  You've heard that from other candidates.
*  But this isn't new.
*  Since 1980, you saw that in 1995, there was a real effort to shut down the Department of
*  Education.
*  Why that distrust historically and why that distrust recently?
*  Well, one, and this does not apply to the entire GOP primary voter population, because
*  many of them are not ideological.
*  But there is an ideological bent toward, I mean, I'm like very libertarian on some on
*  many things.
*  And if I had my druthers would live in a world where there were far fewer federal agencies,
*  just period.
*  Because I think if the federal government were less expansive, and took fewer experts
*  to run each individual thing, it might actually do things better.
*  That's part of it.
*  There is a distrust among center-right folks of orders coming from the federal government
*  all the way down.
*  And that that is, in the case of education, especially, and I think you saw some of this
*  on the left with No Child Left Behind, that these things can't be tailored to schools
*  that need to do different things, right?
*  I have been open to that idea.
*  My mother was a teacher.
*  I've seen it, right?
*  So there's some of that.
*  The new enthusiasm, passion for the distrust of these institutions from school boards on
*  up comes from extended closures during COVID.
*  Now, I was sort of steeped in this because I was in an area that schools closed for more
*  than a year.
*  And the fight to get them open was pitched, to say the least.
*  A lot of parents, not right-leaning parents, this is Northern Virginia, learned for the
*  first time and were genuinely surprised.
*  And I was surprised as a skeptic of government in general that the school board was adversarial
*  to many parents just asking for their kids to be in school.
*  And the treatment was bad to the point of like one of my friends who was an activist
*  on this being told that she just wanted her brunches back.
*  You saw this in various school boards that, hey, do you want your kid dead or do you want
*  them educated?
*  That was an actual school board member in Alexandria, Virginia who said, that is paraphrased,
*  that it is not unfaithful to the spirit of that quote.
*  And so a lot of people who were very invested in that fight, many of them not ideological,
*  many of them not right-leaning, started noticing more things that their school board was doing
*  or their school was doing or got more angry at their schools for treating them the way
*  that they treated them during this fight.
*  And I think a lot of them who had no opinion on say teachers unions before or had a vaguely
*  positive vision of teachers unions got pretty upset with them, particularly a place like
*  Virginia where teachers were put at the front of the line and then were then told everybody
*  no, no, we're not going to go back.
*  They were put at the front of line for vaccines.
*  The ask was let's get back in school.
*  The answer was no.
*  So this made people very upset.
*  And I have been sort of mystified during this entire debate by the fact that many on the
*  left believed that there would not be a large consequence for having closed a daily part
*  of sort of given public facility, a service that you pay taxes for that you know is going
*  to be there.
*  And it might not be perfect.
*  It might not even be good in some cases, but the doors are going to open.
*  And then the answer was they're not going to open.
*  You're fine.
*  Shut your mouths.
*  And that wasn't the truth.
*  The kids weren't fine.
*  Some of them did fine.
*  I don't want to paint with a too broad a brush.
*  But of course, there was a loss of trust there.
*  Of course, Democrats in some polls lost 20 points generational advantage on the issue
*  of education.
*  And they deserved to because this was a disservice.
*  The COVID death toll in 2021 was higher than in 2020.
*  It feels obvious in hindsight that schools should have been open.
*  But again, the start of the 2020-2021 school year, we were not even remotely out of the
*  woods and especially what we knew at the time is different.
*  Does it feel like there was a good reason at all to keep school doors closed to you?
*  Okay, so I will give you the end of 2020 school year.
*  At that time, I was like, oh gosh, that's seem weird.
*  Maybe we should take extreme measures and we did not know yet how it affected children.
*  I get that.
*  So even with some shutdown things, I was a little too acquiescent to those in my mind.
*  Right?
*  Well, this does seem like a once in a lifetime event for a little while.
*  But I think if you look back at the data and some of the reporting at the time, you will
*  see I believe it was an NPR report by Anya Kamenetz.
*  I think it was a June report on kids of essential workers who were therefore exposed more than
*  other kids were being taken care of at YMCAs and other facilities so that their parents
*  could work and the ways that they figured out to make that work.
*  And the early data from that, as we had seen from early data from Denmark or Sweden, was
*  that, in fact, it wasn't passing from these kids to these caretakers, that it wasn't creating
*  these huge outbreaks.
*  And I think had there been, as there was in some red states, as there was among private
*  schools, a bent toward the idea of opening as opposed to stuck on the closing, you would
*  have modulated fairly quickly.
*  You've written that students will need creative solutions to come back from this damage.
*  They deserve better than power consolidated in the hands of those who failed them, just
*  to your point.
*  Moving forward, what ideas have you come across that are interesting to you?
*  Yeah, so I do think that in many cases, workplaces and schools is another area.
*  We have earned flexibility from this terrible situation that COVID gave us.
*  And that in some cases, flexibility can give you the creative solutions.
*  Often parents created those for themselves with pods or with homeschooling.
*  There's data all over the place that homeschooling has gone up exponentially, particularly in
*  minority communities who adopted it.
*  And so I think ways to give them resources, Virginia is a place where there's now a credit
*  to pay for the intensive tutoring that your kid might need after the schools were closed
*  for so long.
*  I think those are ways that we can help.
*  I'm not averse to spending on that, especially when COVID spending has already gone out the
*  door and exists.
*  But frankly, there's not a lot of, there's not a magic bullet, I think is my concern,
*  that we are so behind the ball that it gets pretty daunting.
*  One of the challenges you face in school curriculum in general, whether it's about closures or
*  whether it's about arguments over what children are taught when, is that this will always
*  be hinged on the most motivated people getting involved.
*  But you also need to consider the interests of all children, including the children who
*  have parents who aren't involved at all.
*  You mentioned increasing numbers of people homeschooling.
*  There's been a lot of talk about the rise of charter schools and advocacy for private
*  school vouchers.
*  You've seen that system in a bunch of states.
*  But again, those systems often will leave behind students who are already always left
*  behind.
*  Students who aren't able to navigate applying for charter schools or private schools themselves,
*  students who might be in foster care.
*  My concern is always that when you are relying on parents being super motivated, you know
*  that there is a swath of people who are parents in legal terms, but may not be involved in
*  their children's lives much at all.
*  The point of having a public entity like the Department of Education, and like the concept
*  of public education in general, is that you care about the kids when even their own parents
*  don't.
*  If you have any experience or have worked with kids who are in the juvenile justice
*  system or in foster care, or children who have suffered abuse and often neglect for
*  whom school is where they will get fed, school is where someone will notice if they are there,
*  school is where someone will see that you have bruises or you are wearing the same clothes
*  for days and days and days.
*  And these are all things that happen to kids who are in the system and out of the system.
*  I really worry about how a focus on an increasing privatization of schooling that again is driven
*  by parents who care a lot about their kids and understandably are more concerned about
*  their kids than the kids of just some dude.
*  I get that.
*  I totally do.
*  But how do you think about this problem of the kids who are already getting left behind?
*  How do we make sure they aren't more so?
*  Is that even possible?
*  Okay.
*  So the idea is that a public entity and a public school system cares about everyone's
*  kids, even the kids that their own parents aren't caring about them, the people who the
*  rest of society doesn't see and doesn't take care of.
*  We tested that notion.
*  In many cases, it wasn't true.
*  It was not true.
*  They had a year to show that it was true.
*  18 months in some cases.
*  That is such a giant failure of that concept that understandably people wonder, why am
*  I dealing with you?
*  Why are you the entity that we're asking to care about these kids when you actively did
*  not?
*  I think we first have to acknowledge that when rubber hit the road, many public schools
*  were not there.
*  And then when many parents, myself included, argued that they should be there for that
*  exact reason, they called us a bunch of names, up to and including racists or wine moms or
*  yoga moms or whatever it was.
*  That advocacy was not something that was real when many of them were arguing, yes, on behalf
*  of their kids, but on behalf of other kids, too.
*  I don't think it's the right answer for everyone to abandon public schools.
*  So I don't want as a society to abandon this infrastructure that is here, that does have
*  these resources, in many cases, a lot of resources because the COVID money came in and much of
*  it has not been spent.
*  I would like that to be spent on like, I don't know, not maybe major new admin expenses,
*  but actual student stuff.
*  I think that's a place where you can advocate for good behavior in your school board to
*  actually focus it on the kids.
*  So there are things to be done, but I think it argues for parent involvement from those
*  who are deeply concerned and who have the bandwidth sometimes to argue for other kids.
*  You know, because that's what teachers are doing, too.
*  The good teachers are advocating not for their own kids.
*  They're advocating for many kids, right?
*  So that's a thing you can do even while being a concerned parent.
*  What would you change about the public school system to address some of those dynamics?
*  The dynamics that you see between parents and teachers unions, where parents are getting
*  called wine mom and teachers are getting called grooming Nazis.
*  There's an impasse here that forgets that some parents are teachers and some teachers
*  are parents and they're all people who generally care about kids, I assume.
*  What would you change about that to one, end that impasse of some sort and to get us
*  to a better footing?
*  I think the problem that plagues this conversation is the one that plagues all American conversations,
*  which is, you know, one of the things that when I speak on college campuses, and I'll
*  speak often with my co-author Guy, is it will challenge students if they want to know how
*  supportive of free speech or to even engage with the notion that it's like good, which
*  many of them reject, maybe do a book trade, even if it's just a piece, right?
*  Let's keep it low barrier of entry.
*  Talk to each other for 20 minutes, set a timer without either one of you questioning the
*  motives of the other person.
*  When I tell college students that, they're like, could I do that?
*  It can be tricky, but it used to be something that I do feel we're better at.
*  And I do think there used to be a general understanding that allowing lots of ideas
*  to flourish and battle each other in the public square was a societal good.
*  I disagree.
*  You don't think we used to believe that?
*  No, we did not.
*  I think that with the let many flowers bloom idea, only certain flowers were permitted
*  to bloom within a specific, you know, it's like when people talk about like, oh, you
*  know, Congress used to work better because Democrats, Republicans all gathered and I'm
*  like, yeah, they were basically the same person.
*  I do think that that era of like working together, I mean, to me, based on my understanding of
*  events taking place before like 1970 is that, yes, people were getting along in some ways
*  because certain people were permitted to be in positions of power and they all generally
*  kind of knew and liked each other.
*  Well, I guess maybe I can rephrase that in that the understanding of cultural elites
*  even 10 years ago was sort of default that free speech served society, that flourishing
*  of viewpoints, that having raucous debates.
*  Now they maybe didn't live that in their lives.
*  And I agree with you that at times, obviously, different viewpoints are allowed to flourish
*  and not others.
*  So I think we have lost a cultural understanding there that I try to bring to the table.
*  So that's why that conversation is bad.
*  I do not know how to make it better aside from the tiny, small work that I do in my
*  daily life to have this conversation, to have conversations online where I'm not calling
*  people names, where I'm attempting to engage with their actual ideas.
*  Look, sometimes I think they're full of it.
*  Yes.
*  And sometimes I'll say that.
*  But I just think this is the same thing plaguing this conversation as it's plaguing everything
*  else.
*  go immediately to questioning motives.
*  And then it turns into this toxic thing.
*  And by the way, then you'll discover at times maybe the motive should have been questioned.
*  And that's that's sort of the part of making it even more toxic.
*  It's very, very tough work.
*  I agree with you with that.
*  It wasn't some like heyday when we were all great at talking to each other.
*  But I do think there was less incentive to find the disagreement with your neighbor instead
*  of say, hey, we both root for the same team.
*  Let's talk about that.
*  It's like, we got to find the other thing.
*  And then once we find the other thing that we disagree on, I must eliminate you from
*  my life as opposed to engaging with that idea.
*  I can't break bread with you because you are now in this group.
*  Polling shows that that has increased and is not great for us putting up those kind
*  of walls.
*  And I think those kind of walls exist between school boards and parents in many cases.
*  I want to close out by talking a little bit about 2024.
*  Republicans have an abundance of choice, arguably too much choice and the GOP primary.
*  What do you think Republicans are ultimately choosing between?
*  What they're actually choosing between is the chance to win a national election and
*  the chance to lose one dramatically.
*  That doesn't mean that Trump for sure would lose.
*  Not at all.
*  But look, he's very vulnerable.
*  It's a perfect storm for Democrats really in that every indictment is an indictment
*  bump, but only in the primary.
*  It's not like you're winning suburban moms with your indictment bumps, which is what
*  you need to do this.
*  And the thing that I put to many Trump voters is how is he going to do it differently?
*  What's the plan?
*  Like I don't want to argue with you about 2020, but he's not the president.
*  So what does he do differently?
*  And his answer is nothing.
*  His answer is nothing.
*  He thinks that he's beloved in Nevada.
*  Suburban moms, not a problem.
*  Not a problem at all.
*  He doesn't need to win them.
*  He doesn't need to do anything with independence.
*  He doesn't need to win the collar counties of Philadelphia.
*  He doesn't need to change his message in Arizona.
*  And to them, I say, look, if you're losing in Arizona and Georgia, you lost a long time
*  ago.
*  Okay.
*  And you got to make a plan to do something different.
*  Now I would say every other candidate does have some thoughts about how one would run
*  differently than 2020.
*  And that is, I know the bar's on the floor, y'all, but that is how you pitch winning in
*  2024.
*  Now I'm not the voice of the GOP electorate very clearly.
*  Okay.
*  I try to respect that and I try to listen to people.
*  But I do think he's just sort of foregoing the idea of even thinking about how he could
*  change anything to win the presidency.
*  So I think if you're interested in winning the presidency under this banner, then you
*  need to think about that.
*  I think that there's a book to be written that's like Donald Trump's guide to having
*  just perpetual confidence in yourself.
*  It's almost inspiring concerning, but inspiring.
*  And it's spanned his career, right?
*  Any loss is not a loss.
*  Any bankruptcy is not really a bankruptcy.
*  Any loss of money is not really a loss of money.
*  Any bad press is not really bad press.
*  And often it works.
*  I don't know how to solve that problem.
*  The candidates that will hopefully be on stage with him in a debate, if he shows up, have
*  a weird needle to thread.
*  You have to speak to Trump voters.
*  You cannot just abandon them or tell them they're all terrible or be too critical of
*  Trump.
*  If you're Chris Christie, I don't think you're earning a lot of those votes.
*  Although I will say a forceful, good speaker can make headway in a way that Christie has
*  by just kind of being bold and confident.
*  And he has done that.
*  I would say the argument against his candidacy is that he's like, I'm going to take Trump
*  down.
*  It's like, well, you had a chance to do that before and you didn't.
*  All of them have to walk this weird line where they don't attack him too much, but they find
*  the right way to attack him.
*  And if they tag him too much, that's actually a bump for him.
*  And if he gets bad news, that's actually a bump for him also.
*  And people don't want to hear about policy.
*  They want to hear about the fights you're having.
*  But if you talk about the fights you're having, the independents and the suburban moms are
*  going to hate you.
*  It is not easy, but it's not designed to be easy.
*  And it is a puzzle.
*  And I think to me, the simple message is, are you winning with this guy?
*  Are you winning so much that you're tired of winning?
*  Because it doesn't feel like I'm tired of winning right now.
*  I can win.
*  I can get results.
*  That's the other thing.
*  He was the president.
*  In some places for conservatives, he got results.
*  And many of the things he most complains about, he didn't.
*  So you say, he was there for four years.
*  He had his chance.
*  He didn't do it.
*  I can do it.
*  Here's how I'm going to do it.
*  You've talked about how Governor Brown DeSantis has the power to combine populism with traditional
*  conservatism.
*  What does that mean?
*  So I think to me, he is the...
*  Now this is like on paper.
*  He is the obvious choice that Trump voters could like him.
*  He has not turned them off in any major way.
*  He has a bit of the, he fights vibe.
*  That's one of the things I think I really like Tim Scott.
*  And I think he has a talent for, A, fundraising, B, speaking and making a moment for himself.
*  He's very good at sort of getting a little flare up of like, oh, this is his moment.
*  And he makes people feel good about America.
*  He is a happy warrior.
*  I am not convinced the electorate is looking for a happy warrior.
*  I think they're looking for a warrior.
*  Happy to be disproven because I like to be a happy warrior myself.
*  But I think DeSantis has more of that.
*  I am a fighter versus a happy warrior, which is something that people like from Trump and
*  want from Trump.
*  I think that he has a real distinguishing moment, which is the COVID moment.
*  Now a lot of Trump supporters will very swiftly start defending every lockdown policy or every
*  policy choice that Donald Trump made and sort of throw out the window all their tweets from
*  2020 that were upset about these things.
*  I think DeSantis has a record that he can say, again, I don't know whether the electorate
*  is in for this.
*  But I think there's a very obvious point to be made, which is, look, knock on me is like,
*  I'm really into the numbers.
*  I'm too into the numbers, not enough glad handing, whatever.
*  I look at the numbers because I care about getting policy right.
*  And I looked at the numbers very deeply in 2020.
*  And I got this call right in a lot of ways where he got it wrong.
*  And we would have been in a different place.
*  Particularly the schools being open is a win for him.
*  I think just a clean win.
*  And Trump supporters will say, well, he said that schools should go back.
*  And it's like, true, I will defend him on that.
*  He did say that in summer 2020, that they should work on it.
*  Did he have a plan for making that happen?
*  No. And that's where you get to the difference between the two.
*  So I think to my mind, the lockdowns of 2020 and the school shutdowns, one of the major
*  civil liberty battles of our time, where it was just like this vast,
*  very quickly decided, almost no process.
*  You can't go to restaurants and you can't go to church.
*  That's a big deal.
*  And a lot of people want to treat it like it's not a big deal.
*  And maybe I'm the outlier.
*  But I do think there's an argument to be made for his, and yes,
*  I think it was partially ideological, that his tendency was to value
*  as much freedom as possible to do those everyday things.
*  And valuing the economy, yes, while also attempting to protect people.
*  And I think the preservation of freedom itself was valuable.
*  I think that's an argument he can make.
*  I wonder how many GOP voters care about it once Trump is on the stage fighting against it.
*  I don't know.
*  A bunch of people, kind of center-right people, expected that 2022 would be a red wave
*  and a bloodbath, in part because of COVID policy.
*  That there were a host of Democratic governors and Democratic leaders who had put forth
*  very strict lockdown policies that they themselves may not even really abided by
*  in a lot of states, and that they would get punished by the electorate for it.
*  And that didn't happen.
*  No, it was basically Virginia, Nevada, and like New Jersey was a close call.
*  And that was all, most of that was 2021.
*  Yep. Like Gretchen Whitmer, stronger than ever.
*  You saw this in Minnesota, you saw in Ohio, even with having Republican governor,
*  people get very mad at him because of lockdown policies or his COVID policies.
*  He's fine.
*  Do we have a shorter memory for COVID than you thought we would?
*  Absolutely. And this is one thing where I cop to caring deeply about this and therefore
*  possibly over-reading it.
*  I didn't over-read it in Virginia.
*  That was one moment where I was like, I think this is all going to hinge on schools.
*  And a couple of people were like, no, that's crazy.
*  Nobody in Northern Virginia is voting for Yonkin over schools.
*  And I was like, okay, we'll see.
*  So there are moments where that happened.
*  There were not a lot of moments where that happened.
*  I think you see it more in those numbers I was talking about earlier, which is a big
*  deal with Democrats losing a double digit generational lead on education, that kind
*  of thing. Part of it, I think, is that it was a really, really hard time, particularly
*  in the places that were most shut down.
*  And people don't want to think about it.
*  They want to move on from that.
*  And so I think that rehashing it can come with trouble.
*  And this is one of, I think, one of the challenges that DeSantis faces, of course, as
*  usual in the primary, no rules apply to Donald Trump, but they all apply to everyone
*  else. So Donald Trump can talk about 2020 all day and that's fine.
*  But talking about 2020 and 2021 and your actual policies on the ground in this very
*  formidable moment for our country is like, well, are we looking back for it a little
*  too much? You know, so prosecuting that case is hard.
*  And I but I do think there's more appetite for it in a GOP primary electorate
*  than there is in the general electorate.
*  I think that part of why the conservative ecosystem is rooting for Ron DeSantis is
*  that he is a conservative that they understand.
*  He supported privatizing Social Security back in 2012.
*  He was talking about how he really wanted to embrace then-Representative Paul Ryan's
*  policies back in 2012.
*  I think that there's a sense to me, as someone who thinks a lot about conservatism, has
*  looked and watched conservatism for a very long time, that Ron DeSantis is a
*  conservative that conservatives get.
*  You know, he's run Florida as a conservative.
*  When he was in Congress, he was a conservative Republican.
*  Donald Trump is not a conservative.
*  People have said that repeatedly and expected people to be like, oh, well, in that case,
*  I shall not vote for him.
*  But that isn't what happened.
*  He's done things that conservatives liked on judges or tax cuts, things like that.
*  But there was really kind of a sense of like waving a carrot in front of him and being
*  like, okay, here's the judicial nominations we would like.
*  Now please stop tweeting.
*  And now DeSantis trails Trump by close to 30 percentage points in recent polling.
*  What do you make of that gap and what that says about where the conservative
*  ecosystem is right now?
*  One thing I have to be careful of and one thing that I was not careful of in 2016 is
*  forgetting that I am ideological.
*  No, most people are not.
*  And I have to think about, as I say sometimes to political crowds, is that when you're
*  talking to the normies who you have to earn their votes, one of the things you want to
*  do is just keep in mind that you are like a giant Days of Our Lives wrestling fan,
*  whatever it is, that in your mind, everything that happens every single day is deeply
*  important to the country and to the storyline.
*  And you must tune in every day.
*  And your friend who doesn't watch Days of Our Lives wrestling, I don't know, I feel
*  like if I tune in four years from now, Hope and Bo will be kind of doing the same thing.
*  And I'll just check in then.
*  So you have to adjust for that.
*  And many people don't.
*  And many people in GOP leadership don't.
*  One of the things that struck me about 2016 is I think it was true.
*  There were many good messengers for conservatism for this slate of issues and ideas on that
*  stage who were not Donald Trump.
*  And the fact that they were good messengers for that message means the message was rejected.
*  They wanted a new suite of things to talk about.
*  And so to my mind, many of those who are critical of Trump, as I am, but many of those
*  who are very critical of Trump, don't deal with that reality of the GOP electorate, that
*  their desires were not being met by this other slate of issues.
*  I think you're right.
*  DeSantis is a more movement conservative style.
*  So there is that.
*  But I think, again, he gives a fighter vibe.
*  But yes, I think you're largely right.
*  One of the reasons conservatives have turned to him is I think he has a record.
*  He raises money.
*  That big win for him in his re-elect is a huge part of this puzzle as well.
*  I mean, the proof's in the pudding.
*  And I think that's one of the early answers to Trump that was effective was he was kind
*  of just like, look at the scoreboard, man.
*  Like, I appreciate you being my constituent, but like, look what I did.
*  That's real.
*  DeSantis is not just very conservative.
*  He is also performing being very conservative in a way that I find extraordinarily
*  off-putting on a personal level.
*  His campaign made that ad that basically celebrated the anger of LGBT people and attacked
*  Donald Trump for saying he'd protect LGBTQ people from terrorism.
*  That's literally to me, I'm like, absolutely not.
*  I would sooner set myself on fire than support him.
*  I get that there's the political impulse to promise pizza for everyone and you can't do
*  it, but also do not turn off like a large swath of Americans, especially when you're
*  going to need to turn them back on later.
*  Okay.
*  So I think some of this is a play for Iowa specifically, where Kim Reynolds
*  enjoys 50 plus percent approval and also...
*  She was so nasty to Mr.
*  Trump.
*  And actually, Iowans responded badly to that.
*  Many of them gave an answer that said, no, thank you to that.
*  I think it was 70 plus percent disapproved of that attack on her.
*  Also, she signed a six week portion, man.
*  There are other examples of Kemp in Georgia, DeWine in Ohio winning by huge margins and
*  having done that because it's something that they believe in.
*  Right.
*  So on that issue in particular, I think he looks to those numbers and says, look, this
*  is a thing that I promised or I believe in and it does not have to be a deal breaker.
*  So I think some of this is a play for Iowa.
*  And I think some of it, frankly, is a dance that we always do in every primary, which
*  is like, oh, we got a dance over here to the right and then we're going to come on back.
*  So I'm not sure how much of that is unique to him, but I do think it poses a challenge,
*  particularly, and he's made this argument.
*  He says, like suburban voters were his bread and butter in Florida.
*  So again, you go back to that roadmap and say, okay, well, how did we win those folks?
*  And the question is, did you win them with these messages or did you win them with a
*  different message?
*  Because eventually you're going to have to get back to winning them because you don't
*  win the presidency without those suburban callers of all these major metro centers in
*  Virginia, in Pennsylvania, in Arizona, in Georgia, especially Georgia.
*  So I think it becomes a challenge for him, but it's a challenge that most primary, most
*  people in a competitive primary must deal with at some point.
*  We like to conclude with book recommendations.
*  So Mary Katherine Hamm, what are your book recommendations?
*  Oh, yes.
*  Okay.
*  So my favorite, maybe my favorite book of all time is Wise Blood by Flannery O'Connor.
*  It's just like the right amount, creepy and Christian and like the Christ haunted
*  South and bizarre stuff going on.
*  Also beautifully written.
*  So that's like an American classic.
*  So I just read The Rules of Civility by Amr Toles.
*  Just a beautiful writer.
*  I had also read A Gentleman in Moscow.
*  He's one of those writers that I don't really even care what you're writing.
*  Michael Chabon is similar.
*  The prose is just so good.
*  And then I'll give a shout out to Matthew Contenetti's The Right, which is a history of
*  the American right and conservatism, which will speak to in a more erudite sense than
*  I did many of the things that we have talked about in this podcast.
*  I read that a couple of months ago and it's readable and fair.
*  And even if you just do parts of it, you'll learn things about the arc of conservatism.
*  I did.
*  And I've been in this for 25 years or so.
*  Yeah.
*  I had a conversation with Matthew a couple of years ago when I was at Vox and one thing
*  he told me was like, well, the challenge is no one really knows what conservatism is.
*  I'm like, ah.
*  And it's become more and more unclear over the past several years.
*  What a journey we're all on.
