# Pete Buttigieg Does the Math on the American Dream
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxL-nWbvTVE)
*  Vice President Harris has said that what she wants to build is an opportunity economy.
*  What is different about the theory of it this time?
*  If we've been pursuing this for so long across so many administrations, so many sessions
*  of Congress, and we haven't gotten to a thing where people can say, look, we've built the
*  opportunity economy that you've been promised by administration after administration.
*  What about either the definition of opportunity here or the policies under consideration here
*  will make that different?
*  Well, I'll tell you the yardstick I would use to see if we're getting to the thing.
*  And it's social mobility.
*  The kind of mathematical definition of the American dream, if it can be reduced to that,
*  is the likelihood that you're going to wind up better off than you started.
*  If you were born in 1945, there's a 90% chance that would be true for someone your age or
*  my age.
*  It's coin flip.
*  Changing that is, I think, the best indicator that this is an opportunity economy, that
*  this is an opportunity society.
