# Nate Silver on Peter Thielâ€™s Worst Political Bet
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQVjXzLo6-4)
*  Before now, you would have said J.D. Vance was Peter Thiel's political bet that paid off best.
*  Yeah.
*  And now it might be his political bet that pays off worst.
*  If these guys are so good at making bets, what are they missing in politics?
*  To his credit, he did back Trump at a time when that seemed like a big risk to take.
*  It seemed like it was probably going to be the wrong bet.
*  But no, I mean, these guys often are pretty dumb about politics, right?
*  And so like, why do they succeed despite that?
*  I think because the idea of having a longer time horizon, number one,
*  and being willing to make these plus expected value, positive expected value,
*  high risk, but very, very, very high upside bets and gathering a portfolio of them repeatedly
*  and making one of these bets that you effectively do hedge your risk, right?
*  Like those two ideas are so good that it makes up for the fact these guys often have terrible judgment
*  and are kind of vainglorious **** off of them, right?
