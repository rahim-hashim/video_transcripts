Video Description: I honestly don’t know how I should be educating my kids. A.I. has raised a lot of questions for schools. Teachers have had to adapt to the most ingenious cheating technology ever devised. But for me, the deeper question is: What should schools be teaching at all? A.I. is going to make the future look very different. How do you prepare kids for a world you can’t predict? 
And if we can offload more and more tasks to generative A.I., what’s left for the human mind to do?
Rebecca Winthrop is the director of the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution. She is also an author, with Jenny Anderson, of “The Disengaged Teen: Helping Kids Learn Better, Feel Better, and Live Better.” We discuss how A.I. is transforming what it means to work and be educated, and how our use of A.I. could revive — or undermine — American schools.

# Educating Kids in the Age of A.I. | The Ezra Klein Show
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE)
*  Here's a statistic I've been thinking about recently. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=0.0s)]
*  In 1976, about 40% of high school seniors had read six books or more for fun in the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3.72s)]
*  last year. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=9.88s)]
*  Only about 11% hadn't read a single book for fun. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=10.96s)]
*  Today, those numbers are basically reversed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=14.24s)]
*  About 40% haven't read a single book for fun. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=17.8s)]
*  If you are looking for this, you see it everywhere right now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  There are all these headlines about how kids are not reading the way they once did. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=25.52s)]
*  There are all these stories quoting professors, even at Ivy League universities, about the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=30.4s)]
*  way in which when they try to assign the reading that they've been assigning their entire careers, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=34.76s)]
*  their students, they just can't do it anymore. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=40.6s)]
*  We're losing something. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  We can see it on test scores that over the last decade, we just see the number of kids [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=45.36s)]
*  reading at grade level slipping. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=49.36s)]
*  And then of course, the pandemic accelerated that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=50.92s)]
*  So if you were simply asking, how are the kids doing on some of these intellectual [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=55.3s)]
*  faculties that we once thought were the core of what education was trying to promote? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=60.94s)]
*  They're not doing well. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=67.38s)]
*  And then as if we summoned it, as if we wrote it into the script, here comes this technology, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=69.22s)]
*  generative AI, that can do it for them. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=77.7s)]
*  Imagine you could read any book in less than 30 seconds, no matter how long it is. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  It'll read the book and summarize it for you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=85.82000000000001s)]
*  Any style nonfiction book in 10 minutes. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=89.3s)]
*  It'll write the essay for you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=92.30000000000001s)]
*  GBT is going to do the bulk of the writing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=94.26s)]
*  Co-pilot is good for factual information, and GBT zero helps you not get caught. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=96.38000000000001s)]
*  It'll do the math problem, even shown its work, for you. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  And it doesn't matter if the question is typed out or handwritten. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=104.9s)]
*  It works on both. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=107.18s)]
*  Yeah, the future is crazy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=108.18s)]
*  Of course, using it that way, we call it cheating. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=109.66s)]
*  But to them, why wouldn't you? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  If you have this technology, they not only can, but will be doing so much of this for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=114.06s)]
*  you, for us, for the economy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  Why are we doing any of this at all? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  And this intersects with an anxiety I have as a parent of a three and a six-year-old. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=122.74s)]
*  I don't know what the economy, what society is going to want from them in 16 or 20 years. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=128.22s)]
*  And if I don't know what it's going to want from them, what it's going to reward in them, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=135.73999999999998s)]
*  how do I know how they should be educated? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=140.94s)]
*  How do I know if the education I am creating for them is doing a good job? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  How do I know if I'm failing them? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=148.45999999999998s)]
*  The purpose of education in schools is profoundly shaken to its core. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=150.1s)]
*  My guest today is Rebecca Winthrop. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  She's the director of the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institute. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=158.42s)]
*  Her latest book, co-authored with Jenny Anderson, is The Disengaged Teen. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=163.26000000000002s)]
*  Helping kids learn better, feel better, and live better. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=168.02s)]
*  So here's my email, Ezra Klein Show at nytimes.com. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=172.06s)]
*  Rebecca Winthrop, welcome to the show. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=182.06s)]
*  Lovely to be here, Ezra. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=184.5s)]
*  I'm a three and a six-year-old. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=185.5s)]
*  I feel like I cannot predict with AI what it is society will want or reward from them [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=187.78s)]
*  in 15, 16 years. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=196.9s)]
*  Which makes this question in the interim, how should they be educated? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=199.86s)]
*  What should they be educated towards? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=203.26s)]
*  Feel really uncertain to me. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=205.78s)]
*  My confidence that the schools are set up now for the world they are going to graduate [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=208.7s)]
*  into is very, very low. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=212.98s)]
*  So you study education. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=215.3s)]
*  You've been thinking a lot about education and AI. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=217.02s)]
*  What advice would you give me? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=220.34s)]
*  So approximately a third of kids are deeply engaged. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=222.46s)]
*  Two thirds of the kids are not. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=226.66000000000003s)]
*  So we need to have learning experiences that motivate kids to dig in and engage and be [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=228.44s)]
*  excited to learn. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=234.38000000000002s)]
*  So when friends or relatives ask me the same question, I usually say, look, we have to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=235.94s)]
*  think about three parts to the answer. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=244.98s)]
*  Why do you want your kids to be educated? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=249.5s)]
*  What is the purpose of education? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=252.32s)]
*  Because actually now that we have AI that can write essays and pass the bar exam and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  do AP exams just as good or better than kids, we have to really rethink the purpose of education. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=261.3s)]
*  The second thing we have to think about is how kids learn. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=268.92s)]
*  And we know a lot about that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=273.56s)]
*  And the third thing is what they should learn. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=276.32s)]
*  Like, what's the content? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  What are the skills? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=280.88s)]
*  People always think of education as sort of a transactional transmission of knowledge, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=282.38s)]
*  which is one important piece of it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=288.12s)]
*  But it is actually so much more than that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=289.54s)]
*  Learning to live with other people, learning to know yourself and developing the flexible [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=292.12s)]
*  competencies to be able to navigate a world of uncertainty. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=297.64s)]
*  Those are kind of the the whys for me. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=301.44s)]
*  But you know, I might ask you, what are your hopes and dreams for your kids under the why [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=304.12s)]
*  before we get to the details of the skills? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=310.24s)]
*  Well, I have a lot of hopes and dreams for my kids. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=312.28s)]
*  I would like them to live happy, fulfilling lives. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  I think I'm not naive. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=319.84s)]
*  And certainly in my lifetime, the implicit purpose of education, the way we say to ourselves, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=322.44s)]
*  did this kid's education work out? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=331.92s)]
*  Is do they get a good job? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=335.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=336.92s)]
*  That's really what we're, you know, pointing the arrow towards. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=337.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=340.72s)]
*  The fact that maybe develop their faculties as a human being, the fact that maybe they [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=341.72s)]
*  learned things that were beautiful or fascinating. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  That's all great. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=350.32s)]
*  But if they do all that and they don't get a good job, then we failed them. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=351.6s)]
*  And if they do none of that, but they do get a good job, then we succeeded. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=356.32000000000005s)]
*  So I think that's been the reality of education. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  But I also think that reality relies a little bit on an economy. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=365.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  In which we've asked people to act very often as machines of a kind. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  And now we've created these machines that can act or mimic as people of a kind. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=375.7s)]
*  And so now the whole transaction is being thrown into some chaos. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=382.46s)]
*  The skills that I think are going to be most important are how motivated and engaged kids [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=386.46s)]
*  are to be able to learn new things. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=390.94s)]
*  That is maybe one of the most important skills in a time of uncertainty. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=393.7s)]
*  That they are go-getters. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=398.21999999999997s)]
*  They're going to be wayfinders. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=399.74s)]
*  Things are going to shift and change. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=401.5s)]
*  And they're going to be able to navigate and constantly learn new things and be excited [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=402.98s)]
*  to learn new things. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=407.38s)]
*  Because when kids are motivated, that's actually a huge predictor of how they do. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=408.46s)]
*  And we're going to want kids absolutely to know enough content so that they can be a [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=415.26s)]
*  judge of what is real and what is fake. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=420.66s)]
*  But we're also going to want them to have experiences where they're learning and testing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=424.34s)]
*  how to come up with creative new solutions to things. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=431.08000000000004s)]
*  Which is not really what traditional public education has been about. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=434.76s)]
*  I think sometimes about this distinction between education as a virtue and education as something [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=439.04s)]
*  that is instrumental. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=449.0s)]
*  Education is training. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=450.5s)]
*  Studying the classics was important. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=452.52000000000004s)]
*  Not because it made it likelier that you got into law school. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=454.8s)]
*  But because it deepened your appreciation of beauty. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=458.92s)]
*  It deepened your capacities as a human being. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=461.56s)]
*  And I think for reasons that make a lot of sense in many ways, we drifted away from that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=464.72s)]
*  And I don't know that you build a society off of people just enjoying what they're studying. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=472.78000000000003s)]
*  And at the same time, I worry now we have pulled people into a conveyor belt. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=479.64s)]
*  That when they get to the other side of it, there's not going to be that much there. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=484.32s)]
*  And I don't even think you need to imagine AI for that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=488.88s)]
*  That's already happening to a lot of people. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=491.0s)]
*  I think one reason you see a lot of anger among young people today is that the deal [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=492.92s)]
*  often doesn't come through. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=497.8s)]
*  You do all the extracurriculars. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=500.28s)]
*  You get your good grades. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=502.32s)]
*  You show up on time. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=504.08s)]
*  And then you graduate college and the good jobs and the interesting life you were promised [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=506.52s)]
*  just aren't there. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=512.92s)]
*  And so there's something there that feels like it is getting thrown into question. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=515.84s)]
*  If we don't know what the future is going to ask of us, how can we be instrumental in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=522.48s)]
*  the way we train people for it? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=527.76s)]
*  We can't be super instrumental. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=530.08s)]
*  So we have to come up with a new plan. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=533.22s)]
*  We did not know collectively, us, the world, that we would have generative AI that could [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=537.0400000000001s)]
*  basically write every seventh grade essay or college essay to get into university or [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=541.58s)]
*  the whole host of exams that are being administered and are being passed by AI just as well or [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=550.82s)]
*  better than kids. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=557.72s)]
*  So we have to come up with a new plan. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=559.1800000000001s)]
*  That is not the plan for success. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=562.0200000000001s)]
*  And we need to have kids build that muscle of doing hard things because I worry greatly [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=564.94s)]
*  that AI will basically make a frictionless world for young people. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=573.5400000000001s)]
*  It's great for me. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=580.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm loving generative AI, but I have said several decades of brain development where [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=581.0600000000001s)]
*  I know how to do hard things. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=588.22s)]
*  But kids are developing their brains. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=591.24s)]
*  They're literally being neurobiologically wired for how to attend, how to focus, how [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=592.9s)]
*  to try, how to connect ideas, how to relate to other people. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=600.02s)]
*  And all of those are not easy things. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=606.14s)]
*  And I want to push back on something you said. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=609.54s)]
*  You said, I don't know if kids just enjoy what they're learning. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=611.9s)]
*  It's going to help or people are really going to benefit from that. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=616.04s)]
*  Education is very powerful. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=620.9s)]
*  It's basically how motivated you are to really dig in and learn. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=623.0799999999999s)]
*  And it relates to what you do. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=630.16s)]
*  Do you show up? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=632.0s)]
*  Do you participate? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=633.0s)]
*  Do you do your homework? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=634.0s)]
*  It relates to how you feel. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=635.0s)]
*  Do you find school interesting? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=636.0s)]
*  Is it exciting? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=638.34s)]
*  Do you feel you belong at school? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=639.34s)]
*  It relates to how you think. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=641.3s)]
*  Are you cognitively engaged? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=643.14s)]
*  Are you looking at what you learn in one class, applying it to what it might mean in your [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  life outside or other classes? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=649.4599999999999s)]
*  And it's also how proactive you are about your learning. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=652.14s)]
*  And all those dimensions really work together in education that's a very powerful construct [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=655.02s)]
*  to predict better achievement, better grades, better mental health, more enrollment in college, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=663.02s)]
*  better understanding of content, and lots of other benefits to boot. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=668.3399999999999s)]
*  So you have in your book these four modes of engagement. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=674.98s)]
*  Do you want to talk through them? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=678.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=679.86s)]
*  So we found after three years of research that kids engage in four different ways. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=680.86s)]
*  They're passenger mode, kids are coasting, achiever mode, they're trying to get perfect [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=687.9s)]
*  outcomes, resistor mode, they're avoiding and disrupting, and explorer mode is when [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=692.3s)]
*  they really love what they're learning and they dig in and they're super proactive. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=697.3s)]
*  So that's the high level framework. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=701.88s)]
*  What part do you want to dig in on? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=705.9s)]
*  Well, why don't you go through them? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=707.2199999999999s)]
*  I think passenger mode is particularly interesting here. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=708.42s)]
*  So why don't we start there? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=711.78s)]
*  So passenger mode is difficult to spot often for parents and sometimes teachers because [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=714.5799999999999s)]
*  many kids in passenger mode get really good grades but are just bored to tears. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=724.8599999999999s)]
*  They show up to school, they do the homework, they have dropped out of learning. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=729.78s)]
*  So passenger mode is when kids are really coasting doing the bare minimum. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=736.04s)]
*  Some signs of this are your kid comes home and they do their homework as fast as possible. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=740.4s)]
*  Another sign is that they say, oh, school's boring. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=747.1999999999999s)]
*  It's just boring. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=750.64s)]
*  I learned nothing. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=751.64s)]
*  Kids are in passenger mode because school is actually too easy for them. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=753.8399999999999s)]
*  We talked to so many kids who said, look, I'm in class and the teacher's going over [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=758.28s)]
*  the math homework from yesterday and I got everyone right and I know the answers and [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=767.12s)]
*  it's 45 minutes of that. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=771.76s)]
*  I understand the kids who don't get it, they need the help, but I'm going to shop online. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=774.4s)]
*  Or I have kids who say, well, I got the homework home and I know how to do this stuff so I [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=780.9599999999999s)]
*  just put in chat GPT. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=786.48s)]
*  And it did my problem set for me and then I turn it in. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=788.24s)]
*  So that's when it's too easy. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=792.2s)]
*  Another version of why kids get into passenger mode is when it's too hard. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=795.64s)]
*  School's too hard. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=800.44s)]
*  You could have a neurodivergent kid. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=801.44s)]
*  Kids don't feel they belong and so they're not tuning in. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=803.88s)]
*  They've missed certain pieces of skill sets that they really need. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=809.44s)]
*  Education is cumulative in many ways and they get kind of overwhelmed and they need particular [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=816.2s)]
*  special attention. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  So that's kind of what's going on in passenger mode. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=823.24s)]
*  One reason I wanted to start in passenger mode is that when I think about ways AI probably [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=827.8000000000001s)]
*  is now but can be very harmful, it's the connection with that mode. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=833.4000000000001s)]
*  Because in passenger mode, what you want to do and many of us have done passenger mode [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=840.48s)]
*  at work and many of us have done it at school. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=845.12s)]
*  In some ways, passenger mode was what I aspired to be at school. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=847.12s)]
*  I just wasn't able to achieve it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=849.64s)]
*  But you're reading something you think is boring. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=852.44s)]
*  You're reading something you don't want to be reading. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=855.12s)]
*  But you want to get a good grade. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=857.5200000000001s)]
*  So maybe at an earlier point you would buy the spark notes. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=859.76s)]
*  But now you just have chat GPT summarize it and more than that, you can have chat GPT [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=864.1600000000001s)]
*  write the essay. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=871.12s)]
*  Kids are getting better at telling chat GPT, no, you actually were too good of a teacher. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=872.6s)]
*  You can't even say like dumb it down a little bit that you basically hired your own like [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=875.0799999999999s)]
*  filling student who can help you coast. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=882.92s)]
*  And that will help you get if you're able to do it jointly enough, decent grades. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=889.76s)]
*  But also whatever meta skills, forget the knowledge, whatever meta skills are being [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=895.8399999999999s)]
*  taught how to read a book, how to write an essay, you're not actually learning them. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=900.24s)]
*  And that's, I think, when people think educationally about AI, a bit of the fear and something [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  that I believe everybody believes is happening now. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=911.96s)]
*  So how do you think about that interaction? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=914.52s)]
*  I think you're 100% right. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=917.04s)]
*  I've talked to kids all over the country. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=919.84s)]
*  I've seen lots of incidents or cases of highly motivated, highly engaged kids who are using [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=922.64s)]
*  AI really well. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=930.3199999999999s)]
*  They'll write the paper themselves, they'll go in and use AI for research and help them [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=931.72s)]
*  copy edit. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=938.08s)]
*  They're doing the thinking and they've lined up the evidence to create a thesis and they've [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=940.08s)]
*  presented it in logical order on their own. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=945.4399999999999s)]
*  And that is the art of thinking. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=948.96s)]
*  And that's why we assign seventh graders to write essays or 10th graders to write essays. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=950.72s)]
*  It's not that they're going to create incredible works of art. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=956.4000000000001s)]
*  It's to train them how to think logically and how to think in steps. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=961.0400000000001s)]
*  And that is a core component of critical thinking. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=965.1600000000001s)]
*  So as long as kids are mastering that and the AI is helping, that's a good use. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=967.32s)]
*  a lot of kids are using it to do exactly like you said, shortcut the assignments. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=974.36s)]
*  So an example, one kid I talked to said, well, you know, this is a high school kid. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=980.78s)]
*  For my essay, I break the prompt into three parts. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=986.96s)]
*  I run it through three different generative AI models. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=990.6800000000001s)]
*  I put it together. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=993.6s)]
*  I run it through three anti-plagiarism checkers and then I turn it in. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=994.6s)]
*  Another kid said, yeah, I do it. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=998.6800000000001s)]
*  I run it through chat GPT and then I run it through an AI humanizer, which goes in [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1000.64s)]
*  and puts typos in and makes it, you know, these kids are getting good at something. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1005.58s)]
*  I'm not sure it's what we want them getting good at, but they're getting good at something. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1009.24s)]
*  Kids will find a way no matter what. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1012.68s)]
*  Kids will find a way. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1015.18s)]
*  We cannot out maneuver them with technology. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1016.18s)]
*  So the first response when Gen. AI came in was ban it, block it, get anti-plagiarism [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1020.04s)]
*  checkers in, which are bad, by the way. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1025.46s)]
*  Like I talked to one kid who showed me he had this essay and the plagiarism checker [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1027.8s)]
*  flagged 40% of it and he changed two words and then it went away. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1033.68s)]
*  He's all good. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1037.68s)]
*  So, you know, it is worrisome. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1038.68s)]
*  So what we need to do is shift what we're doing in our teaching and learning experiences. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1040.52s)]
*  I have very personally complicated feelings on this, on the question of AI and education, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1045.9199999999998s)]
*  just question of education generally. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1050.8799999999999s)]
*  I hated school, hated it. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1053.68s)]
*  I hated terribly in it. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1056.76s)]
*  Starting in middle school, going through high school, failed classes, it just found the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1058.72s)]
*  whole thing impenetrable. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1062.64s)]
*  And not because I wasn't smart, not because I wasn't interested even in things related [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1065.52s)]
*  to it, just somehow the whole construct didn't work for me and I couldn't make it work for [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1071.2s)]
*  me. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1076.48s)]
*  It wasn't exactly that I was bored. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1077.48s)]
*  I think today I probably could have muscled through it, but for whatever reason then I [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1080.72s)]
*  couldn't. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1084.56s)]
*  I was voracious outside of school. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1086.48s)]
*  I spent three or four nights a week at Barnes and Nobles. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1088.32s)]
*  I loved reading deeply into things that I was interested in. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1091.1599999999999s)]
*  And I've related the story before and one of the sort of reactions I get is, well, you [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1095.24s)]
*  should really then recognize the way school fails kids. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1099.8s)]
*  And in a way I do, but it's just not obvious to me at all that school should be tuned for [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1103.8s)]
*  me. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1108.6399999999999s)]
*  Like one thing that I recognize is somebody who studies bureaucracies is that if you just [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1109.6399999999999s)]
*  think of U.S. public education, to say nothing of also private education, to say nothing [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1114.12s)]
*  of global education, it's educating a lot of kids. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1118.9199999999998s)]
*  And its ability to tune itself to every kid is going to be pretty modest. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1124.4799999999998s)]
*  And what kids need is different, but somehow you have to be orienting towards something [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1130.6399999999999s)]
*  that works for most of them, even if you're not sure how to make it work for all of them. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1137.0s)]
*  I'm curious how you think about that. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1141.56s)]
*  I am not sure I agree. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1143.92s)]
*  I think you, I agree with several things. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1146.68s)]
*  One, you are not alone. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1149.52s)]
*  There are many, many kids currently today are going through the system and feel like [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1151.3200000000002s)]
*  you. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1156.6000000000001s)]
*  Two, I agree with you that as sort of a bureaucratic system that is actually quite miraculous if [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1157.6000000000001s)]
*  you think about it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1166.88s)]
*  community across our country, kids as young as three to 18 at the same time of day are [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1169.08s)]
*  getting themselves to a place Monday through Friday for a certain amount of days in the [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1175.96s)]
*  year. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1181.56s)]
*  I mean, that is a, that is a organizational feat. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1182.56s)]
*  And the thing I don't agree with is that once you're there, you just have to design for [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1185.56s)]
*  the mean and the average. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1192.52s)]
*  I think there's lots of examples that are relatively big scale that, or at least not [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1195.24s)]
*  just one, you know, little school in a corner by one fabulous, you know, homespun teacher [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1201.96s)]
*  that do things differently. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1207.44s)]
*  And I think it actually just gets down to how we orchestrate teaching and learning experiences. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1210.28s)]
*  Give me one of those examples. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1216.2s)]
*  One of those examples of a schooling system able to educate in a personalized way at scale [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1217.92s)]
*  that seems to you to be replicable. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1227.2s)]
*  I'll give you a couple. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1229.04s)]
*  So there's an example of schools in North Dakota that have created studios for their [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1230.2s)]
*  adolescents. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1236.88s)]
*  And what are studios? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1237.88s)]
*  They are self-created classes that a student can design. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1239.16s)]
*  And so, and they have to tell you or tell the teacher what standards they're meeting. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1248.3600000000001s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1253.8400000000001s)]
*  We have a great character in the book I've done with Jenny Anderson, the disengaged teen [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1254.88s)]
*  named Kia. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1260.28s)]
*  And she was totally disengaged, doom scrolling in middle school, and then these studios showed [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1263.68s)]
*  up. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1269.8400000000001s)]
*  She got super into it because she was learning history and science and she decided to design [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1270.8400000000001s)]
*  an escape room. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1278.8600000000001s)]
*  And she had to list out for herself, these are the standards I'm meeting for whatever [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1280.4s)]
*  grade she was in, 10th grade, I think, history and science. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1284.8s)]
*  And she did an escape room around the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1288.36s)]
*  But she had to design this escape room. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1294.36s)]
*  That turned her on like nobody else. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1296.36s)]
*  And she got super excited and she did several of those. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1300.3999999999999s)]
*  And then she actually said she was so motivated she went back to sort of normal classes. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1304.9599999999998s)]
*  They're doing that across the district. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1308.9599999999998s)]
*  That's one small example. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1310.7199999999998s)]
*  There's other examples of schools that do really, we're talking about AI, do sort of [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1312.04s)]
*  tech-based education on core subjects for a couple hours a day, math, science, reading, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1318.6s)]
*  social studies. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1326.04s)]
*  And then for the rest of the day, they are doing projects together on whatever it may [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1327.04s)]
*  be that they so decide. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1331.1599999999999s)]
*  And there's a curriculum, there's things the teachers want them to learn. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1333.0s)]
*  It's not a every kid do whatever you want. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1335.96s)]
*  But that's super motivating. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1339.98s)]
*  There's no reason that we couldn't do that with the existing staff and people and school [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1341.48s)]
*  buildings and infrastructure. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1348.4s)]
*  We just have to have the willpower to decide to do things differently. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1349.8s)]
*  I want to zoom in on something in that story, which is that when the student you brought [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1353.44s)]
*  up found the thing that lit her up, she was then able to do better in all the other classes [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1359.2s)]
*  and maybe didn't. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1368.18s)]
*  This was a little bit of my own experience of life. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1370.26s)]
*  For me, it was political blogging, of all things, which I found as a freshman in college. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1372.94s)]
*  And once I activated, then I became much better at doing things that I didn't want to do or [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1378.94s)]
*  didn't exactly see the point of in even unrelated fields. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1386.14s)]
*  I love that. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1389.7s)]
*  So you started political blogging and then what happened? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1390.7s)]
*  I think the way what would have been the conventional line on me from the adults who knew me was [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1393.5s)]
*  a smart kid can't get it together. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1399.6200000000001s)]
*  Just can't seem to get the homework in. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1401.5s)]
*  Can't seem to do things he's not that interested in doing. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1403.3000000000002s)]
*  And can't even seem to do things he is interested in doing in a way that fits what we want from [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1406.8200000000002s)]
*  him. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1411.0600000000002s)]
*  I read every book in English class and I enjoy doing the essays. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1412.0600000000002s)]
*  And I'm a good writer. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1418.46s)]
*  I think I'm willing to say that at this point in my life. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1419.54s)]
*  I think you're allowed. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1421.98s)]
*  And I still did badly on the essays because it wasn't what they wanted for me in some [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1423.82s)]
*  way or another. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1429.82s)]
*  And over time, I just don't have that. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1431.98s)]
*  That was the broad experience of my life that I couldn't fit what I did to what the world [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1435.02s)]
*  wanted for me. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1439.78s)]
*  And now I'm just much better at doing that in ways that are not related to my core set [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1441.54s)]
*  of interests. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1446.9399999999998s)]
*  I'm not trying to over extrapolate my experience. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1447.9399999999998s)]
*  It's actually important to me not to over extrapolate my experience. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1449.3799999999999s)]
*  Something I've seen you talk about is this quality of when students find the teacher, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1452.42s)]
*  find the subject, find the approach that activates them. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1459.7s)]
*  That all of a sudden the things that are not that activating to them become easier. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1466.46s)]
*  That there is a sort of lock and a key dynamic. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1470.94s)]
*  There is. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1475.02s)]
*  And this is something we talk about around finding your spark. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1476.38s)]
*  Kids need to find their spark. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1483.22s)]
*  And they may have many sparks and their sparks may change. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1485.9s)]
*  But when kids find their spark, for Kia it was this idea of doing an escape room around [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1489.42s)]
*  historical residential assassinations. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1495.6200000000001s)]
*  She got excited. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1498.2600000000002s)]
*  Other students, they find sparks in other places. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1499.7s)]
*  One of the characters in our book, Samir, absolutely loved local politics and dove in, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1503.3s)]
*  getting himself on the school board, ultimately in high school. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1509.4199999999998s)]
*  Another student, Mateo, was super excited and turned on by robotics. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1513.08s)]
*  And that's what really turned him around. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1517.82s)]
*  And when you're motivated, this internal drive, it makes you engage more. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1519.86s)]
*  You lean in more. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1525.32s)]
*  You enjoy it more. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1526.6399999999999s)]
*  There's a virtuous upward cycle and there's lots of evidence to show that it often spills [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1528.02s)]
*  over. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1533.66s)]
*  So Kia talks about doing these studios for a couple years, which really helped her reengage [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1535.04s)]
*  and care about school. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1541.12s)]
*  And then she went back and did some high school college credit courses, which were very sort [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1543.9s)]
*  of traditional structure. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1550.78s)]
*  And she said she didn't love the structure, but she had enough motivation to figure out [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1554.26s)]
*  how to bend the class to her interests. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1558.8s)]
*  So that's the best case scenario. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1562.26s)]
*  It doesn't always spill over automatically. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1564.74s)]
*  What you talked about when you said you enjoyed it, you loved it, you loved English, but you [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1566.82s)]
*  didn't give the teachers what they want. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1570.3s)]
*  It's probably because you're a total explorer and we do not reward engaging in school in [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1572.7s)]
*  a way that supports explorers in general. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1580.1s)]
*  And that is what we have to change. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1583.76s)]
*  So then this gets to the AI optimist case. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1587.54s)]
*  I take the AI optimist case as something like this. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1590.76s)]
*  It's pretty hard to do personalized learning, even if you have examples that you've seen [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1594.6s)]
*  work because you have one teacher, it's a classroom of 20, 30 kids oftentimes. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1599.12s)]
*  But AI makes this completely different. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1606.44s)]
*  AI gives you more tutors than there are children. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1609.24s)]
*  It allows you to have tutors who adapt to that kid's individual learning style in any [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1614.0s)]
*  way you wanted to, in any way they wanted to. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1618.26s)]
*  If this kid is a visual learner, it can do visual learning. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1621.8s)]
*  If pop quizzes are helpful for them, they can do pop quizzes. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1624.7s)]
*  It can turn it into a podcast they listen to. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1626.96s)]
*  If you are more audio focused, everything can be turned into a poem. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1629.8799999999999s)]
*  If you absorb information better through the sonnet form, that as we get better at [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1635.02s)]
*  this and as we build these systems and tune them better, although they're already pretty [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1639.94s)]
*  capable here, that our ability to personalize education using artificial intelligence as [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1646.3s)]
*  tutors will be like nothing ever seen before in human history. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1652.0s)]
*  It's a complete quantum leap in educational possibility. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1655.96s)]
*  And as such, it allows you to bring every child into their educational utopia, whatever [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1660.02s)]
*  that is, to spark them, to turn them on, to make them into an explorer. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1664.78s)]
*  How do you feel about that more utopic vision? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1671.06s)]
*  I think we're on the same page. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1675.14s)]
*  Schools exist. They're important. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1676.38s)]
*  They're important for many reasons. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1678.5s)]
*  We need to change what we do inside of them, particularly because of gen AI, and we need [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1679.8600000000001s)]
*  to do it quickly. In addition to, I would say, regulating gen AI so it isn't so massively [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1684.3s)]
*  in students and young people's hands without being designed for that purpose. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1691.86s)]
*  I would say those are the two big things we need to do. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1695.74s)]
*  But I don't think our goal inside schools when we're educating young people is to have [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1698.58s)]
*  a 100 percent personalized learning journey for every kid. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1704.1799999999998s)]
*  What I think you're talking about is actually the ability for gen AI to help teachers, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1707.82s)]
*  which I think is very real. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1715.02s)]
*  I think there's a big difference and we need to make a big distinction between AI supporting [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1716.98s)]
*  educators in doing what they do versus going direct to young people. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1723.02s)]
*  Let me push you on this for a second before you go here, because if I'm taking the position [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1727.8200000000002s)]
*  of the AI optimist, what I'd say is, no, I'm not saying that. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1732.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm saying the AI will be better than the teachers. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1737.5400000000002s)]
*  Better at what? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1740.38s)]
*  If we are saying that AI is going to be better than the median for many people at many kinds [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1741.82s)]
*  of work, why would we not assume that this system we will be able to build in six years, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1747.66s)]
*  given how fast these things are developing, won't per kid be better than the teacher? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1754.3s)]
*  I'm not saying I believe this, but I want to make you argue with the AI optimist case. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1759.98s)]
*  But the question is better at what? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1764.62s)]
*  So teachers do many, many things. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1766.8200000000002s)]
*  Kids learn in relationships with other humans. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1769.0600000000002s)]
*  We've evolved to do that. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1772.46s)]
*  I do not think that we will go away from that or we may go away and then we'll be like, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1773.98s)]
*  oh my God, that was a huge mistake. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1780.3400000000001s)]
*  And 10 years later, go back. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1781.66s)]
*  So there's a question around skill development and knowledge transmission. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1783.7s)]
*  That is one thing a teacher does. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1787.66s)]
*  And I think that's what you're talking about. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1789.46s)]
*  That is an area where I think technology can be good. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1791.5400000000002s)]
*  Can be really good. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1796.78s)]
*  So and actually we see it even without genitive AI. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1798.02s)]
*  There's adaptive learning software, you know, that helps kids really, you know, learn to [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1801.5400000000002s)]
*  read, which is incredibly helpful, especially if you have access gaps. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1806.66s)]
*  You don't have good teachers. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1812.66s)]
*  You have large classes. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1813.66s)]
*  You have substitute teachers that aren't trained on how to teach kids to read. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1815.46s)]
*  So that complemented with things that motivate kids, get them excited and see the relevance [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1819.02s)]
*  of what they're doing, which is often in person could be a great, could be a great [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1824.9s)]
*  thing to do inside the classroom. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1830.02s)]
*  We see private schools doing that. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1832.8600000000001s)]
*  There's a group of schools that I have not visited and I don't know up close, but alpha [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1834.5800000000002s)]
*  schools are doing this. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1840.3400000000001s)]
*  They do. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1841.66s)]
*  And they've been doing it for 10 years, actually, pre-gen AI. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1842.02s)]
*  They do a couple, couple hours of sort of adaptive learning on key academic subjects. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1844.9s)]
*  And then the rest of the time, kids are working together to build bridges or learn about [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1850.3s)]
*  financial literacy or play sports or identify a passion that they want to go learn about in [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1856.02s)]
*  their community. It's together. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1860.5s)]
*  It's alone. What we don't want to do is bring AI in and have every kid sitting in front [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1861.98s)]
*  of a AI tutor alone at their desk for eight hours a day. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1867.3s)]
*  That's not the future that is going to help our kids. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1873.1000000000001s)]
*  I guess another way you might think about it is that this changes the job of the teacher [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1876.38s)]
*  quite substantially. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1881.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1882.98s)]
*  So. And I will say, I think I don't believe what I'm about to say, so I don't want to [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1883.98s)]
*  get yelled at by everybody for every take. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1888.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm not talking to you. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1891.5s)]
*  I'm talking to my beloved audience, my beloved audience. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1893.0200000000002s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1897.14s)]
*  But one thing I've observed is that it seems to me that where AI is going to push is towards [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1897.7399999999998s)]
*  the skills of the manager, the editor, the supervisor, the fact checker in a way, and [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1908.1s)]
*  often away from the skills, which are right now more numerous and needed in more numerous [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1915.7399999999998s)]
*  quantities of the worker, of the writer, of in this case, maybe the teacher. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1920.3s)]
*  So if you think about that world that you were just describing as one we don't want a [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1927.3s)]
*  second ago, where you have 25 kids in a class, they're all staring at a screen. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1931.1s)]
*  They're all working with an individualized AI tutor. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1936.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1939.78s)]
*  You could imagine a world if you think about every one of those screens as a junior [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1940.74s)]
*  teacher, as an individual tutor, that there's some master teacher in the room who the kids [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1946.1s)]
*  can go talk to, who can be pulled in to sort of oversee the learning, to reshape what's [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1950.5s)]
*  happening. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1955.58s)]
*  There is testing. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1956.74s)]
*  There are things that are trying to help us evaluate how the kids are doing. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1957.82s)]
*  But the teacher who's already managing a classroom of students is now also in a way [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1961.3s)]
*  managing a classroom of helpers, of tutors. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1967.3799999999999s)]
*  I think that would be the kind of vision you would hear from the more AI-pilled among us. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1972.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1979.1s)]
*  The role of the teacher in traditional public schools is damn near impossible. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1980.3000000000002s)]
*  Honestly, they have to master a certain subject. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1988.78s)]
*  They have to get kids to grade level. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1992.26s)]
*  So if you have, and usually we have a wide difference of grade levels in school between [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=1996.1000000000001s)]
*  three and four different grade levels. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2001.78s)]
*  So they've got to differentiate and figure out who needs what, the board kid, who's the [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2003.42s)]
*  passenger, the struggling kid, who's also the passenger, both of them silent and quiet [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2007.26s)]
*  and you don't even know. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2010.42s)]
*  And they've got to manage classroom dynamics. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2012.74s)]
*  Like kids have to not hit each other or disrupt each other or ruin the furniture. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2015.5s)]
*  And they have to increasingly be social workers. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2022.5400000000002s)]
*  Kids are not doing well, lots of mental health problems. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2027.74s)]
*  They've got to spot that. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2030.5400000000002s)]
*  They've got to help it. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2031.18s)]
*  They also have to be relationship managers. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2032.3000000000002s)]
*  They've got to work with parents, et cetera. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2034.02s)]
*  So it's very hard for one teacher to do this all. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2035.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2040.26s)]
*  I think the wave of the future is a different model where you have multiple people and one [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2041.18s)]
*  of those could be an AI tutor helping support our kids growth and development. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2047.1s)]
*  The interaction with AI can help with skill development, knowledge acquisition. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2054.42s)]
*  But that is one slice of what happens in a classroom. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2062.2200000000003s)]
*  And it is one slice of what it really means for kids to be educated. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2066.1800000000003s)]
*  Kids are learning all sorts of things in a classroom. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2069.94s)]
*  They're learning how to self-regulate emotions in a group. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2073.78s)]
*  They're learning how to understand different perspectives from kids who are different from [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2077.34s)]
*  themselves. They're learning, you know, how to ask for help when they need it. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2081.1s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of things that kids are kids are learning that is much more person [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2088.1800000000003s)]
*  to person that we want to maintain, I would argue. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2093.86s)]
*  Here's where I actually am. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2097.38s)]
*  I think we've just been going through a catastrophic experiment with screens and children. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2100.78s)]
*  And right now, I think we are starting to figure out that this was a bad idea and schools [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2107.94s)]
*  are banning phones. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2114.42s)]
*  My sense is that they are not relying very much on laptops and iPads. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2116.78s)]
*  There's a big vogue for a while of every kid gets their own laptop or tablet. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2120.9s)]
*  I think that's beginning to go away if I'm reading the tea leaves of this, right? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2125.82s)]
*  And so I feel a bit better about that as a parent of young kids. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2130.42s)]
*  I really feel badly for the parents whose kids have been navigating this over the past [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2134.1400000000003s)]
*  10 or 15, 10 years, let's call it. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2141.1800000000003s)]
*  And right now, I see AI coming and I don't think we understand it at all. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2143.62s)]
*  I don't think we understand how to teach with it. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2147.54s)]
*  I don't think the studies we're doing right now are good studies yet. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2149.8199999999997s)]
*  There are too many other effects we're not going to be measuring. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2153.1s)]
*  I think there's the sort of narrow thing that a program does and then what it does for a [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2155.8599999999997s)]
*  kid to be staring at a screen all the time in a deeper way. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2159.94s)]
*  I believe human beings are embodied. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2163.18s)]
*  And if you made me choose between sending my kids to a school that has no screens at [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2165.8199999999997s)]
*  all and one that is trying the latest in AI technology, I would send them to school with [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2169.14s)]
*  no screens at all in a second. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2171.94s)]
*  But we're going to be working through this somehow. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2175.38s)]
*  And what scares me, putting aside what world my kids graduate into, is them moving into [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2179.7400000000002s)]
*  schools at the exact time that they don't know what the hell to do with this technology. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2185.14s)]
*  And they're about to try a lot of things that don't work and probably try it badly. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2189.34s)]
*  And I wonder, as somebody who's tracked this, what you think is the most important thing [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2193.1800000000003s)]
*  and I wonder, as somebody who's tracked this, what you think the lessons of what I consider, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2196.7s)]
*  at least, the screens and phones debacle of the 2010s or the 2000s have been. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2201.98s)]
*  I agree with you 100 percent. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2210.58s)]
*  It was a massive, uncontrolled experiment. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2213.18s)]
*  And our kids were the guinea pigs. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2217.62s)]
*  We just had a wait and see approach. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2219.58s)]
*  We cannot take a wait and see approach again. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2221.14s)]
*  And I think that there's lots of lessons. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2223.1s)]
*  I would say, first off, do not use generative AI unless you really know what you're using it for. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2225.58s)]
*  There is a real sense of FOMO among educators, parents, young people even, that there's this [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2235.2200000000003s)]
*  thing happening out there and I should use it because it's the newest thing. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2244.5s)]
*  I saw that with groups who were working on student well-being and they had done teacher [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2248.78s)]
*  training around well-being curriculum for teachers and they said, oh, we need to train [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2254.66s)]
*  parents how to do it. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2259.1s)]
*  So their idea was, let's use generative AI. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2259.8999999999996s)]
*  It'll be great because parents also do need to reinforce well-being messages that teachers [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2262.74s)]
*  are giving in school, which is true. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2268.2999999999997s)]
*  And what we'll do is we'll create an app. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2270.2599999999998s)]
*  And so this is what they had suggested. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2272.02s)]
*  Ezra, imagine you sitting down around the dinner table. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2275.22s)]
*  You pull up your phone and you have an app and your kids have their phone and you say, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2278.46s)]
*  OK, how are you feeling today? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2283.62s)]
*  And you're looking at your phone and they're telling you how they feel. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2285.46s)]
*  And then you click through and ask, why are you feeling that way? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2289.38s)]
*  Like mediated through a phone. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2292.98s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2294.2999999999997s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2295.06s)]
*  Like we've lost our mind. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2295.98s)]
*  Like that we need AI to talk to our kids. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2297.98s)]
*  So if there's not a real problem you're trying to solve, don't use it is number one. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2300.7799999999997s)]
*  Number two, any I really do believe this. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2306.74s)]
*  Any company that wants to work with kids in schools should be a benefit corporation [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2310.14s)]
*  because legally you have a lot of companies who are creating perhaps really good stuff [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2315.8599999999997s)]
*  if used well that they have to maximize profits. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2321.8999999999996s)]
*  They can't maximize social benefit and well-being. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2326.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, one thing that worries me is the way in which this might maybe already has been [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2329.86s)]
*  widen the inequality between parents who can pay for private schools and parents who can't. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2336.82s)]
*  And what I mean by that is that private schools can just adapt more quickly. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2344.82s)]
*  They are not dealing with they don't have to go through legislatures and have the boards [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2350.1s)]
*  and they're just a little bit more independent. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2355.34s)]
*  They can take the screens out. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2358.42s)]
*  They can put them in. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2359.66s)]
*  They can limit what comes in. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2360.3399999999997s)]
*  Whereas the public school systems tend to be somewhat more slow moving. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2361.9s)]
*  I just knew living out in the Bay Area, a lot of tech people who are paying money to send [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2365.7s)]
*  their kids to private schools that had banned the products they made starting many years [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2372.86s)]
*  ago and the rest of everybody were sending them to public schools that had not done that. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2378.86s)]
*  And when things are very, very fast moving, being able to be fast moving is really important. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2384.06s)]
*  So somebody who cares a lot about public education, what should the orientation of the [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2388.2999999999997s)]
*  public schools be? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2392.94s)]
*  How do they sort of not seem to parents who think there's something that their kids should [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2394.94s)]
*  be getting out of this? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2399.38s)]
*  Don't the kids need to know how to use AI? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2400.14s)]
*  So they're going to need to attract parents on that level. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2402.98s)]
*  But also, how do they not end up flat footed if this is turning out to be a disaster? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2406.22s)]
*  This is a really tricky question. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2413.1s)]
*  And you point on something that is a real issue, which is around the deep equity issues [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2414.62s)]
*  that have already emerged. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2421.54s)]
*  So think about the schools that ban AI for a kid who has no access to AI at home versus [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2423.94s)]
*  a kid who goes home and has full access to all the AI tools. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2434.22s)]
*  That right there is a huge cleavage in our country. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2439.3399999999997s)]
*  It also, there's a huge equity gap in terms of language. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2443.9399999999996s)]
*  Large language models work off of language that is written down. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2452.14s)]
*  There's a lot of languages that aren't written down that much. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2458.8599999999997s)]
*  They have very little written down. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2462.4199999999996s)]
*  And so there you're seeing a global gap across the globe. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2465.18s)]
*  Between sort of African and indigenous languages and communities versus English speaking or [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2468.7s)]
*  other large languages. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2474.3799999999997s)]
*  So there is, equity is a huge one. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2476.14s)]
*  Your question about sort of public versus private, I would say to public education systems, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2479.7799999999997s)]
*  do not have FOMO because that is what the gut instinct is when a new technology comes. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2485.7s)]
*  I'm missing out. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2493.2599999999998s)]
*  I have a fear of missing out and I need to adopt it. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2494.54s)]
*  And I see this. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2497.1s)]
*  So don't have FOMO. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2499.14s)]
*  Don't use it unless it's a real problem you want to solve. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2500.3s)]
*  Do give it to the adults in the school building. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2503.2599999999998s)]
*  Give it to teachers. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2506.66s)]
*  Have them use it and figure out how it will help them today. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2507.54s)]
*  Then give it to sort of really novel school leaders to think about how they could maybe [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2512.06s)]
*  restructure the teaching and learning experiences. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2516.9s)]
*  What are the things that AI can do? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2519.98s)]
*  There's so much that AI could actually do to help make public schools work better. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2522.9s)]
*  Bus schedules, calendaring, school meals, cafeteria. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2528.98s)]
*  I mean, you know, assessment input. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2532.7000000000003s)]
*  There's so much time that could be really freed up. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2535.46s)]
*  Let me try to sharpen the FOMO argument or the argument that will be used to give people FOMO. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2539.1400000000003s)]
*  The argument goes something like this. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2543.7000000000003s)]
*  If AI is a very potent technology that's going to be integrated into virtually everything in [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2546.46s)]
*  the future, not literally everything, but quite a lot, then not just your literacy, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2551.3s)]
*  but your competency in it becomes paramount. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2556.94s)]
*  You're not going to be replaced by an AI. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2561.1400000000003s)]
*  You're going to be replaced by a person who knows how to use AI. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2563.54s)]
*  And so what you need to learn is to use the AI. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2567.7000000000003s)]
*  You need to learn how to manage it, how to prompt it, a sense of what it can and can't do. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2571.46s)]
*  And there's no way to do that other than relentless familiarity and experimentation. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2576.38s)]
*  And exposure. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2581.86s)]
*  And so a kid who goes to some Luddite school or when they're young, the toys are made out of wood. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2583.86s)]
*  And when they're older, the books are all printed on paper and there's not a gen AI in sight. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2590.7400000000002s)]
*  It's going to lose out. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2597.02s)]
*  And it will be like having not taught them mathematics, right. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2598.98s)]
*  Or having not taught them how to drive or something of that or how to type. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2603.3s)]
*  Right. How do you take that argument? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2607.2200000000003s)]
*  I think it is 50 percent right. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2609.5s)]
*  And I think the 50 percent depends on the age of the child. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2613.98s)]
*  I absolutely 100 percent think you should send your kids to the Waldorf school with the wood blocks. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2617.5s)]
*  And when they're young, you know, we know that kids early childhood, the more screen time they have, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2623.58s)]
*  the less language acquisition they have. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2631.98s)]
*  We know that, you know, babies, when you're when infants are learning language, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2634.18s)]
*  they learn a lot of language from human to human contact. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2641.8199999999997s)]
*  And when if you put the same sentences on a screen, they don't learn it. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2647.2599999999998s)]
*  Our neurobiology is not going to change in five years. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2652.8999999999996s)]
*  So we have to work with that's the only confines I think we really have to work within [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2657.98s)]
*  everything else I think we can be imagined. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2661.54s)]
*  But it's true that when kids get older and you do want to teach literacy, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2664.18s)]
*  when kids understand this is true for social media, too, when kids sort of learn about, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2671.3799999999997s)]
*  oh, these big companies are, you know, trying to addict me there. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2675.7s)]
*  I'm doing it for free, but I get, you know, with my attention and staying on it longer is how they make money. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2681.2599999999998s)]
*  You get you tell that to teenagers. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2690.94s)]
*  Actually, there's been great research on this and they get pissed off. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2692.38s)]
*  I think we need to do the same with AI literacy. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2695.6600000000003s)]
*  Like, this is how it works. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2697.7000000000003s)]
*  It's not some magical thing. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2698.9s)]
*  It's not another human being. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2700.34s)]
*  So when kids get older, we need to teach them about that. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2701.98s)]
*  And then they need when they get older, they need to start playing with it, playing with it, using it. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2705.3s)]
*  But my huge caveat is with AI that is designed for kids. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2710.2200000000003s)]
*  Right now, there is a spring fling race by the large AI labs to get students to sign up. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2715.9399999999996s)]
*  You've got chat GPT giving two months free of GPT plus. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2726.62s)]
*  Then you got XAI come in two months free for Super Grok and then Google not to be out done is like, well, you can get a month. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2732.8199999999997s)]
*  You can get a year free and I'll give you two terabytes of storage. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2741.18s)]
*  And these are largely for college students and Google just made Gemini available for kids through through parents with family plan. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2744.22s)]
*  And they are racing to get allegiance of young kids. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2753.58s)]
*  This is terrible because those products are not designed for children and for learning. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2759.74s)]
*  I guess then there is to go back to your equity point. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2767.22s)]
*  There's the argument from the opposite direction in equity. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2771.22s)]
*  Which is that it is the kids with the least access to all kinds of enrichment materials to tutors. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2775.22s)]
*  I mean, we know what rich kids in urban centers get and then what you're getting. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2786.14s)]
*  I mean, you know, in parts of America that are rural and don't yet have broadband or don't have wide access to broadband to say nothing of, you know, a kid in Nigeria, in rural Nigeria. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2792.2599999999998s)]
*  That that is where at least a well structured Gen. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2804.22s)]
*  AI tutor might be able to make a difference really fast. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2809.3399999999997s)]
*  You've talked a bit about a study in Nigeria that I never quite know how to how seriously to take these studies yet. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2814.4599999999996s)]
*  But why don't you say what it what it did and what it found. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2824.02s)]
*  So I think that AI has real potential for very specific use cases, particularly around access gaps. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2827.58s)]
*  And in Nigeria, what was done was after school twice a week, an AI tutor helped kids learn English. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2835.58s)]
*  And it was for six weeks, which is not long. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2845.58s)]
*  It was June, July, I think, was a randomized controlled trial. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2848.58s)]
*  We're still waiting for all the evidence to come through. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2852.58s)]
*  But point three standard deviations, which is pretty good, equivalent to maybe two years of average sort of English learning. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2855.02s)]
*  And, you know, we see that difference with other technologies, too. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2862.06s)]
*  It doesn't have to be Gen. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2867.5s)]
*  AI. It can be rule based AI. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2868.42s)]
*  It could be predictive AI. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2871.14s)]
*  We've seen sort of similar benefits, for example, in Malawi teaching literacy and numeracy to kids with offline tablets, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2872.94s)]
*  where teachers have maybe 80 to 100 kids in a class and each kid is having sort of personalized adaptive learning experience. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2881.38s)]
*  That is hugely beneficial as well. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2892.1s)]
*  So that's one use case. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2895.02s)]
*  Another use case that I think is really great is neurodivergent kids. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2897.94s)]
*  Super helpful. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2902.98s)]
*  There's all sorts of kids that have different learning differences that struggle in school. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2904.94s)]
*  Don't have access to the specialists that they need that would benefit greatly from, you know, being in a classroom where they could have a little assistant to help them navigate. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2910.46s)]
*  We I see my my youngest son has dyslexia and they sort of read and write text to speech to text has been game changing for him. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2924.38s)]
*  There's also use cases here in the US. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2932.1400000000003s)]
*  You see AI being used and experimented around supporting wellness advisors who kind of fill the gap for school counselors in rural school districts, for example, where they don't have school counselors, which is actually an actual person. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2934.1s)]
*  But AI is boosting that person's ability to have a helpful conversation with a kid. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2951.22s)]
*  And it's bringing through tech mental health resource into a community that didn't have one. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2957.1s)]
*  So there's lots of use cases, actually, if done well, contained well, designed well. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2962.82s)]
*  And we have adult, you know, we humans have our hand on the steering wheel. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2969.82s)]
*  Ethan Malik, who's an AI expert, he's got this idea that has been influential for me about the best available human is AI better for you in a certain purpose, not in the best human, but the best human available to you at a given moment. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2974.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2990.1400000000003s)]
*  Yes, having a professional excellent editor like my editor at the New York Times would be better. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2990.58s)]
*  But most people don't have that available. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2994.9s)]
*  So AI is better than the best available editor to them. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=2996.8199999999997s)]
*  There's a lot more demand for therapy than there are therapists. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3000.62s)]
*  So oftentimes, AI is, you know, and practically where it's going, even for me, sometimes it's a better therapist than the best available therapist I have available at a given moment. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3003.98s)]
*  It certainly seems plausibly true in education, too. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3014.2599999999998s)]
*  There's all kinds of times when you are confused by what you are reading, what you are learning. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3018.34s)]
*  And you're in a big class and it's embarrassing to ask 55 questions or there's even time to ask 55 questions and you don't want to seem stupid. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3025.54s)]
*  But if you could contain the system somehow. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3034.5s)]
*  And that seems more plausible here where there's a fundamental prompt at the core of them. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3038.26s)]
*  Then, you know, if we got that right, it did. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3043.6600000000003s)]
*  And a lot of these use cases, it could be really. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3047.42s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3050.6600000000003s)]
*  And the key is what you said, contain the system. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3051.6600000000003s)]
*  We can't sort of just bring commercial tech into our schools and hope it will solve these problems. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3054.6600000000003s)]
*  It has to have guardrails. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3060.86s)]
*  We have to make sure that the data that's it's being trained on is legit and not going to create harmful prompts for kids. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3062.6600000000003s)]
*  We've seen terrible things with commercial AI companions, with young young people, you know, developing relationships and being, you know, really manipulated emotionally. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3070.02s)]
*  But you can put guardrails. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3081.1s)]
*  It's totally possible. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3082.58s)]
*  It's just where who what the frankly gets back to the incentives. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3085.54s)]
*  It gets back to the business model, which is where you know, regulation and government could and should step in. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3090.58s)]
*  So, yes, if contained is the question. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3099.26s)]
*  So then let me ask you about the other impulse somebody might have, which is not that you're going to be replaced by somebody who knows how to use AI, but that in a world where we have AI's, the most important thing for human beings to be is as human as possible. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3103.0200000000004s)]
*  And that what we need to do is return to more classical education. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3118.7000000000003s)]
*  That what we need to do is be reading the great books, developing the attentional faculties that a lot of data and anecdotes suggest that even very elite students are losing to read a long book and think about it, to write a long essay, to be educated in the way that was considered high civilization education. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3125.1s)]
*  70 years ago, and you might get at a St. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3152.54s)]
*  John's or a U of Chicago or certain private schools today. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3154.86s)]
*  But actually, what we should do is retreat somewhat. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3159.7s)]
*  School should be a place not where we learn how to partner with machines, because the rest of society is going to tell you how to do that. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3163.86s)]
*  School should be a place where we develop specifically human faculties such that we are capable and flexible and attentive in moving through a world that we just cannot predict. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3170.78s)]
*  We 100% want kids to have the capacity for deep attention. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3185.34s)]
*  And you're thinking about your own kiddos who are young. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3189.5800000000004s)]
*  And I'm thinking about my own teenagers who are 13 and 16. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3193.3s)]
*  And I see the undermining of attentive faculties from when my 16 year old got his phone. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3198.02s)]
*  For a long time, he didn't want a phone because I'd been droning on and on for years because he has me as a mother about addiction and opportunity costs and just that, you know, it's okay to enjoy it a little bit, but you know, can't sacrifice sleep and physical exercise and in person, you know, communication. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3209.5800000000004s)]
*  And then he did get his phone and he struggles with it. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3227.22s)]
*  And he says, Mom, this is really hard. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3230.26s)]
*  Like it's eroding his ability to do his homework or to follow something he wants to do. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3232.14s)]
*  The only thing that it doesn't seem to distract him from doing is playing the piano because he loves playing the piano. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3240.26s)]
*  So anything that we can do to actually ensure young people are developing the muscle, and it's not just attention. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3244.8999999999996s)]
*  Attention is the entry point. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3256.18s)]
*  That's the doorway that gets you through. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3258.3799999999997s)]
*  It's actually reflection and meaning making, which is what you get from deep reading and reading full books, which a lot of young people struggle to do today. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3260.5s)]
*  You also can get it from other means. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3272.2999999999997s)]
*  You could get it from long Socratic dialogues in community with diverse people over time, but it has to be an experience where you reflect. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3274.46s)]
*  You think about meaning, you think about different perspectives and it changes how you see the world. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3286.5s)]
*  But what do you think about this idea that school should be a rare screen free oasis in a child's life? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3293.78s)]
*  I've sometimes imagined a school that I could send my kids to. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3303.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying it exists just in my head. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3308.0600000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3309.9s)]
*  Where what they do is they go in and somebody is watching them and helping them read books and think through math. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3311.02s)]
*  And there's long periods and they have a certain amount of exploratory capacity in that. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3320.66s)]
*  You can choose between different books. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3325.5s)]
*  But the idea that maybe one space in their life would just be a place that is trying to encourage in them that capacity for meaning making, for deep attention, for deep contemplation. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3327.94s)]
*  It seems to me to be more valuable than it seems to be to other people to just have a teacher sit there and watch kids read. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3344.22s)]
*  For an hour and a half at a time. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3351.02s)]
*  And then there's a discussion. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3353.66s)]
*  Than to do a lot of what we do in school. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3356.06s)]
*  And so this idea of schools is as explicitly counter to the trends of the moment because they need to develop things that the moment will not naturally develop. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3358.46s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3368.2999999999997s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3369.2599999999998s)]
*  I actually think if I had to choose for my own kids, and I do, we would have a school that has no phones. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3370.66s)]
*  For all the reasons we know, and Jonathan Haidt has done a great job on, you know, sort of catalyzing that movement here in the US and bringing it from across the globe to our schools. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3380.8199999999997s)]
*  I think today we should have cell phone bands in school, bell to bell. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3391.58s)]
*  Don't have it at recess because that's where you start interacting and playing with kids. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3396.2999999999997s)]
*  And I think we should make school a place where kids can actually interact with each other. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3402.78s)]
*  Have developed human to human socialization capacities because there is massive commercial tech the minute they leave school. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3413.7400000000002s)]
*  That is vying for their attention and coming for them and make sure, make sure to do some high quality AI literacy. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3422.86s)]
*  AI literacy is way, way different than using AI to learn. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3430.34s)]
*  AI literacy is what is this? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3437.26s)]
*  How was it made? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3440.5s)]
*  What are the risks? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3442.9s)]
*  What are the benefits? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3444.02s)]
*  And let's talk about what, how our ethics around this new tool and how to incorporate it into our lives. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3445.02s)]
*  You know, with an adult instructor talking about how it works and what it is. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3452.0600000000004s)]
*  I think that would, that's AI literacy and that's important. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3457.0600000000004s)]
*  I hope you're right. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3461.3s)]
*  I've been in general, very skeptical of how much literacy will do. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3462.38s)]
*  But I guess this goes back to the point you were making about. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3467.3s)]
*  I mean, there is a question how much we will do, but your question is, will it make a difference? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3469.3s)]
*  I'm as, I'm as phone literate as I think you can almost be. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3474.3s)]
*  I've been writing about this for years. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3478.54s)]
*  Yep. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3480.54s)]
*  I'm functionally extremist on this issue. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3481.02s)]
*  And still the only way for me to modulate my own use to the point I would like to is to use a device that hobbles my phone, the brick, every time I touch it to the RFID chip. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3484.34s)]
*  And if I don't do that, all the literacy in the world, I've known John Height for many, many years. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3496.54s)]
*  He's been on this show. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3501.86s)]
*  I've read the ancient generation. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3502.86s)]
*  It doesn't do me that much good because that's just not how the brain works. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3505.42s)]
*  Any more than knowing that I shouldn't eat so many Oreos keeps you from eating them if they're on the table in front of me. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3510.74s)]
*  And I think you bring something up that's really important, which is, you know, these things need to be regulated. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3516.18s)]
*  It's ridiculous that they're out there being used by kids. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3522.46s)]
*  Like, and it's ridiculous to say, Ezra, it's your willpower that should be the deciding factor. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3526.06s)]
*  It's ridiculous for adults. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3531.94s)]
*  It's ridiculous for kids. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3533.2599999999998s)]
*  These are incredibly seductive technologies. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3534.58s)]
*  So, you know, this is this is a really tough one for me around because you do want kids to be fluent in the new technology of the time. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3537.46s)]
*  And you do want them to have an ethics and awareness about it. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3548.54s)]
*  You don't want them to be seduced by it. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3551.54s)]
*  The large AI labs are perfectly capable, perfectly capable, if they wanted to, of creating a gen AI product that is designed for kids that will not [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3554.66s)]
*  be as seductive. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3567.18s)]
*  It's interesting. I was just thinking about that and I wonder, I think they are. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3569.94s)]
*  But I also wouldn't overstate how well they even understand what it is they are doing. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3575.06s)]
*  They don't fully understand the systems they're making now. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3582.54s)]
*  The kids are more, I mean, relentlessly, the kids are more capable and ingenious than, you know, the eight or 40 or 100 developers on any given [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3586.02s)]
*  When you're building something that has a small number of hundreds of people building it and then it's used by 40,000 kids, I think our experience is that they are clever in ways typically that you are not. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3596.78s)]
*  I do think that over time we can create things that are that are curbed. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3609.98s)]
*  It's just that I'm not sure we even know exactly what we are targeting. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3613.82s)]
*  What we are creating. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3618.1000000000004s)]
*  Well, I would say they're they have to change how they're developing the products. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3619.2200000000003s)]
*  You can't create an AI that'll be great for kids and teachers and teaching and learning without having teachers and kids and education experts and child development experts in the development process with you. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3624.54s)]
*  And so few are. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3637.8199999999997s)]
*  So I think about what the Dutch government is doing. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3639.62s)]
*  They're doing a partnership with sort of the teacher unions and the academics and the tech companies. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3644.58s)]
*  And they're having a little lab to figure out how to, you know, what would I look like in in schools. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3650.06s)]
*  But any of that sort of bottom up experimentation is is a way to go before you roll it out. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3655.98s)]
*  Because most AI developers, although they might be good people, they're not child development specialists. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3661.86s)]
*  But if they change the way they develop their products, they could. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3667.9s)]
*  So I want to go back to where we began, which is, you know, you've got young kids now. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3672.2599999999998s)]
*  They're going to be going into school in the age of Gen. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3677.02s)]
*  A.I. How should you think about their schooling? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3679.46s)]
*  So we can't really predict the shape of society in 15 or 20 years. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3682.02s)]
*  I don't think that's a question we could answer on the show. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3686.9s)]
*  If we could, we should probably be investing, not podcasting. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3689.94s)]
*  But what we have in education now is constant markers that are supposed to tell us as parents how well our kids education is going. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3694.54s)]
*  And that's basically grades and maybe to some degree counselor reports. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3706.86s)]
*  And the idea is if they get good grades and they seem happy and well adjusted, then at the end of that process, they'll go to a good college or go to a trade school and get a good job. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3711.94s)]
*  And it's going to be a pretty straight line. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3721.5s)]
*  All A's equal good job. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3723.06s)]
*  The future is foggier. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3726.42s)]
*  What they will need to know is maybe a little foggier. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3728.1400000000003s)]
*  What then should a parent be trying to watch in the meantime? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3731.2200000000003s)]
*  How do you think about whether or not your kid's education is going well? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3736.46s)]
*  If you're a little suspicious that the grades designed for and maybe even not that well designed for the society we have had are not going to correlate all that well to the society we will have. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3740.7s)]
*  And I think as a parent, you yourself, but also other parents out there are right to be suspicious because I think that linear line is going to be much more complicated as the years go on with AI in our world. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3757.26s)]
*  So what I would think about is a couple of things. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3772.1400000000003s)]
*  One, getting back to the research I've done with my co-author and colleague Jenny Anderson. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3775.7799999999997s)]
*  Grades don't show you how much kids are engaged. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3781.14s)]
*  Schools are not designed to give kids agency. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3788.18s)]
*  Schools are designed to help kids comply. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3791.7s)]
*  And it's actually not really the fault of the teacher. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3795.4599999999996s)]
*  Teachers are squished from above with all sorts of standards and squished from below with parents, you know, putting a lot of pressure on, you know, teachers about their kids performance and outcome. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3799.54s)]
*  And what you really want is some feedback loops that are beyond just grades and behavior, like to know is my kid developing agency over their learning. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3810.7s)]
*  And what I mean by that is, are they able to reflect and think about things they're learning in a way that they can identify what's interesting and they can have the skills to pursue new information that right there. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3822.3s)]
*  Is, I think, going to be the core skill. It is the core skill for learning new things in an uncertain world, which is, I think, one of the number one things we think about. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3837.66s)]
*  In addition to that, I would say, make sure kids are learning to interact with other human beings. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3846.8199999999997s)]
*  Any school that has them working with peers, but even connecting with community members, our social networks are getting smaller. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3855.54s)]
*  There's going to be a premium on human to human interaction as more and more skills get automated and done by AI, which are the more knowledge sort of cognitive tasks. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3862.8599999999997s)]
*  The sort of interpersonal caregiving teaching, you know, skills are going to continue to be important for some for some time. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3875.5s)]
*  I'm not sure for how long, but for some time. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3882.8599999999997s)]
*  And then the last thing, which may seem silly to you, but I increasingly keep thinking about is think about speaking. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3885.3399999999997s)]
*  Listening and speaking as the missing piece of literacy alongside reading and writing. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3893.7799999999997s)]
*  We're going to need to show our merit and our sort of credentials more and more through what the British call oracy skills. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3901.46s)]
*  You know, I think we've lost the art of listening and speaking. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3913.7s)]
*  I think that's a good place to end. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3919.8599999999997s)]
*  Thank you for speaking and listening with me. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3921.5s)]
*  Always a final question. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3924.06s)]
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3925.42s)]
*  So the first one is Democracy in Education by John Dewey, which is over 100 years old. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3927.2599999999998s)]
*  And we are now seeing through lots of great neuroscience that his observations around the teaching and learning experience and what makes for a good teaching and learning experience were right. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3935.1s)]
*  He has some great discussions around the importance of reflection, not just ingesting knowledge, but reflecting on it, making meaning, figuring out how to do things with it. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3948.5s)]
*  And I love it because, you know, we didn't talk about this as much, but the role of schools in our society are more than just your and my kids education and getting a job, even though that's what we care about most as a parent. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3957.8199999999997s)]
*  They are about creating a democratic society or not. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3971.8199999999997s)]
*  So that's an oldie but goodie. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQtaWgIQmE&t=3976.82s)]
