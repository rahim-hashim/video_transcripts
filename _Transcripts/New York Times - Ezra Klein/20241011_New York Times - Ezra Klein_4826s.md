Video Description: In his new book of essays, “The Message (https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/653438/the-message-by-ta-nehisi-coates/) ,” Ta-Nehisi Coates writes about a trip he took to Israel and the West Bank in May 2023. “I felt lied to,” he told me. “I felt lied to by my craft. I felt lied to by major media organizations.”


Coates’s essay is a searing portrait of Palestinian life under Israeli rule. It has also been criticized for leaving much out: Hamas is never mentioned. Nor is Oct. 7. Nor are any of the peace processes. So I asked him on the show to discuss what he saw when he was there and what he chose to leave outside the frame.

# Ta-Nehisi Coates on Israel ‘I Felt Lied To.’
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg77CiqQSYk)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  In Ta-Nehisi Coates' new book, The Message, he writes of a trip he took to Israel and
*  the West Bank in May of 2023.
*  The Message is composed of four different essays.
*  One is about a trip to Senegal, one is about a trip to a place where his book was banned.
*  But it is the essay about Coates' time in the West Bank that really anchors the collection.
*  Coates, by virtue of who he is, cannot write a book about Israel and the Palestinians without
*  it becoming a major media and even ideological event.
*  But his own project, as he tells it, was to go to this place that he had grown up hearing
*  about.
*  This place that he had been told was too complicated for him to understand, and to figure out what
*  he thought of it, to take seriously what he would see.
*  And what he saw shocked him.
*  This book has been criticized for not being a whole picture, and it's not a whole picture.
*  There is much that is left out, even on the Palestinian side, that I think could be there,
*  should be there.
*  We talk about that.
*  At the same time, when I went to the West Bank, what Coates saw is what I saw too.
*  Compared to other things you can read, I think Coates' rendering of how Israel and Palestinians
*  got here, I think it leaves a lot out.
*  But his rendering of where he is, at least for Palestinians living in the places he visited,
*  is a lot sharper and less clouded than most of what I've seen.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at nytimes.com.
*  Ta-Nehisi Coates, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks for having me back, Ezra.
*  So a lot of the book here is about stories.
*  So before you went to Israel, before you went to the West Bank, what was the story of the
*  region, the conflict, the deals of people that you felt you knew?
*  I grew up in this activist tradition, this black activist tradition, where things were
*  kind of said, but the knowledge was not like empirical, always footnoted.
*  It was the Israelis are doing something bad to the Palestinians, and the Palestinians
*  are basically the blacks in that situation.
*  That's a rough translation of it.
*  It probably would have been, they took the Palestinians' land.
*  It would have been crude like that.
*  And then you go out into the world, and you see that politics in general are just more
*  complicated, period, right?
*  You know what I mean?
*  You see things need to be cited, footnoted.
*  And then I came into journalism, and this is the story I tell in the book.
*  And I don't think I'm going to be able to say this anywhere else but here.
*  But journalism, like, it solved.
*  I was looking for something.
*  I was looking for a way to pursue knowledge in the world.
*  And I found this field where if you pick up the phone and you say, I'm from here, people
*  actually answer your questions.
*  Isn't it a miracle?
*  It is a miracle.
*  I couldn't believe it.
*  When you get to a place like the Atlantic, you have resources behind you.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So all of these, you know, maybe academic papers that you wanted to read that you couldn't
*  get access to, suddenly you have access to them.
*  You suddenly have time to read books.
*  You know what I mean?
*  In a way that you didn't before because they're paying you, at least in my case they were
*  paying me, you know, a decent rate.
*  And so like this opening happened.
*  But I think what also happened was the fact of the field at that period in time meant
*  that generally the kind of person that was going to be in the kind of journalism that
*  I wanted to practice was probably going to have a certain set of politics, not just around
*  Israel and Palestine, but in general.
*  And I'm still, even though I published the book, I'm still working my way through this,
*  right?
*  So you have to forgive me if I'm thinking even now.
*  But what I would say is I think there was kind of a default Zionism, a hum, you know,
*  that was just kind of around me.
*  It was not explicitly stated often.
*  It's not particularly profane.
*  But when I went to write the case of reparations and I wrote that section about using the state
*  of Israel as an analog for black America, nobody questioned it.
*  Nobody.
*  And for people who haven't read it, what you say is that there were reparations from Germany
*  to the Jews.
*  Actually, to the state of Israel.
*  Yes, it's important to distinguish between that, right?
*  Specifically to the state.
*  That story comes out.
*  It's, you know, very, very well received.
*  It's probably, you know, the most well received piece of journalism I've ever written.
*  But there's a dissent.
*  And the dissent was you are using this as an example, but it actually undercuts the
*  morality of reparations.
*  And I thought about that for a really, really long time.
*  So what leads you to visit?
*  Who invites you?
*  When do you go?
*  Who takes you around?
*  In 2016, the Palestine Festival of Literature invited me.
*  I wanted to go there.
*  It didn't work out.
*  I think maybe I was working on We Were Eight Years in Power or whatever.
*  Signed up to go like maybe two years later.
*  Broke my toe.
*  Couldn't not go.
*  It was a lot of walking, so I'm glad I didn't try to go.
*  COVID happens.
*  Couldn't go there.
*  And then after COVID, I reached out to the people that run it.
*  I said, I really think I got to get here.
*  I really think I have to get here.
*  I got to get this figured out.
*  It's a scary thing to go.
*  I was scared to go.
*  I was very, very scared to go.
*  But in short-
*  Just to clear emotionally.
*  Emotionally.
*  It wasn't like I think something's going to happen to me.
*  But I thought there was, I had a vague sense that there was a chance that I was going to
*  see something that I would not be able to come back and act like I just didn't see.
*  You were there for 10 days?
*  I was there 10 days.
*  So I was five days with Palestine Powerfest, Palestine Festival of Literature.
*  And the last five, I was mostly hosted by people who were in the orbit of Breaking the
*  Silence.
*  I broke off with them for a couple things myself, for people that I just met that I
*  wanted to spend more time with.
*  For people who don't know, Breaking the Silence is-
*  A group of IDF veterans who opposed the occupation.
*  And they just took me around.
*  They took me around.
*  They took me to talk to a lot of Palestinians.
*  They took me to South Hebron Hills.
*  They took me to the settlement where there is effectively a shrine to Mir Kahani and
*  the grave of Baruch Goldstein is there and it's honored.
*  Baruch Goldstein who's a Jewish terrorist who murdered.
*  Yeah, unloaded, you know, automatic weapon and just shot a bunch of Muslim Palestinians
*  while they were praying.
*  Took me to the South Hebron Hills.
*  And while they're doing this, they are narrating also their time in IDF.
*  I served right there.
*  I was in that house during the second Intifada.
*  This is what I did.
*  This is how I interpreted it at the time.
*  Did you spend any time when you were there with people who I would classify politically
*  as the Israeli right or the Israeli center?
*  You own Breaking the Silence, which is an anti-occupation group with a Palestinian literary festival.
*  Did you go around with anybody who would say, no, we're doing the right thing here or even
*  we're not doing enough here?
*  Um, no.
*  Why?
*  There are things in this world that I see that I just don't want to hear the justification
*  for.
*  I just don't think can be justified.
*  I don't want to hear.
*  I don't know what I can glean from a justification for and I'm talking about in American context,
*  segregation.
*  I don't know what necessarily I can glean from a justification for.
*  If I'm hearing somebody, like interviewing somebody say, tell me why this is legal.
*  Some things come down to, for me, just a moral decision.
*  And I actually think journalists do this all the time.
*  I think we all draw a line somewhere about what we feel is out of bounds and what we
*  feel is beyond.
*  For me, I was willing to entertain probably a debate from people who were anti-occupation,
*  but maybe not necessarily anti-Zionist.
*  Maybe we'd be classified as liberal Zionist even.
*  All the way over to people who thought Zionism was a terrible idea and the worst thing that
*  had ever happened.
*  The justification for settlements was outside of my frame.
*  But that does sort of wipe out all of Israeli society almost, right?
*  I was concerned with what I don't know and what I haven't heard.
*  And for me, Palestinian voices have been pushed so far out of the frame.
*  Like that is the thing that is hard to access.
*  I think this is open for critique, but I made a conscious decision, frankly, in the language,
*  in how that essay is actually written.
*  And even in how I pursued my reporting, to do it from a certain angle.
*  I don't perceive it as a complete survey of settlements, Israeli society, etc.
*  But I was driving through one of the settlements, and I'll never forget this, and I describe
*  it in the book.
*  And we're going through one of the settlements and we're looking out.
*  I see a guard dog, like really, really aggressively yapping.
*  And then I look and I see that he's actually restrained by a cord, right?
*  And then as I look up, I see that there's another cord.
*  Then there's a horizontal cord that is extending straight across.
*  And I follow down that cord, and maybe a few yards later I see another dog on a leash.
*  And as we start driving, that dog starts barking.
*  And then another one, and another one.
*  And then I got told, that's the fence.
*  The dog's on a fence.
*  And it's like, what can justify that?
*  I want to spend some time just in the trip.
*  First day you're there.
*  First day you step foot in the West Bank.
*  What are your first visual impressions of the place?
*  Like, if you went back and wrote in your diary that night, your journal, before you've had
*  time really to process, what is visible to your eye?
*  The signs.
*  Big red signs.
*  The signs essentially saying Palestinians can go here, or Israelis can go here, and
*  Palestinians cannot, or Palestinians can go here and Israelis cannot.
*  You know, I am obviously attuned to see stuff like that.
*  You know, I bring myself with me.
*  The red roofs, which I was then told what that was, you know, and the fact
*  that that actually marked where the settlements were.
*  I always get this mixed up, but basically, I don't think it was the Sistans, but the
*  big water tanks on the roofs.
*  The water tanks are the most indelible sight for me.
*  Yeah.
*  Right, you can tell whether you're going by a Palestinian or Jewish village, city,
*  by whether or not there are water tanks on the roof.
*  Right.
*  Because the Palestinians get less water.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And that was like, so that's my first day on the West Bank.
*  We were driving to Hebron, and then we arrive at Hebron, and there was so much poverty.
*  There are things that I don't even feel comfortable like talking about that I saw,
*  that I just can't say.
*  But we get off the bus, and our guy is taking us through the old city of Hebron,
*  and the soldiers are there, and they're there with their guns, and they are policing
*  our movements, but not to the extent that they're policing our guys' movements,
*  and not to the extent that they are policing the school children who are watching us this morning,
*  trying to get where they're going.
*  And you can see it.
*  You can see the school trying to go down the street, and some guy with a big gun telling
*  some six, seven, eight-year-old, you got to go back this other way.
*  Being stopped when I'm trying to support a vendor there, him asking me my religion,
*  and it being clear that, and here's what's interesting about this.
*  Not that I am a Christian, not that I am a Christian, but either my mother or my
*  grandmother was a Christian.
*  That being the decision for whether I can pass.
*  And I say that to highlight, at that point, that is not a question of whether I have
*  accepted Jesus Christ as my personal savior.
*  That's something deeper.
*  That's something else.
*  That's when you start getting closer to race.
*  What was your mother?
*  What was your grandmother?
*  You write about that.
*  If this had happened in America, I would have told you that the soldier who stopped me was
*  black, and I guess he was here too.
*  Tell me about that line.
*  I mean, to the extent that race is a thing, I guess he was of African ancestry.
*  But I have maintained in almost all of my writing that race is a social construct.
*  And so what we think about as race here did not apply there in the same way.
*  I'm not saying it didn't apply at all.
*  But it is something to see, you know, quote unquote, black through American eyes,
*  quote unquote, black IDF soldiers loitering it over literally blonde and blue-eyed
*  Palestinian children.
*  I saw this.
*  It really didn't start the next day.
*  It was the next day when I really began to say, oh, okay, we went to East Jerusalem.
*  And I was just like, oh, oh, I know what this is.
*  Tell me about East Jerusalem.
*  We went to Al-Aqsa Mosque.
*  We were trying to go to Al-Aqsa Mosque.
*  And I should make this clear about Powfest.
*  I've been asked before by other groups to go.
*  But I told them no.
*  And I told them no because usually very often the request is,
*  we are trying to organize writers to go see this, write something, and then do X, Y, and Z.
*  And I was like, that just is a little too much for me.
*  You can't tell me I have to react X, Y, and Z before I've even seen anything.
*  So they were very good despite having their obvious politics about letting us just see.
*  So they said, okay, we're going to go and we're going to do it the way
*  Palestinian Muslims would do it.
*  We're going to go and try to see this the way they would do it.
*  And we were immediately stopped.
*  And I'm watching people stream out unmolested Americans.
*  And they just leave us there to wait.
*  We're checking X, Y, and Z out.
*  There's a problem with this.
*  It's just, we can do it.
*  And that was immediately familiar.
*  And then I came back a few days later and came as I would if I were an American tourist.
*  And the process was totally seamless.
*  Completely, completely, completely different.
*  Tell me about time there and the way time is used as a tool of humiliation, control, separation.
*  It's not just that on the West Bank there are separate roads.
*  It's that the roads that Palestinians have to take are longer or more circuitous or
*  maybe where you actually have to go is a 30-minute walk.
*  But the way the roads are designed, it turns it into something completely different.
*  And along those roads, you can be stopped at any moment for any reason at all.
*  A checkpoint can appear out of nowhere, a flying checkpoint suddenly.
*  And you're stopped for God knows how long.
*  When I went to the airport when I was leaving, although it was seamless to actually get out,
*  my driver, my cab driver was a Palestinian.
*  And I'm trying to get this right, resident of Jerusalem, which meant he had pretty free.
*  But they stopped that cab.
*  They stopped that cab.
*  And they searched us, asked us for ID and everything.
*  Something that haunts me is towards the end of my trip, there was a dinner
*  of these Breaking the Silence folks.
*  And one of the guys talking about how he was manning a checkpoint and they stopped this
*  Palestinian family, it was a father and a son and maybe somebody else.
*  And they start just searching what he has and the guy has a drum.
*  And they're joking back and forth with the guy and they tell him,
*  hey, why don't you play the drum for us?
*  And the guy plays the drum.
*  And he said, I thought I was joking with that guy.
*  And it's only years later after I realized he was probably terrified.
*  And I immediately thought, man, that dude was probably terrified.
*  When I was scheduling things out there, I'd have these days I was going around with Israeli Jews,
*  I'd have these days I was going around with Palestinians, sometimes it'd be
*  inside Green Line Israel, sometimes it'd be in the West Bank.
*  And one of the things that quickly came clear was that scheduling these two kinds of things
*  was really different.
*  The Israeli Jews could get places roughly the way I can here.
*  You know, I mean, you might get caught in traffic, right?
*  But you know, you say like, let's meet up at 8 a.m. or something right there.
*  They're going to be there at 8 a.m.
*  And the Palestinians, it was totally different, right?
*  For no reason, like particularly if they were coming to pick me up inside Green Line Israel,
*  they could just be left there for four hours.
*  There had to be this huge error bar.
*  There had to be this huge error bar.
*  When we were going to meet people, we would go past places and you'd feel everybody tense up.
*  But the flying checkpoint or the particular checkpoint wasn't up that day,
*  or it wasn't manned at that moment.
*  But a week ago, it had been manned.
*  And then they were there for 97 minutes for no particular reason.
*  And there was just the way time existed for the different people I was with,
*  was completely different.
*  The way you could plan out your life.
*  I mean, I'd be talking to people who lived in Ramallah,
*  but they had family, you know, and an elderly mother who lived in another city.
*  And what it would take to plan to go visit their mother was monstrous.
*  A lot of the worst stuff I knew, you know, when I went around.
*  When was the last time you had been there before this trip?
*  It had been, it had been longer than I actually thought.
*  I think I checked this and it was 2009.
*  Had things changed?
*  Was this worse than 2009?
*  Yeah, it was worse.
*  I mean, a lot about it felt differently to me.
*  And it was Israeli society felt very different to me.
*  But I don't think I ever met anybody on either side who was not touched by true violence.
*  It was always so close.
*  I was sitting with an Israeli Jew who owned a winery.
*  And in this particular case, he was, this gun set up for me.
*  This was just sort of shown me like one slice of life.
*  And he was really just trying to sell me on the wines.
*  Right?
*  He was not a very political person in, or at least did not want to be.
*  And they're eating this cheese and I'm like, this is good cheese.
*  And just, he mentions basically offhandedly that the person who made it was killed in,
*  on October 7th and the body was found weeks later.
*  Right?
*  You would trip in to horror, right?
*  All the time.
*  But in some ways, like the horror gets reported.
*  It was the banality.
*  I mean, I knew about the checkpoints, but it was different driving around.
*  I don't think I realized how they just kind of appear and disappear.
*  Right?
*  It was the trash, right?
*  Yeah.
*  The trash on some roads and not others.
*  It was those things.
*  And I, at times I could tell I was almost annoying some of the people I was with
*  because I was getting like obsessed by these like banal questions of public service provision.
*  And they like wanted, like they wanted to tell me about these like true horrors
*  and which I mean, the point was not that I wasn't listening,
*  but it was like that gets out there.
*  It was the, what it's like to move around that I think if most people went there
*  is what they would not be able to morally drop afterwards.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you know, for me, I think about the water.
*  I mean, I know we kind of touched on this.
*  The water is the most.
*  South Aberdeen Hills, we were in a Susia and Tuba, too small.
*  I don't even know what to call them.
*  I mean, they're not quite towns, but basically this was a group of people who had lived in caves.
*  And I hesitate to use that language because of what it conjures and what it looks like
*  is not what it actually conjures.
*  These caves are quite improved.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like they have modeled these caves.
*  Yes.
*  I went here too.
*  Yes.
*  So you know what I mean?
*  You know what I mean?
*  You say cave and you think people are, you know what I mean?
*  And it's not that, but this is an area C.
*  And what they said was they can't get hooked up to the main water network.
*  And that just, I mean, when I drive through a settlement and there's swimming pools,
*  like right here, and already these people can't really access water.
*  That's all very, like that brings up things that are very, very familiar.
*  When I would talk to people about things like that moment, right?
*  We are trying to get hooked up to the water and we can't.
*  Or I was talking to a sort of city administrator in one of the larger Palestinian cities.
*  And he, I mean, this was the kind of person, right?
*  He had lived in America for a long time.
*  He had a civil engineering degree.
*  I think he had been educated in the North Carolina university system.
*  Right?
*  Right?
*  When people talk about Palestinian leadership, right?
*  That is just like trying to make things better there.
*  Like this guy was just like, he was trying to get a garbage dump sited.
*  They needed a place to put trash.
*  And you would just hear these genuinely Kafka-esque stories of interfacing
*  with Israeli bureaucratic process.
*  And there would be versions of it that were really sinister, right?
*  If you wanted to report violence from Israeli settlers,
*  you would have to go to an Israeli settlement and go report that in a police station
*  where the police were Israeli settlers.
*  And then maybe go up the line in the legal system of more and more Israeli settlers.
*  Right?
*  I mean, that's who's running the judges.
*  And you would end up spending months, years of your life at this.
*  There could be reprisal only to eventually, usually your claim would be denied.
*  But this also happened in all kinds of ways that were more just,
*  we want to get the garbage dump sited, right?
*  We want to get hooked up to the water.
*  We want a permit to expand our houses in area C.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a huge one.
*  And you'd end up in these endless appeal processes, which, you know,
*  you're in a process.
*  It's legitimate, right?
*  Somebody's listening to you.
*  This costs money too, by the way.
*  This costs a lot of money.
*  This costs money, actually.
*  All of this costs money.
*  So I'm curious because you've done a lot of studying this.
*  It made me think a lot about things I'd read of the American South, right?
*  The sort of, I'm curious what you thought about this domination by bureaucracy.
*  Obviously the thing that I would immediately allude to,
*  and I'm just case for reparations, which on its face is based on a system that does not look
*  racist, right?
*  GI Bill, home loans, this instinct during the New Deal to build this gigantic middle class,
*  which does not look, in fact, none of the laws on their face say anything about race at all.
*  But through bureaucracy, by delegating power to certain people who you, in fact, know are racist,
*  you can affect the same thing.
*  Here it was obviously, you know, like it was much more labyrinthine and complicated.
*  But the impulse is the same, which is to say, how do I activate the appearance of process,
*  law, in some cases, democracy, and still achieve the same result?
*  Yeah, I just had this feeling when I would listen to people talk.
*  And maybe this was me pulling it all together at that point was, this all feels like you take
*  the bureaucracy, take the violence, you take the water, you take, for instance, building a fence
*  in such a way so that you can no longer access your olive grove.
*  It just sounds like somebody saying to you, we kind of really don't want you here.
*  It would really be better if you just kind of left and making it as difficult as possible,
*  sometimes in ways that are horrific, sometimes in ways that are Byzantine and, you know,
*  a little bit more subtle.
*  We just would really, really like you to leave.
*  I saw this in East Jerusalem, you know what I mean?
*  People who had been there for generations.
*  You know, maybe, you know, you have a grandchild and you want to have another bedroom for that child.
*  Well, I can't get the permit.
*  There's a permit process that I have to go through.
*  My permit is denied.
*  You know, and meanwhile, you know, there are settlers in East Jerusalem who have no problem
*  expanding at all.
*  Like you're seeing it right in front of you.
*  Let me texture that out just a little bit, because I think there's something
*  worth saying about that, which is so there are different kinds of IDs you can have as a Palestinian.
*  But one thing you'll hear from Israeli Jews is that this is a thing that makes Israel
*  different, right?
*  Than some of the places it's compared to like apartheid South Africa,
*  that there are Palestinian Israelis that they can vote.
*  They have protection under many Israeli laws.
*  So I'm curious how the kind of situation and the laws around Palestinian Israelis read to you.
*  They're still second class citizens.
*  They are not the equivalent of Jewish Israelis.
*  And you can see that very, very specifically in the law.
*  I mean, this is one of the things we were just talking about.
*  If you're a Jewish Israeli and you fall in love with somebody else, no matter where they're from,
*  it's pretty easy for them to become a citizen and live with you in Tel Aviv.
*  God forbid you be a Palestinian Israeli in Tel Aviv and fall in love with somebody that lives in the West Bank.
*  And then you say, why is that?
*  And this to me is actually like the really, really core problem.
*  How do you define a Jewish state?
*  And if you define it as an overwhelming majority, say 80-20, which is what I've seen,
*  you end up activating controls to make that so.
*  And so you actually really, it's actually quite dangerous to have Palestinian Israelis
*  on the same level of citizenship as Jewish Israelis.
*  If you define a Jewish state by demography, you actually have to, the laws have to do certain things.
*  To maintain that. And so it's like there's a motive, an incentive, I mean, maybe even a mandate
*  to have second tier citizenship.
*  That to me, I just, is indefensible and it's especially indefensible
*  with a country that has a quote unquote special relationship, as we always say,
*  with the United States of America, where some of the most violent and most significant battles
*  have been fought, or people either having no citizenship at all, or a second tier citizenship.
*  Second class citizenship.
*  When I would speak to Palestinians who are caught in that particular web, for instance,
*  Iran is Jerusalem because it's crowded and because there is a resistance to letting Palestinians build,
*  they have made it possible to build these weird, very lightly regulated, very close together,
*  huge apartment buildings for Palestinians, like right outside the green line.
*  But you can keep your citizenship, so they're pushing them further out.
*  And the belief among many Palestinians is that one day they're just going to revoke that citizenship.
*  And sort of at every level of Palestinian life, I would talk to people.
*  The feeling was something that you reflected a couple minutes ago.
*  I'd say, well, what do you think all this policy is about? What do you think they want?
*  And say, they want me to leave, right? What they're trying to do is get me, if I live in
*  East Jerusalem, to move outside the wall. If I live outside the wall, because of the way that is
*  unpoliced and sort of ungoverned, move further out such that I don't have that citizenship anymore.
*  And if I live further out, what they really want is for me to go to Jordan, right?
*  And universally among every Palestinian I spoke to, and this seemed consonant with policy to me,
*  that's what the Israelis, Jews truly wanted, right? That was the sort of point of policy
*  to the extent practicable.
*  That certainly seemed correct to me. I mean, that's what I seem to observe.
*  And one of the great sticky, difficult things to process was, in the case of Jim Crow, right,
*  you really have a group of people who are just trying to dominate. That's it. They don't have
*  any sort of, there's no past trauma. All human beings have some trauma. This certainly is no
*  collective trauma like you would find among Jewish Israelis, right?
*  And so, on some level, I would feel this kind of sympathy, like this understanding for this idea
*  that only among our own, only in a state that we absolutely control can we ultimately feel safe.
*  And yet, I would see this thing come out of it that was also familiar at the same time.
*  I'm still kind of grappling with that. I'm still really, really, really kind of grappling with
*  that because I have the feeling for understanding. In fact, I shouldn't even say I have the feeling.
*  I've grown up around that. I've known people who felt like that. Like that's a thing that
*  latently exists in a lot of African American minds. It's never been possible. We're very American.
*  So, there isn't a huge movement around state building. But the dream of a Wakanda, for instance,
*  that one day we're going to go somewhere and we're not going to have to deal with any of this.
*  But to see that dream effectively meant there was one tier of citizenship for half the population,
*  and the other half were always something less. How can we ever fulfill this part about being
*  democratic, about being fair, when the mandate is you have to have an overwhelming majority
*  of a certain group of people? That just feels like it automatically seeds the ground.
*  One of the struggles I had with your book is I went to many of the same places you went,
*  and almost everywhere you went, I had almost the exact same reaction. There are very few
*  words in the travel log here that I would disagree with. It's the places you didn't go,
*  and the people you didn't want to bring in, who also echo in my head. To bring some of them in,
*  I think one of the things you didn't reckon with here, you reckon a lot with Israeli Jewish
*  violence towards Palestinians, and not with Palestinian violence towards Israelis or Jews,
*  going all the way back. You're attentive to massacres that happened around the formation
*  of the State of Israel when they went from Jews to Palestinians, but the other way around goes
*  unmentioned. But I think when you're asking that question, you can't understand how Israel got to
*  the answer it got to without reckoning with that, because there are people who came to a different
*  answer. They wanted separation. They believed in a two-state solution. They fought for it. Some of
*  them died for it, yet Sakra Bin was assassinated. And what destroyed their political movement
*  was suicide bombings. One of the things that I do not find Israeli Jews unclear about
*  is that they are oppressors right now. I do not find that they hide from that fact.
*  Now, many of them say, well, what would you have me do? I was part of the peace movement.
*  I was out there in the streets in 98, 99, 2000, 2001, 2002. I don't always have a good answer,
*  but that is their self-conception, right? That they understood this had become something that was
*  lurching in a monstrous direction. They had built political power to try to change it.
*  And what they feel lost them that chance was not just failures on their own side, although I think
*  many of them will admit to many of their own political failures, but agency on the other side.
*  Deals met with violence, with blowing up buses and children dying. I mean, you know some of the
*  story. I know you've read a bunch of these books. How do you think about that?
*  I can't accept it.
*  Which part can't you accept?
*  I can't accept that your interest in a true democracy was destroyed by violence
*  from your partner. I just can't accept that. First of all, I think even in this rendering
*  that we have here, I suspected there are reasons for why that suicide bombing even happened. I
*  suspect there's a context for that, but let's put that aside for a moment.
*  1830, I think is the year Nat Turner is enslaved, and he decides that he's going to lead a rebellion.
*  And of course, in that rebellion, he kills and the people that follow him, men, women,
*  children in their crib, just like axe handles, slaughter babies in their crib, right? Horrific,
*  horrific violence. I've thought about that a lot because in a lot of circles Nat Turner's a kind
*  of hero, you know, and we can never know who he would be. But I have to believe they were enslaved
*  people who saw that and said, I just, I can't be a part of this. I can't do this. Nat Turner's
*  violence though, whatever it was, and just did not make slavery therefore justifiable. It did not
*  destroy, and there was a blowback by the way. Like there were people who would sit here and
*  will argue to you with some evidence that in fact Virginia was on the road to emancipation.
*  And this was the thing that blew it up. After Nat Turner, you see this complete backlash.
*  But enslavement is unjust. Apartheid is unjust, and what I saw over there, and not even what I
*  saw, but what I read coming back afterwards, the reports I read, which I'm sure you've read from
*  Amnesty International, from you were with Betsalem, from Betsalem, from Human Rights Watch,
*  hearing Benny Morris, you know, who's probably not mine, you know, say yes, in fact, on the West Bank,
*  it really, really is apartheid. Reading about, we're going to talk about this later with books,
*  but reading about the history of Israel's cooperation with South Africa and the back
*  and forth, which goes way, way, way back. I just, I can't accept that the violence
*  committed by the people who have less power somehow relieves you of the burden
*  of forming a just society. I have had a long and really contentious relationship with the
*  idea of nonviolence among African Americans, okay? We have endured so much violence from this country,
*  just so much. I mean, kids shot down, you know, the Civil Rights Movement is just a catalog of
*  violent acts committed against black people. We never had the luxury of saying that the violence
*  of white racism and the violence of white supremacy somehow destroyed our movement.
*  It's just not an option. And so I question your commitment to justice, to democracy,
*  if it can't endure this. And lastly, as the last thing I'll say is probably one of the most
*  affecting conversations I had after October 7th, with some of the folks in breaking the silence,
*  who lost people on October 7th and have to somehow figure out a way that they didn't say,
*  I'm done with this. You know, my principles are out the door. They have to find some sort of way,
*  even amidst that violence, to adhere to their ideals and their beliefs.
*  I think I agree with half of this. And the half I agree with is that if your commitment to democracy,
*  to human rights, cannot withstand these kinds of moments, this kind of violence, then yeah,
*  you were not committed to democracy. You're not committed to human rights. I don't think Israel's
*  committed to democracy. I found nothing more strange than being there and having person after
*  person tell me that Israel was on the horizon of losing its status as a liberal democracy.
*  And I would say to them every time Israel is not a liberal democracy. It is a sovereign over
*  millions of people who cannot vote. It is not a liberal democracy. And in my view, it probably
*  never will be. Right? Wait, wait, wait, hold on. And what was the answer you got? I would not say
*  I got good answers. But I do think here you're moving a little bit between the question of
*  the morality of a position, the commitment of a position and the politics of a position.
*  You say early in the book that all you're writing is politics. Right? And I think of that as true
*  for mine. So I do think there's a sort of difficulty. Right? Go back to the Nat Turner moment.
*  Right? As you say, that probably did, or at least plausibly did, push Virginia off of the path it
*  otherwise on. And Nat Turner was not the leadership of what would be the sovereign government
*  in the bordering state. I mean, your book does not engage with Hamas. It does engage with Palestinian
*  authority. One thing that I think was a bit absent is agency among Palestinians too and
*  Palestinian political players, or even, forget agency, right? Aspiration. Because if you want to
*  say that where Israel is now is in a moral state, I think you're right. I don't have a problem saying
*  that. But in terms of what will change any of that, or what will change the actual lived situation
*  in the West Bank or live situation in Gaza, it has to be a political settlement that runs somehow
*  through a deal with Israel. Right? What people call the vaunted complexity of the conflict,
*  right? Which you're, I think, correctly often frustrated by is if this is impossible to understand
*  when it's not, I don't think it's the history. It's the irreconcilability of
*  interests and needs and stories. I never felt when I was there or when I read about it,
*  that what I'm reading is complex in the sense that it is hard to understand.
*  It is complex in that it is hard to see how you get out of it with people being
*  who they are. I'll say this other piece, which maybe makes this a little bit more concrete.
*  The Israeli founding father, so to speak, you spend the most time on, is Jabotinsky. People
*  don't know Jabotinsky. He's sort of the leader of the revisionist Zionists. Very, very violent guy.
*  And among sort of early Israelis, he is one who, I think, says clearly, there will just be war here,
*  and we will have to crush the people who live here in order to live here. Now, he's in that
*  period of Israel, a controversial figure. He's not initially allowed to be buried in Israel.
*  But I think it's fair to say we live in Jabotinsky's Israel. Netanyahu's father was
*  his secretary. But he leads to Menachem Begin is his protege. That leads to Likud. Likud is
*  Netanyahu's party. But what destroys all the people who made him a marginal figure, I mean,
*  what destroys labor as a functional force in Israel, is that violence. So, I mean, you can say,
*  I think, that that's immoral of Israelis to allow the violence to kind of knock them off course in
*  the way it did. But nevertheless, it did. And so, I mean, I think that's where my mind hitches. You
*  have to account for it somehow. If you're trying to think about, well, what does anybody do here?
*  Leroy L. Johnson You know, I've been sitting here thinking about the question you asked,
*  because it doesn't sit with me. It's not your question that doesn't sit well with me. It's
*  actually my answer. And when you asked, well, why didn't I talk to you? You know, why didn't I see,
*  you know, some of the, I guess, what would be what we call like more than a hard right wing.
*  Aaron Powell I wouldn't even say the hard right.
*  Leroy L. Johnson Somebody that thinks this is a good idea, maybe.
*  Aaron Powell Not even, there are people who think it's a good idea.
*  Leroy L. Johnson Right.
*  Aaron Powell And there are people who don't have a, I would say the center of Israeli society now,
*  Leroy L. Johnson Yes.
*  Aaron Powell has just given up.
*  Leroy L. Johnson Right.
*  Aaron Powell It's resignation.
*  Leroy L. Johnson Right.
*  Aaron Powell Mixed post October 7th with fury.
*  Leroy L. Johnson Right.
*  Aaron Powell And then there's a right wing, which I think in the resignation,
*  in the inability of the center to come up with a different politics, the right wing took control.
*  Leroy L. Johnson Right.
*  Aaron Powell And their project is expansionistic and I think expulsion ultimately.
*  Leroy L. Johnson Right.
*  Aaron Powell That's my view of Israel.
*  Leroy L. Johnson That's what you would say is I have not engaged that portion of the society,
*  right? Aaron Powell Yes.
*  Leroy L. Johnson Okay.
*  Leroy L. Johnson All right. I think that's actually fair. I felt lied to. I felt lied to by my craft.
*  I felt lied to by major media organizations and by media organization, I mean like producers of books,
*  films, etc. Like the whole, the whole corpse of storytelling, which is what this book is obsessed
*  with. I wanted to know how that happened. I wanted to know why there was so much difference between
*  what you saw and what I saw and what I felt like I understood back here in America and what most
*  people I knew understood back here in America. That immediately forced me to privilege and this
*  was just a decision I made. Okay, who am I not hearing from? Who have I not heard from?
*  And so that necessarily means marginalizing a portion of it. But what I felt was largely like
*  the narratives that I've heard out of it have been discredited for me. It doesn't mean there's
*  nothing true or you know what I mean, anything to be learned in it. But in terms of my question,
*  how did I get this so wrong? I probably was not compelled to have a conversation with the people
*  who I feel even now, it was in their interest for me to get it wrong.
*  Aaron Powell But how about on the Palestinian side, right?
*  I said earlier, there's no member of the PA in this book, right? No member of Hamas.
*  I've heard you say elsewhere that that's because Hamas is in Gaza, but there's a lot of Hamas in
*  the West Bank. They control villages, right? They're there. They're suppressed by PA and
*  Israeli security cooperation. One thing that I think we all tend to miss in this is the role of
*  religion on both sides. I think that when you're covering this as an American, and I've said this
*  on the show before, I worry that we have just enough access to really get this wrong. Because,
*  I mean, tons of Israelis speak English, enough Palestinians do, but the ones who do on both sides
*  tend to be much more secular, much more educated. I think compared to most outlets, I've had a fairly
*  wide range of opinion on Israel on the show. And I've had everyone from right-wing Israeli
*  commentators to actual Hamas apologists. And still, I believe that maybe with one exception
*  of people I've had on, that if you got all the people I've had on in a room, they would solve it.
*  And that's because it's not really representative.
*  As well, why is one group right-wing advocates, or what you just said, and the other group Hamas
*  apologists? What do you mean? Like, why are they not right-wing apologists?
*  They're right-wing apologists.
*  Yeah, that's just not what you just said. You called the Hamas folks, and I'm not saying they're
*  not apologists.
*  I have a...
*  I compared to... When I say I've had right-wing Israelis on, I mean people who support Netanyahu,
*  not people who support Ben Gavir and Smotrich. I do not put... I mean, Hamas is a complicated
*  organization. I've tried to treat it on the show as a complicated organization.
*  It did spend many, many years specifically targeting killing civilians. I take that as
*  different.
*  You take that different than Netanyahu?
*  I take that as different than Netanyahu, yeah.
*  Certainly the military wing there. Do you not? Like, what did you think of October 7th?
*  I thought it was horrific. I thought it was absolutely horrific.
*  I mean, one of the things I just said in an earlier question was I've spent a long time
*  grappling with the idea of nonviolence. And the other part of that is the place of violence in
*  the struggles that I sympathize with, that I associate with. And I've pretty much come out of
*  it feeling like the violence is corrupting. And it's corrupting amongst even the folks who declare
*  their aims that the first thing that you end up doing is folks end up killing each other.
*  There just is no part of my politics at this point in my life that allows me to see
*  a thousand people massacred and say, I don't know whatever the excuses are.
*  I don't have that. And I'm not saying that. I just really want to drill down on this.
*  I feel like if you lose sight of the value of individual human life, you have lost something.
*  And I might be a little naive, right? Because people have to rule states and they have to
*  go to war and they have to do, you know, people make these calculations besides Hamas.
*  But as a writer, as a thinker, I think you've lost something. I think that's just, that's my
*  belief. And I'm not Palestinian. I'm not here speaking for Palestinians. I'm here speaking for
*  Ta-Nehisi Coates and his politics. Those are my politics. So I was horrified.
*  One of the reasons I ask about this out of the politics is to me,
*  one of the ways I understand what is both true and to me impossible there,
*  is I understand the right of both societies in symbiotic relationship to each other.
*  I think it's Smotrich, the finance minister who said once that the Palestinian authority
*  is a liability and Hamas is an asset. And Hamas has, I think, repeatedly done things
*  to make the Israeli right more powerful. Right? I mean, I just can't accept that.
*  Tell me why. I don't know, man. When you start like
*  dropping bombs, when you wipe out 2% of the population of people that are caged in,
*  I don't care what their leadership did. I mean, this actually goes back to the October 7th question,
*  because you have lost sight of completely of individual life. And I guess, I actually don't
*  know how you're different. I was actually sitting here thinking about it, because I want to take
*  what you're saying seriously. And maybe a week from now, I will have some other answer. But as
*  I'm sitting here right now, I don't care if you have the bureaucracy of government,
*  I don't know, the appearance of democracy, army, whatever. First of all, people like
*  Bingavere are in your cabinet. You can't act like they sit over here and you're not with them.
*  And you can countenance wiping out that many people with such impunity.
*  I also have a lot of trouble here, because I think Hamas knew what it was about to do to its own people.
*  I won't accept that.
*  You don't think they did?
*  I mean, if you're formulation, they knew what was about to happen as a result of them doing this.
*  Yes, but I don't want to accept that the people who are dropping the bombs had to drop the bombs.
*  And when I hear the formulation, what they were about to do to their own people,
*  I just feel like it removes somebody and the power of somebody to do something different.
*  I don't disagree with that.
*  And so I guess I'm disagreeing with the formulation of it. That's what I'm saying.
*  Without getting caught on the formulation, because I was one of a lot of people who
*  my first essay after October 7th was, do not give into this.
*  Don't do exactly what you're about to do, which then Israel did.
*  I guess my question for you, rather than us getting caught up on
*  what exact circle of moral illegitimacy different factions are here, where does it leave you?
*  One of the things that I was asking people there is from the American perspective,
*  a lot of the Palestinians I know want single-state solutions.
*  I found no one there at any level of power who wanted that.
*  No one who wasn't the kind of person I might meet at a conference seemed to be interested.
*  That's something I would hear here, hear here, and not there.
*  And this is what I mean about the politics.
*  Like it's the sort of the interests are often different than what I thought they were going
*  to be. And then when you got to the more religious people, fairly few of them who I knew and talked
*  to, and that's a huge gap in the way I present this, it gets much more messianic, right?
*  People believe in outcomes that are non-political, right? That's true among the Israeli messianic,
*  right? True among the Palestinian messianic figures. My point of this is not
*  criticism. As I said, in the places you went, I have the same view.
*  It's like forcing these other things into the conversation and trying to think about how you
*  think about them. So I want to go back to just this idea of purpose. And I
*  I just want to submit, while leaving you free to have your interpretation that you have as a reader,
*  because I really do believe in that. You have to understand it. What I was really, really occupied
*  with was why I am in America and I am seeing this so differently than what both you and I saw.
*  Let me ask you like this. Do you feel like what you saw in the West Bank, particularly,
*  do you feel like that is well rendered? Do you feel like Americans have an understanding of what's
*  happening there? I want to speak for Americans because the understanding sort of... I'm asking
*  that because I feel like maybe you had because you were informed, you read, and you knew. But
*  can you get out of that a little bit? In other words, can you imagine yourself
*  outside of the kind of expertise you had, the fact that you had been there before?
*  Can you imagine maybe how other people perceived it?
*  You know, I've talked about part of this. When I came to Washington,
*  the heyday of the Marty Peretz New Republic, I felt that the conversation about Israel
*  and the things we are talking about in Israel was one of the most censored conversations in
*  American politics, right? There's a famed book by Mir Shemar and Waltz called The Israel Lobby.
*  You would have these huge fights over whether or not you could even really talk about that book.
*  And back then, I think that the reality of it was suppressed. And you can go read
*  a editorial by Peretz calling me a Jewish charlatan, right? In a recent burst of press
*  about me, people brought back up this idea of the juice box mafia, me and Matt Iglesias. That was
*  Eli Lake and Jamie Kerchak's name for me, Matt, and Spencer Ackerman, in part because we were
*  insufficiently pro-Israel, right? And I think that broke.
*  About when?
*  My view is it broke during the Obama administration or began to. And one reason I think you see what
*  you saw there, right, and see it as clearly as you did is I also think Israel just became different
*  over time. I think the reason this looks different to you, and I think the way it looks to you is,
*  at least in terms of the West Bank, correct, right? I argue with none of that,
*  is that there isn't really a possible other interpretation of the current reality.
*  One of the things I tell Israelis, Jews, when I speak to them about this is that I can have some
*  sympathy for how you maybe ended up here, but there is no sympathy for where here is. And
*  allowing this now to be not just reality, but a reality that is,
*  there's no, nobody's even trying to change anymore, is once people take it as it is,
*  and I think to me the political importance of your book is you're somebody who walked in,
*  opened your eyes, and this is what you see. I think one reason that it looks simpler to you now
*  than it does to a lot of people who have been doing this for decades isn't because they were
*  all lying. It's because it wasn't as simple two decades ago. It wasn't as straightforward. There
*  are people trying to do something different and it seemed like they might succeed. And it is the
*  closing of the horizon of hope that has actually changed us, which I mostly blame Benjamin Netanyahu
*  for. Not only Israeli society deserves a fair amount of credit there too, and so do some on
*  the Palestinian side, but I think it's different now. I just think the claim that it was democracy
*  was always, like, I think that was always a lie. I agree. I think that was, and that was like,
*  in my mind, and I remember trying to figure this out, like, can the Palestinians, well, okay,
*  but like, only democracy in the Middle East was a thing that was repeatedly said over and over
*  and over again, to the point that, you know what I say, it was like Nike, just do it. You know what
*  I mean? It was that, and that has power. For people who do not know and don't have the kind
*  of details and haven't seen what you've seen, these sorts of words, this sort of branding,
*  it sticks in the back of the head. What year would you say America became a democracy,
*  if in your view it ever did? In my view? Yeah. 65? Right. Something like that. And imperfect
*  then too, right? It's not like in 67, this is all working out great, right? Yes, yes, yes.
*  You know much better than me. Yes. I think that's the way to understand how the writers
*  you're talking about understood the path Israel was on. I agree with you. I agree with you, and
*  that itself is another lie that I feel like it causes great problems actually. It causes huge,
*  huge problems because Americans understand themselves as this ancient democracy.
*  And then that affects how they see the rest of the world, that affects how they interact with the
*  rest of the world, that erases whole populations as though their narrative doesn't matter. Because
*  black people say, well, what about like, you know, my mother or my grandmother? Like she just like,
*  I know the person that just got the right to vote, you know? And so suddenly they're not part of the
*  I agree it's the same way, but it's just as problematic. That's what I was saying. And I
*  didn't know that. I didn't know that at all. I don't know how you're taking some of what I'm
*  saying, but I think it's possible that you think what I'm saying is that if you had talked to more
*  Israeli Jews, you would have more sympathy for where they are. I am not saying that. You might
*  have a lot less, but I think they're part of appreciating where this is now. You know,
*  um, how many major media organizations like have a Palestinian bureau chief in Jerusalem?
*  How often do I like cut on the TV and I look at who's covering,
*  you know, whatever conflict is going over there at the moment. And do I see a Palestinian?
*  And I just have this feeling that there is a part of like, this is not
*  equal in terms of who's getting to tell their story. And so I guess the question I, you know,
*  I have for you ultimately is, and I'm working my way to it is
*  with my quest to understand why I had one understanding. And if you can just go with me
*  here, why I believe a lot of Americans have one understanding and it differs from what I saw over
*  there, like trying to understand why do you think that quest would have been improved by talking to
*  the people you would have liked me to talk to? Do you think I would have came to a better
*  understanding about that? I'd say two things. I don't know about your personal quest, right?
*  I think that there's subtlety. But as you said, no, I thought you really wanted to leave space
*  for the reader to have their own relationship with the book here, man. I do. You're right. Go ahead.
*  Good. I'm going to shut up. I'm going to shut up. Good. I do think so, but this is in a very
*  different way. My critique, not of anybody's book, but of Joe Biden and the Biden administration.
*  One thing I've said to a lot of people who are mad at college protesters over the past year
*  is that the college protesters in many ways understand modern Israel better than the
*  70 year old American or 80 year old American politicians because the only Israel they ever
*  knew is Netanyahu's Israel. Whereas I think there are a lot of people in American politics
*  still trying to negotiate with the Israel of 18 years ago. I'm not here telling you
*  for your own journey who to talk to and not talk to. Or frankly telling you at all,
*  for the work I do, I have to think about all these other players in it and figures,
*  but also for what I believe your book is going to be doing in the world no matter what.
*  So you think despite my intention, there's going to be a thing that's going to happen.
*  Your book is an artifact. You don't control it anymore. You know that much better than me.
*  And your book is going to be this year, the biggest selling version of the Palestinian
*  narrative. And there's a certain number of the people who need to be convinced by it,
*  who the absence of grappling with what Hamas is will make it easier for them to dismiss it.
*  You know, I would say two things. You just said something and I'm not going to dispute the truth
*  of it. How can it be that my book is going to be the biggest best selling whatever of the
*  Palestinian narrative? That to me is the essence of the tragedy right there.
*  Well, that's fair. But also, man, your book is probably going to be the biggest selling
*  thing on this on either side this year. It's worth accepting who you are.
*  I do. I do. I do. But nevertheless, man, this is something I grapple with. It is like the...
*  I felt responsible over it. I felt responsible. You know what I mean?
*  You say that you feel that the American conversation has lied to you. And I think my fear and the thing
*  that I've come to over the past year is to me worse, which is it... I wouldn't use the word lying
*  exactly, but the illusions, we believe the illusions, right? It would be easier. It's always
*  easier if it's actually cynical, right? Because then you can rip the cynicism back. And at some
*  point somebody's got like the true outlook on the situation and is just executing a strategy. I don't
*  think that's what's going on. And we have illusions about the Israelis. I think we have illusions about
*  the Palestinians. We have illusions about ourselves too. When I just did this episode with David
*  Remnick, and one of the things I said, which I've said before is I always try to just move
*  this conversation over two state solutions and one state solutions off. And that's how much people
*  say, oh no, that's a dodge. That's a luxury. And I don't mean it that way, or I don't agree with that
*  interpretation of it. I don't think a solution right now is possible. And I think debating them
*  allows us to put ourselves in this sort of slightly heroic role that makes it so by imagining some
*  future radically, radically different situation. We don't have to apprehend the one we're in right
*  now. And I think people, and this is my favorite part of your book, I think people have to spend
*  some time, particularly in American and the American policy conversation, not grappling with
*  where they want this to go, but where it actually is. And I think a lot of mistakes come from working
*  backwards rather than working forwards. And now it's my time to push you. I actually think
*  political imagination is really, really important. And maybe that is because I am coming from a
*  tradition where for most of our history, there really was no recognized political leadership.
*  And by recognized, I mean the ability to be a congressman or governor or some sort of like,
*  I mean, Jesus, if you think about it, like it was pastors, right? All of that's imagination.
*  And you're pulling out a Bible to say what, what X, Y, and Z, what the world should be, what,
*  that's your interpretive text. And so, I don't know, I understand what you're saying. And I
*  guess what I feel like, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, what I'm hearing from you is there is a
*  kind of allot of touch liberal fantasizing. Yes. That you really want to avoid and be skeptical of.
*  I don't, the first step, when you talk about the black preachers and that horizon of imagination,
*  no one was more in touch with the reality than they were. Right. So I will listen to these
*  arguments from people who I feel there are deeply rooted in the reality. There's a line in this book,
*  The Necessity of Exile by Shul McGee, and I think it's a quotation of just someone who's not named,
*  but he talks about the two-state solution as existing now to make liberal American
*  Jews feel better about themselves. I'm not trying to go all the way there.
*  I believe nothing as much as I believe things change. The horizon today is not going to be
*  the horizon in five years or 10 years. The politics today will not be the politics in 10 years or 15
*  years or 20 years. Everybody, like they always underestimate how much things change in a decade,
*  politically. So my point is not that no solution, no, nothing different is ever possible.
*  It's simply that I have an allergy to it as a kind of a dodge, as a way of not dealing with
*  where we are. Like what is the next step? Not the last step, the next step. And I find that people
*  sometimes debate the last step instead. Right. I can understand that. I can understand that.
*  It feels to me like you are trying to answer the question of how do we get out of this?
*  Like what is an actual workable way and maybe even moral, if I may impose upon you,
*  workable and moral way out. Is that correct? Yeah. Or just how do we see it without illusion
*  right now? You described something in the book that I felt too. There's a hyper vividness to
*  being there. I've done a lot of reporting trips my life, been to a lot of places.
*  This one has some quality to it. I mean, the fact that it's biblical land felt real to me there.
*  Yeah. You know, you drive up and down, you know, you go up to the northern border,
*  which is now in a totally different situation. But I was there was on fire and now there's more
*  act of war happening even than there was then. You drive like down the coast, right there,
*  you know, you go to the, I was at the tomb of the patriarchs. I was at the Western mall.
*  There is something there. It's almost hallucinatory and it's vividness. Yeah. I don't
*  really know how to explain it or understand it, but it, you understand why it captures people.
*  I totally got it. Look, man, I was there day five. I was like, when can I leave?
*  When can I leave? And then I left on day 10. And two days after I got back here, I was like,
*  when am I going back? You know, it was fatiguing, horrific, harrowing, some of the best food I've
*  ever had in my life. And I don't say that to be trivial. I say that to, again, recognize this
*  idea that there were actually people there living there, creating a culture, doing the things that
*  human beings do. Some of the most hospitable people, as we talked about that I've ever met
*  in my life. Some of the most open signs of violence, like things I was seeing, I couldn't
*  have just saw that. That is not some sort of computerized AI machine gun that fires non-lethal
*  rounds. I didn't just see that. Things I had to take pictures to remember. No, Ta-Nehisi. You
*  really did see that. I think part of it for me is that I work, even here, and I had to confront
*  this, I work with like, okay, here is how history is doing its work right now. Even though these
*  people are long gone, here is how they're doing their work right now. Here is how history continues
*  to haunt. And there it was just there. There are parts of the trip I haven't talked about at all
*  that have actually made it easier for me to understand things going on here. So one of the
*  things I did when I was there was I spent some time with Yoram Hazony, who political obsessives
*  here will know as an Israeli philosopher who wrote a book called The Virtue of Nationalism.
*  The Virtue of Nationalism. That's interesting.
*  And it became a huge book on the Trumpian right. He then founded something called the National
*  Conservatism Conferences. Fourth year was this year. JD Vance spoke. JD Vance is sort of a natcon.
*  Very, very influential movement here. And I understood that movement a lot better when I
*  was there. Because when you are there, or at least in Israel, nationalism is the most physical I have
*  ever felt it to be. Right? And I mean, we're talking here in a country at war and post-October
*  7, but still every square inch that can have Israeli flags does. Right? America has nationalism,
*  but this movement that has been imported here from there and is influential here from there,
*  it has made it much easier for me to understand what JD Vance and Donald Trump are actually
*  talking about. Because when you're there, nationalism is physical and constant and everywhere
*  in a way that comparatively here it's ephemeral and subtle and wispy. Like the existence of the
*  nation as an organism that has an immune system and defenders and right, that the people will
*  die for it any minute in all directions. It's there in a way that here it's abstracted and there it is
*  right in front of you. It is the people holding guns. It is the people who, when I was walking
*  through a Palestinian refugee camp and just talking to some people in a coffee shop and they just
*  pull up their shirt to show me the heeled over bullet holes, right? From being at a protest and
*  being shot. It takes things that are abstract here and makes them literal. Can I take you back to
*  something I've kind of been thinking about that you raised early in this concert? Can we go back
*  to this idea of Palestinian agency and systems just for a moment? How do you feel about the
*  conversation around the analogy toward apartheid, which is one that I believe in? Do you find that
*  appropriate? I do find it appropriate. The analogy I've used since coming back because it's the one
*  I know is the American South. I sometimes feel things like apartheid like shut some people's
*  minds down. You get into this like technical well in South Africa and I don't know enough to have
*  that argument with people. But I have read enough, including you, on the American South and the Jim
*  Crow era that the first day I was in the West Bank, I said the first thing almost that I thought was
*  this is what it must have felt like. Got it. So how do you like, and this is like the difficult
*  thing for me, like how does Palestinian agency or agency of any group of people I would say
*  in a system like that work? I'm going to give a very crude version of this, so please don't think
*  I'm ascribing this to you. I guess what I want to ask is how do you avoid the danger of saying
*  the awful politics of your leadership has put you in this position where we have imposed apartheid
*  on you or some version of that? When you talk about agency, it's like a lot of things in this
*  where I think in like the year 2000, year 2005, 2008, there was a bunch of space open and since then
*  it has been the policy of Israel to foreclose Palestinian political agency, right, to arrest
*  people who could become leaders, to keep the West Bank and Gaza divided. So I mean, this is one of
*  these places where I have this frustration again, where you talk to Israelis and they tell you about
*  things from 20 years ago and some of those arguments are reasonable and then you're here
*  and where here is, is a place where there's been a long running explicit political project
*  to make sure Palestinians cannot develop political power. And so this question of agency to me has
*  changed over time. And it's the thing I said to you earlier that I spend a lot of time trying
*  to understand how Israel got to where it is now. And I do that without, for me, that changing the
*  fact that where it is now is immoral. And also for me, without I think having illusions that it has
*  an obvious way back, that's a place where I found that I had the single largest gulf between people
*  I otherwise agree with and feel very politically aligned with there, right? That they kept telling
*  me something was provisional that clearly was not provisional. And this is why I emphasize like the
*  politics of both violence and religion. The thing that I don't know, I can't even imagine how to
*  solve for is that kind of violent veto. Because I don't know a polity like anywhere that is going
*  to keep making deals if people keep dying in large enough numbers. I don't have any answers, man.
*  And I don't pretend to. I'm trying to see it as it is.
*  Yeah. Like I feel, and let's just go with your metaphor of Jim Crow. Like I feel
*  Jim Crow is, I mean, as you are, is wrong. And so your answer to this would be, no,
*  you're not going to see anything that will make you feel like it's not wrong. You're not going to
*  make you say it's justified. But you might see something that says this is how you got here.
*  Is that, am I interpreting that correct? This is part of the story of how you got here.
*  And part of the question of how do you get out.
*  And part of the question of how do you get out.
*  Let me say another thing from the West Bank, right? Which is where we both spent a lot
*  of time. So the canonical theory of the two-state solution is right. Israel pulls back. It pulls
*  back behind the green line. The West Bank is governed by Palestinian leadership of some kind
*  or another. And for a very long time, and I still think this is true, actually, in the American
*  conversation, the Israeli settlers were sort of spoken of as like a radical extremist aberrant
*  class. Yes. Yes. You go there. You go there now. I don't want to get the number wrong off the top
*  of my head. I think it's in the range of five to 600,000 in the West Bank now. I think there's
*  700,000 total, but there's some complexity in all this. A lot of these settlements are just at this
*  point, excerpts, right? Or suburbs. These garrison states are huge cities. And when I then would go
*  into the garrison state settlements, the way they all spoke about themselves was as centuries,
*  right? If we ever pull back, if we do what we did in Gaza and allow this to be self-governed,
*  an army will be raised. And what happened on 10-7 will be a small preview of what will be coming
*  for us eventually. That doesn't make anything happening in the West Bank, right? It doesn't
*  have any effect on the morality of it whatsoever. But it is the politics of Israel that somebody's
*  going to have to deal with at some point or not. And then we're just here. I'm not here to tell you
*  I've come up with some answer. It's just one of the things that has to sit in the pot. Yeah.
*  Yeah. No, I don't disagree with that at all. I don't disagree with that at all. Again, I just felt
*  like... And I guess my one critique of you, the place where I really, really disagree with one of
*  the places, we probably disagree quite a lot in this conversation, but the one area I think you
*  approach this conversation with a deeper knowledge than a lot of other people do.
*  I tell you, man, I came back and I told people about that trip and they said, what?
*  I was sending pictures when I was there. They were like, what? I think the settlements is a great
*  example. I thought settlements were people who kind of were outside of the Israeli state.
*  I did not realize they were subsidies. I didn't realize they were actually part of the state.
*  I didn't understand that at all. And I guess, and maybe I'm giving myself too much credit here,
*  but I guess I feel like as a curious person, a relatively somewhat intellectual person,
*  that I did not know that. I think that is real. I mean, I grew up in
*  American Jewish Zionist culture. I'm not here to tell you that other people don't take...
*  I believe Joe Biden takes all this as real, as I was saying earlier. So I hope I'm not trying to
*  say that everybody has my views about Israeli democracy, because that's not true. I guess one
*  thing I'd ask you is, you've been really clear that the purpose of the essay was to shift your
*  understanding, right? It's not a policy paper, but you've sort of pushed me both here and other
*  times we've spoken about a sort of absence of political imagination. What's yours, right?
*  What do you imagine here?
*  You're not going to like my answer.
*  But I want to hear it.
*  Okay. I imagine hearing from way more Palestinians. There is, at the end of this piece, a stat from,
*  and I'm sorry I don't have a book in front of me, but by this academic, Maha Nasser,
*  who talks about the numbers. Actually, New Republic is in there. New Republic, Washington Post,
*  the amount of time Palestinians are written about versus when they do, and the numbers are in the
*  single digits. What I am saying is, I think that actually circumscribes our political imagination,
*  but it actually is rooted in my understanding of the black political tradition, right? So
*  you have a group of people that are forbidden by slavery from learning how to read and write,
*  right? And yet seizing that is one of the most important things. The tradition of having black
*  newspapers, the tradition of Frederick Douglass actually becoming a writer,
*  tradition of Ida B. Wells, being able to go back and forth and have a political space.
*  I guess to some extent, certainly it is true in America that people did not want to hear from
*  black people, but nothing like this, I don't think.
*  I think your answer is true, right? I think what you were saying is right.
*  And the tilt in American media is real. But I'm still asking you what you imagine here,
*  right? As you have sit and thought about this and read everything and dreamed about it and written
*  about it. I mean, is it just an event horizon for you? Right? Does it? I just, I feel like I
*  don't have that right. It just feels like I am a... I just, it just doesn't feel right.
*  I try to imagine like somebody trying to talk and figure out like in the 1960s, how are we
*  going to get out of segregation? How are we going to desegregate? So we're not going to hear from
*  any black people. It's absurd. It's one of the reasons why I'm uncomfortable with, I guess,
*  not even just this conversation, but maybe everything I'm doing with the trip, because it's like,
*  dude, I talk to so many people who have a deeper sense and a sharper sense than I do of this.
*  You know what I mean? There are people who have lived this, you know what I mean? And not just
*  lived this, have, you know, can do the scholarship of it. They can talk about it and think about it
*  and have a kind of fluency in it that I just don't. And I just feel like that is a question
*  that I would like to see more Palestinians asked. I think that's a place to end. So always our final
*  question. What are three books you'd recommend to the audience? The first book I would recommend
*  is Justice for Some by Noura Erekat. Justice for Some is supposed to be an analysis, and it is this
*  of the legal work, as she calls it, that undergirds Israel and Israeli rule of Palestinians. But
*  actually, it's kind of a beautiful narrative history, which I just thought was remarkable.
*  Amy Kaplan, man, Our American Israel, the story of an entangled alliance. This gets to something
*  that we talk quite a bit about. This was a pop culture book. It was about how images of Israel
*  have formed in the American mind and why, looking at films, books, television, speeches, etc., there
*  are no politicians, and it's not that. It's about, you know, how have the creative arts interacted
*  in America to create, you know, whatever image and where does that relationship stem through?
*  She actually goes all the way back to the Puritans. It's quite remarkable.
*  And then this one hit me hard, The Unspoken Alliance, Israel's Secret Relationship with
*  South Africa by Sasha Polokhail-Syransky. Boy, that was a tough book. It is an outlining of
*  Israel's relationship with South Africa, which a really singular relationship, the extent to which
*  South Africa actually depended on Israel and vice versa as it happened at the end, and that was,
*  you know, really, really mind-blowing. Tal Haasekotz, thank you very much.
*  Thanks, Azra.
