# Are Democrats Whistling Past the Graveyard?
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2WapQpIw20)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  On November 5th, the New York Times and CNN College released this poll that freaked Democrats
*  out like nothing I've seen in the cycle.
*  The poll showed Trump up in five of the six key battleground states, showed him benefiting
*  from a huge shift in non-white and young voters in his favor, and it set off a complete round
*  of Democratic panic.
*  Biden, it seemed, was just uniquely weak.
*  Then on November 7th, we had this big bunch of elections.
*  And Democrats did really well.
*  In Kentucky, Democrat Andy Beshear held the governor's mansion.
*  In Virginia, Democrats took back the House of Delegates.
*  In Ohio, they got a constitutional amendment protecting abortion.
*  It felt a lot like 2022 when Biden was pulling poorly and everybody predicted a Democratic
*  wipeout.
*  But Democrats did far better in the midterms than anybody expected.
*  Well, they did better, I guess I should say, than almost anybody expected.
*  But Michael Podhorser, he did expect it.
*  Podhorser was a longtime political director of the AFL-CIO.
*  He's kind of a legend in Democratic campaign circles.
*  He founded this thing called the Analyst Institute, which was the nerve center of the data-driven
*  empirical turn in Democratic campaign strategies.
*  Now he writes a sub-stack on these topics called Weekend Reading, which is a descendant
*  of an influential email he used to send out to top campaign strategists.
*  And he never thought 2022 was going to be a wipeout for Democrats.
*  He doesn't think Biden's bad polls are revealing much right now.
*  He thinks the whole way the media thinks about polling is wrong.
*  He calls it mad poll disease, and it drives him a little nuts.
*  He often invents that frustration to me.
*  I'm a nearby member of the media to him.
*  So I invited him on the show to get his take on how Biden looks going into 2024, whether
*  Democrats are making a huge mistake by sidestepping a primary, and what it will take to reconstitute
*  the anti-MAGA coalition we saw in 2020 and 2022.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at nytimes.com.
*  Michael Podhorser, welcome to the show.
*  Hi, Ezra, glad to be here.
*  So I want to begin chronologically.
*  I asked you to come on the show after this big New York Times, Sienna poll showing Trump
*  beating Biden in five of the six key swing states that pull set off a huge panic among
*  Democrats.
*  You think or thought I think it's fair to say that panic was stupid.
*  Why?
*  For several reasons.
*  The most important one is that a poll taken today, especially in 2023, really doesn't
*  tell us anything about November 2024 that we don't already know.
*  The national election is going to be really close.
*  No poll even on the day of the election after millions of people have voted gets that right
*  reliably over and over again, whether it's the midterms or some of the elections that
*  just happened.
*  The media looking at the poll doesn't understand what Americans do, that it's different when
*  they cast the ballot than when they answer a survey, that when they answer a survey,
*  it's an opportunity to express their frustration, their disappointment, which is obviously the
*  case about how people feel about this administration.
*  And it comes out in lots of other polls.
*  But then when they actually have to go and vote and actually look at the choice, it doesn't
*  match.
*  But that isn't really how it gets interpreted and written up.
*  Let me try to defend poll panic here for a minute.
*  Not my natural position, but I want to give it voice.
*  So the thing people say is, look, fair enough, the polls are predictive.
*  We actually know that polls a year out from an election are not predictive.
*  They have no better than a monkey throwing a dart accuracy.
*  But it is a snapshot.
*  And it's telling us things that need to be taken seriously.
*  And the thing specifically it is telling us is Joe Biden is a uniquely weak candidate.
*  According to the 538 polling average, his favorability rating is 38.5.
*  That's not great.
*  If you look at the New York Times Sienna poll, he's seeing, and I think this is both the
*  most striking and to me, the most questionable aspect of the poll, double digit erosion among
*  young voters and among black voters.
*  I mean, if that happens, he is toast.
*  And so there's some unique Joe Biden problem.
*  The polls snapshot, but the snapshot should make Democrats panic and dump Joe Biden.
*  That would be my case for polling panic.
*  Well, there's nothing in the New York Times survey that people who can do anything about
*  whether Joe Biden is on the ticket don't already know.
*  There's a massive amount of polling always going on in the Democratic Party and the Republican
*  Party and the groups that work with them.
*  There's no news in that survey that is a surprise to people who are doing this professionally.
*  This is known.
*  But I think the concern people have, the concern I hear from Democrats and including from some
*  elite Democrats, is that the Democratic Party is whistling past the graveyard.
*  You believe, and we're going to talk about this at some length, that Donald Trump poses
*  a unique threat to American democracy, that Donald Trump getting reelected in 2024 is
*  a cataclysm of genuinely historic dimensions.
*  And if that's true, if you believe that's true, then you really want to go into 2024
*  with your strongest candidate.
*  And if Democrats for a elite Democrats, informed Democrats, the people with the power to make
*  decisions in this space, people who you've been in these circles forever, if they're
*  refusing to admit what is right in front of their face because maybe it's bad for their
*  career, maybe it's socially awkward, maybe they don't want to be the first one to stick
*  their head up, although some have.
*  I mean, David Axelrod, who is Obama's chief strategist, has kind of said pretty clearly
*  he thinks Biden should step down and not run again, not step down from the presidency,
*  but from the campaign.
*  Are those Democratic elites are talking about making a terrible mistake right now that is
*  being revealed in this and other polls?
*  I think that this is the kind of original sin mistake which happened after Sanders won
*  the Nevada caucus.
*  And suddenly Biden wins everywhere.
*  He's the nominee, even though about 10 minutes before he looked really weak.
*  And the things that made him look weak in early 2020, to a certain extent, haven't gone.
*  But once you've been president for three years and there's a whole infrastructure around
*  you and there really isn't time, and this is why I think it's really unrealistic to
*  figure out who the next one is.
*  And so while I wish we weren't in a position where we are right now, I think that it's
*  the least bad place.
*  So something you suggest there is that Democratic elites just don't really have time or didn't
*  have time to do something else here.
*  And that doesn't feel really true.
*  I mean, it's still possible for your Gavin Newsom's of the world to go onto the ballot.
*  It does seem, and I mean, people in the party have said this, that there has been a push
*  to close ranks behind Joe Biden.
*  And I guess the question I have for you is, has that been the right strategy?
*  There was a lot of time.
*  This was not, nobody like lost time on the watch.
*  They made a choice.
*  And people are scared they made the wrong choice.
*  Do you think they made the wrong choice?
*  I feel like that's something I have no one could really have an idea on.
*  I don't offer that kind of advice.
*  I think it's a gamble.
*  And without knowing what the odds on the gamble were, how do you sort of answer that question?
*  I do think that is a little bit underplayed in this sometimes, that going with Biden is
*  dangerous.
*  I mean, going with an 80-year-old candidate has risks, who's not very popular.
*  And starting up a primary either against the incumbent president or having him step down
*  when his vice president is not that politically strong also could fracture the party.
*  And so I also don't, I felt that other people seem more certain on what Democrats should
*  have done here than I am, but I could see it going wrong both ways.
*  But the fact that it goes wrong one way doesn't mean it also wouldn't have gone wrong in the
*  other.
*  Now, let me flip the role I'm taking in this because I've looked at polling at about this
*  state in the race, about the state in the presidency for Trump, for Obama, for Clinton,
*  for George W. Bush, for, and the thing that strikes me about it is that if all I knew
*  were the polls, nothing I'm seeing with Joe Biden looks that weird.
*  I made a mistake.
*  I didn't bring these numbers in with me, but Mitt Romney was leading Barack Obama in polling
*  in 2011.
*  Hillary Clinton was dominating, absolutely stomping Donald Trump and Jeb Bush in polling.
*  You can go back to Reagan's first term.
*  You go back to Obama's first term.
*  You look at their approval ratings in the third year.
*  They're not great.
*  You know, depending on when you're looking, they're a little bit higher.
*  You can argue Biden is underperforming them by a point or two, but they now look like
*  incredibly successful politicians.
*  But in year three, they didn't seem that way.
*  In fact, Barack Obama in year three so didn't seem that way that his campaign polled taking
*  Joe Biden off of the ticket and replacing him with the electoral juggernaut of Hillary
*  Clinton.
*  And so I think the thing here that is sometimes hard for me to tell is whether incumbents
*  in their third year just kind of look a little rough before the whole artillery of the campaign
*  comes into play, or there's something distinctive about Joe Biden, maybe related to his age
*  and doubts voters have about that or something else about him that puts him in a weaker position
*  such that the rebound we have seen with other presidents is not as likely for him.
*  Yeah, I'm glad you brought that in because that sounds a little bit self-serving coming
*  from me.
*  But it's true.
*  Right now, a lot of people taking those surveys are expressing their disappointment with the
*  way the world is, not thinking about what the world might look like in 2025.
*  And that was true in all of the third years you're talking about.
*  It's in the DNA to have higher expectations for the person you're going to elect than
*  gets met.
*  And so I think there was a lot of unrealistic expectations generated.
*  But why are people so disappointed right now?
*  I mean, Biden's bad polling, his sort of drop to the low 40s, high 30s, it predates both
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine and very much predates the Hamas attacks and the war in
*  Gaza.
*  And if you look around for a while, the explanation was inflation, but inflation's been coming
*  down.
*  The labor market is actually pretty damn strong and has been that way for a while.
*  Wages are pretty good.
*  You wouldn't think people would be so pissed at the system.
*  I mean, COVID has calmed.
*  Compared to where we were just a couple of years ago, this feels like recovery.
*  This feels like I don't want to say feels like because clearly it doesn't feel like.
*  But if you looked at the numbers, you could really make a case for mourning in America.
*  So why are people so pissed?
*  Because they're not the right numbers to be looking at.
*  There's just the collapsing confidence in American institutions generally, and that
*  has been happening for the last 20 years at least.
*  Whoever is president is actually the head of one of those institutions that people have
*  lost faith in, which is why for three quarters of the time for Bush, Obama, Trump and Biden,
*  their approval ratings have been underwater except during the 9-11 bump and in the first
*  couple months after they get elected.
*  That is just the permanent state of presidential approval in the 21st century.
*  And so we're not seeing a different thing really.
*  On the numbers, I think that this is one of those situations where there's sort of zombie
*  heuristics, things like GDP growth.
*  That used to be a really good number because prosperity was shared.
*  So if GDP was going up, then you could be reasonably sure most people were feeling it.
*  But the less that that prosperity shared, the less good indicator it is.
*  Also in this period, the kinds of things that really matter to working people have gotten
*  a lot worse in terms of how much more precarious their employment is.
*  So if you make, say, 10 or 15 percent more, but you don't know what your hours are going
*  to be next week, you don't know whether you'll have a job in seven months, you don't feel
*  like someone telling you you just got a 15 percent raise is the whole story.
*  And similarly, if you have a family, if you don't feel like you're going to be able to
*  help your kids get a better life, that's just not going to be overcome by this month's unemployment
*  numbers.
*  And I think inflation is another area where there's this kind of data mismatch.
*  Inflation coming down is still rising prices.
*  And if you're in the bottom three quarters, that's an immense burden.
*  That's I think hard for people in this bubble to really appreciate that unlike a lot of
*  other problems, inflation is one that is in your head all the time because you don't
*  know whether you're going to have enough money for the prices that are going to be next month.
*  And so you just spend all this time in mental overhead.
*  That's unlike a more abstract problem.
*  I want to spend another moment on the democratic weakness and Biden's weakness among young
*  voters and voters of color.
*  The swing in the time stand poll is huge.
*  And so I get the point that it seems unlikely that would persist through an election.
*  But we've been seeing rising Republican support among nonwhite voters for a bit.
*  Biden's polling troubles among young voters have also been persistent.
*  Something real is happening here among two of the constituencies Democrats think of as
*  most reliable for them.
*  And it's consistent across enough polls that I think it should be taken seriously.
*  So what do you make of it?
*  I think that it is less about Trump becoming more popular and about the lack of enthusiasm
*  and disappointment that especially young voters feel for Biden.
*  One thing that I think most people probably can relate to is that often if you age into
*  the electorate at a time that John Kennedy becomes president or that Ronald Reagan becomes
*  president or that Barack Obama became president, that age cohort becomes very much attached
*  to that political party.
*  We're in this unusual place where the people coming of age are negatively seeing that.
*  They are coming of age in a way that they are turned off by Trump but not turned on
*  by Biden or other Democrats.
*  How about the nonwhite vote?
*  I think that there's a sort of academic or political observer expectation that whether
*  people vote for Democrats or Republicans is determined by someone's race.
*  And I think it's much more the case that it's determined by whether the campaign is making
*  salient issues that threaten that group identity.
*  And one of the most misunderstood things about the Latino vote between 2016 and 2020 where
*  there was this enormous drop for support between Hillary Clinton and for Joe Biden is that
*  there wasn't much change in the support for Joe Biden from House Democrats in 2016.
*  But if you remember in 2016, going after Trump's hostility to Mexican immigrants was
*  something she talked about a lot.
*  It was something that she did advertising on that other Democrats weren't.
*  And that among Latino voters, immigration was one of the top issues in multiple polls.
*  It was in the air.
*  And that activated a Latino identity.
*  Joe Biden had a different strategy, which was to try not to go near that.
*  But there are tradeoffs, right?
*  There's a way in which people who comment on politics don't realize almost everything
*  has a tradeoff.
*  The tradeoff of being quiet about activating group identities is that people in that group
*  start to vote for different reasons.
*  There's a great book called Steadfast Democrats that talks about how the black vote is always
*  so high because that's the only socially acceptable vote in that community because you always
*  are black in America.
*  But I think Latinos are more like every immigrant group before it.
*  And if you don't feel threatened, then if you were conservative, the reasons you didn't
*  you voted for the House Republican in 2016, but voted for Clinton, that's a lot of what's
*  going on.
*  And so in this theory, there would actually be a connection between why Joe Biden did
*  better among white voters in 2020, which was a very important margin in him winning and
*  why he's doing and did somewhat worse among non-white voters.
*  The media focus on what he lost, but you're actually saying they made it trade.
*  Absolutely.
*  If you look at Obama 12, Clinton 16 and Biden, they all ran about two points ahead of House
*  Democrats.
*  But Obama and Clinton did it by doing much better than House Democrats with Latinos and
*  blacks and worse with whites.
*  And Biden, it was sort of two points, whichever group you were in.
*  And that may have been part of the success, but it's a problem that the stories are only
*  that there are losses.
*  There are tradeoffs here.
*  So something that you said now a few times, that numbers we're seeing here are not that
*  unusual.
*  I'm just mad.
*  Presidents are typically now underwater, have been for some time.
*  It's been noted by political scientists that performance of the economy is decoupling from
*  presidential approval.
*  That was true for a bit now, too.
*  And that maybe Biden's age, which I think most of us take as a real potential weakness
*  for him.
*  But I wonder sometimes if it doesn't almost act as cover to make a normal situation look
*  abnormal.
*  So Biden's age is actually somewhat abnormal for a president that creates a kind of maybe
*  this time is different.
*  Maybe what we're seeing is more serious.
*  But if you weren't looking at it that way, maybe it all looks normal.
*  And something else that I think possibly adds into that sense is that if you look internationally,
*  the leaders of peer countries are very unpopular.
*  So my colleague David Brooks had a column where he says, Biden's 40% approval rating
*  may look bad, but in Canada, Justin Trudeau's approval rating is 36.
*  In Germany, Olaf Scholz is at 29.
*  In Britain, Rishi Sunak is at 28.
*  In France, Emmanuel Macron is at 23.
*  And in Japan, Fumio Kishida is also at 23.
*  Now these other leaders are not 80.
*  So something is happening that leaders who are in the center left and center right across
*  a pretty wide array of countries are not popular.
*  In fact, Joe Biden is the cleanest shirt in a dirty laundry there.
*  That's absolutely right.
*  And I think that matches what I was trying to express is that there is a sort of baseline
*  dissatisfaction with the way the world's going in all of these places.
*  And polling makes it easy to attach that disaffection to a particular person you ask about and ignore
*  that it's really about everything.
*  And that you couldn't put someone else in and have people suddenly forget all the things
*  that are making them grumpy about the world today.
*  But the act of making it seem like this could all change if we just had a different person
*  at the top of this is fantasy.
*  It's just fantasy.
*  And that's part of why I think it's a real problem that important media institutions
*  are trying to support the idea that our problems are as superficial as who we put on the ballot
*  as sort of different human beings when we need to solve the underlying institutional problems.
*  We've been talking about the polling.
*  And this was what was on my mind when I sent the invitation to you.
*  Then there was an election night last Tuesday.
*  And Democrats did pretty damn well, just as they did pretty damn well in 2022 in a way
*  that maybe if you had been looking at least broad national polling, how people feel about
*  Joe Biden, how they feel about the country, you wouldn't think the incumbent party politically,
*  at least the broad incumbent party politically, would be surviving that.
*  So what did you make of the 2023 specials we just saw?
*  Pretty much the same as you did that people understand can distinguish what's at stake
*  when they actually are deciding who they want than when they're answering surveys.
*  There's no real stakes.
*  But when the media takes those answers as a profound truth, it misses what's there's
*  just evidence piling up over and over and over again.
*  It's like the two plus two keeps equaling four, but they keep hoping it's going to equal
*  three.
*  And the problem is that this should be telling us they're not really mathematicians.
*  But it's like every time you roll out a new number, numbers just do something to people.
*  If someone just got up and said, I think Biden won't do well, it has a different effect than
*  when someone says, I think he's going to lose by four points or something or 4.5.
*  That's, I think, the difference.
*  Well, I think versus I have a representative national sample or a sample I have turned
*  representative through methodical demographic weighting are, to be fair, different ideas.
*  I don't think so.
*  Make this argument because you've made this argument and there's some truth to it.
*  I think that polling is a kind of punditry.
*  Why do you say that?
*  Right.
*  It's a different kind of opinion journalism now.
*  There was a time before phone response rates once so down that there was some scientific
*  basis to it.
*  It was basically probability theory.
*  But now there's no such thing as an actual random sample anymore.
*  And just to draw this out, the thing happening here at the end of the game in polling is
*  that the pollsters are making a prediction about who will come out to vote.
*  And so they're taking their interviews and then trying to make the demographics of their
*  interviews.
*  If you think you have half as many Hispanics in your sample as you believe will be in the
*  electorate, then you have to up weight the Hispanics in your sample.
*  But so every pollster is making maybe an informed guess, but a guess about who will show up
*  at the polls in the next election.
*  And without making that guess, those polls don't mean anything.
*  Correct.
*  So to me, one of the best pieces of data journalism ever was in The New York Times.
*  It's a great paper.
*  It is sometimes.
*  In September 2016, when there was another time survey of Clinton versus Trump in Florida,
*  and really genius, the 850 or so interviews were given blind to really respected pollsters,
*  pollsters who don't do spin, people who are serious, some in the middle, some on the left
*  and the right.
*  And the estimates, I think, were Clinton plus four, Clinton plus three, two plus ones, and
*  Trump plus one.
*  Right?
*  These are literally the same 850 interviews.
*  And it's in that arithmetic that everyone should see that, yeah, they're all making
*  a good faith effort to tell you what those 850 interviews mean, but they're not science
*  anymore.
*  There is a real and I think reasonable given what we traditionally think about as a relationship
*  between midterm performance and the president's approval rating belief that you would have
*  a just gigantic red wave in 2022, that it would be a historic wipeout for Democrats.
*  Inflation was terrible in 2022.
*  I mean, it was really bad and people blamed Joe Biden for it.
*  And then he just didn't.
*  Democrats did well in the Senate and kept it against many people's expectations.
*  They held losses down quite a bit in the House.
*  They didn't do that badly across governorships.
*  Why?
*  Maggath, because the way politics works in this country now has changed radically since
*  Trump was elected.
*  And coverage is pretty much what you just described, where you just expect that red
*  wave because it's always been that way.
*  Right?
*  And so when you do polling, whatever you're doing, you just are subject to a lot of confirmation
*  bias until it's disabused at the polls.
*  Right?
*  Voters have been making the choice of MAGA, no MAGA for several cycles now.
*  They know what's at stake.
*  So when you say MAGA, you mean Trumpist candidates, the kinds of candidates who buy
*  into his lies about 2020 or prior to 2020, the kinds of candidates who align themselves
*  with say the Trump faction of the party or his presidency over what you might think of
*  as traditional Republican candidates.
*  Correct.
*  20 years ago, if Herschel Walker had been on the ballot, he would have been wiped out.
*  Right?
*  He had just so many negatives, so many things that people probably wouldn't ever
*  count in that state.
*  And yet he almost won.
*  And even though I think John Fetterman is great, right?
*  And an important senator now.
*  Imagine 20 years ago, a candidate having a stroke win as comfortably as he did because
*  people understood that it wasn't just about who Pennsylvania's junior senator was going
*  to be.
*  They know this is closer to a parliamentary decision than it is way the two candidates
*  because Trump won and because of Dobbs.
*  Voters now understand that there's more to the difference than rhetoric.
*  So people hate it when I say this.
*  They hate it.
*  But I'm a party polarization guy and I believe it.
*  In most elections that are national, right?
*  House, Senate, to some degree presidency, though not only, voters would in general have
*  more information if you took the candidates names off the ballot.
*  Because in many ways, the candidates' efforts using consultants and polling and ads and
*  whatever to create idiosyncratic personal profiles built on their biography, built on
*  which kind of dog they have at home, their family story, et cetera, actually distracts
*  from the fact that the most important vote they cast, specifically House and Senate,
*  is for the leaders of the chamber.
*  And I used to say that like 10 years ago and people just loathed it.
*  But what you're saying is that voters increasingly act that way anyway.
*  Absolutely.
*  Don't count me as a hater here.
*  I mean, I wish that was the case.
*  If that was the case, we would not have had a Republican majority in the House because
*  if you think about the way in which every Senate race was covered as will Democrats,
*  Republicans control the Senate, then you think about how the House
*  races were covered where that never came in.
*  So the states that understood themselves as in a national election, right?
*  Understood themselves as doing something that would really matter for control,
*  treated it that way and Democrats held on.
*  And the states that didn't, I mean, California, the narrative in California was,
*  it's California, right?
*  Who cares?
*  Democrats win in California.
*  People didn't really seem to feel very empowered there and also weren't treated that way
*  in campaign spending.
*  Right.
*  Pennsylvania got blanketed.
*  Yeah, it's that.
*  But it's also that the media essentially is one of your haters because they really want to
*  preserve this Democratic folk myth that we should be looking at the two individual candidates and
*  watch how they debate and do all of those kinds of things rather than contextualizing those House
*  races as leading to Kevin McCarthy and then Mike Johnson.
*  That was in nobody's narrative ahead of the election.
*  Well, I think that's a little too far.
*  I think the idea that these House races would affect control of the House was not actually
*  a secret the media kept, but I do take your point.
*  People all over the country knew all about John Fetterman and Dr. Oz and that doesn't really
*  happen in House races, which I think has a real effect.
*  I do think the deterioration of local media and the nationalization of the media lowers
*  the bandwidth for people to kind of see the stakes and the intensity and what matters
*  in their local elections in a way that's a genuine problem.
*  100% that that is true and that is a very, very big problem.
*  Where it becomes more consequential is in a more subtle way, which is sort of dictating coverage
*  what's important to cover.
*  So in a lot of the stories about the elections in New York in October of
*  22, they were about crime and about inflation.
*  But when especially big institutions like the New York Times say, well, this poll says voters
*  are not caring as much about abortion and about inflation as they were because this one poll
*  told us that, you know, that has an effect on every assignment desk in the mainstream media.
*  Oh, we're not going to do another story about election deniers.
*  We're going to do the next one about people at grocery stores or whatever.
*  And it has a ripple effect.
*  Let's talk about abortion for a second, because I think one way of explaining a fair amount of
*  democratic performance is 2020.
*  Explaining what happened in 2022, explaining to some degree what happened in 2023 on Tuesday,
*  is simply to say, Dobbs.
*  And that Dobbs took the salience of abortion and the stakes of what it means for Republicans to be
*  in charge and turned, at least on that issue, which is a very important issue for people,
*  turned that from an abstraction to a tangible, real, lived experience.
*  I mean, people are now living.
*  And I think this is often underplayed.
*  People are living in the post-Dobbs world.
*  I mean, women in red states are living in states where abortion is criminalized.
*  And that fundamentally, it's like not all this anti-maga stuff necessarily.
*  It's Dobbs.
*  And really, the key thing the Democrats are doing is running on abortion.
*  So this is a both and for me.
*  I think that it is about the immediate effects on people's lives because of Roe being reversed.
*  But more broadly than that, it's a kind of shock to the system that all the things that Republicans
*  had been talking about wanting to do wasn't just rhetoric, that given the chance they would do it.
*  So you're an issue doesn't have to be abortion to be affected by Dobbs.
*  You're going to hear what a Republican politician says now differently than before Dobbs,
*  because now you can't discount it as just appealing to their base.
*  They're going to do it.
*  So I want to now open up into the broad Michael Bidhoser view of the world and elections and
*  what Democrats should do.
*  And there is a school of thought, sometimes gets called popularism has different names,
*  but it's a long running school of thought among Democrats.
*  And the problem with Democrats is that they are a bit too liberal and specifically don't talk enough
*  about the things that they do that people like, which are usually their more moderate
*  accomplishments and not only your view has been that that's missing the point and that there is
*  this anti MAGA majority out there and that strategy should flow from the question of how
*  you activate that majority, which we know exists because we saw it show up in 2020.
*  So at least parts of it show up in 2022 unexpectedly.
*  So let me start with this question just demographically.
*  What is the anti MAGA majority?
*  How is it different than just Democratic voters?
*  Right.
*  I don't think it has a demographic basis.
*  And as you know, I really think thinking about the electorate in demographic terms is one of the
*  biggest liabilities of the current conversation because right now, for the most part, when we
*  look at how demographic X is voting, it's a reflection of how many people who don't like
*  MAGA or love MAGA fall into that demographic.
*  If I say white non-college voter, probably everybody listening to this thinks of like a
*  burly guy, Bob in a Wisconsin diner who gets interviewed over and over again and seems pretty
*  Trumpy. Bob is the guy that the popularists want to win over. But if you pull the camera back from
*  that interview, first you see Charlene, who's reaching over the counter and pouring his coffee.
*  And Charlene is really upset about that. She'd been an infrequent voter, but now she's going to
*  be out again. And then you pull the camera back further and you see 320 something sitting in a
*  booth who don't trust anything any politician ever tells them. They haven't had a regular job yet.
*  There's an ambient anxiety about all the things that could go wrong. And now one or two of them,
*  because their friends says so, decides to vote. That's the anti MAGA majority. It's not
*  particularly demographic. They were all white non-college voters, but they have a different
*  place in the world and they have a different perspective. And other than Bob's, they feel
*  threatened by Trump and by what his allies want to do. If Donald Trump is truly so unappealing to
*  people, and he has a very known quantity, right? He is not the unknown governor of Missouri, who's
*  got a fast rise in the Republican party right now. People really do know he's under a bazillion
*  indictments. People really do know that there was this thing that happened on January 6th where he
*  and others like tried to execute a coup of the government and Trump's staying power, the fact
*  that he's risen up in let's call it snapshot polling, right? Polling of just how people are
*  answering today. Yeah, maybe they'd make a different decision if they were really in the
*  ballot booth. But I think a lot of people hope to see Trump polling at 34% now, right? After the last
*  couple of years. And instead he's polling ahead of Joe Biden. And that is making them wonder,
*  maybe that anti MAGA majority isn't there anymore. Maybe some things about Trump have faded into a
*  kind of nostalgia. People like the economy better. They don't really like Joe Biden.
*  And as such, like if that was there, then he wouldn't be pulling so high. And the fact that
*  he's pulling so high means that is no longer there. How do you think about that? So one thing is that
*  most accurately predicted Trump's disapproval numbers going down when he was president as if
*  for some reason he was out of the news. Yes. And right now, he is actually relatively out of the
*  news. The thing that people can't completely accomplish is think about how they will be
*  thinking about this after four trials, after a possible conviction, after an October where
*  he's just on the front of everything all the time. I would frame that a little bit differently.
*  I think the one thing Donald Trump is not is out of the news. I mean, if you go to the New York
*  Times on any day lately, it's a toss up on whether or not Donald Trump trials or the war in Gaza is
*  leading the page. What I do think is that people are not hearing from him directly anymore that
*  much. In a weird way, one of the best things to happen to Trump was getting banned from every
*  major social media service and then him deciding to stick to truth social rather than go back to
*  X now that he is unbanned because I do think when Donald Trump is talking directly to people,
*  that's very exciting for his people. But for a lot of other people, it's very, very, very upsetting
*  and creates a very powerful backlash effect. And at the same time, to just basically reiterate the
*  question or poke you a little bit more on it, it implies people are very short-memoried to say that
*  after the intensity of the experience that the Donald Trump presidency was and how no one a
*  quantity he is that all of these people who have suddenly started saying, yeah, I'll go for that
*  guy again, or I'll go for that guy at all have just forgotten the vibes that Donald Trump
*  creates in them when he actually has access to his phone in a full suite of apps.
*  So I think a really good poke, I think it helps bring another aspect to this out that we were
*  talking about before about this being bigger than individual candidates, right? That they're really,
*  especially over the last dozen years since the 2010 election, half of the country has been going
*  in the opposite direction from the other half of the country in big ways, whether it's you get a
*  higher minimum wage, you don't, you can have abortion, you can't up and down the line, state
*  legislates said they become different worlds to live in. And that's the baseline for it being so
*  close is now it's not just do I think we should go this direction or that direction? It's do I want
*  to keep what I have or lose it because the other party now is in charge nationally. And that's what
*  gets him from 34 to 42 or 43 or whatever it is.
*  Let me give you my personal explanation for some of this, you do a lot of media criticism
*  on your sub stack in your conversations with me, you're not always a fan of our reporting.
*  But one of my views is that the single biggest divide in media and politics is not left right,
*  it's interested, uninterested. And that the people who are not that interested in politics
*  have actually become functionally unimaginable to the people who are like how much you can really
*  not know about politics, not care how distant it can really be from your life. If you never read
*  the news, which is true for a whole lot of people, even a whole lot of people who vote really, really
*  rarely come into contact, much less choose to come into contact with political news. I think a lot of
*  when I read you a lot of things come down to the media should cover this thing differently. But the
*  experience of being in the media is that for a lot of the people who you might care if they
*  read that we were covering a thing differently, like they are persuadable, they are soft in their
*  views, we're not reaching them. They're not coming to the homepage. They're not looking for
*  editorials to see what we think about things and like what the level of strident is. And that the
*  big unsolved question actually for everybody, whether you're a popularist, whether you're an
*  anti-maga, you know, how do you reach people you're not reaching? Like how does a message get to
*  somebody who like hates politics and hates the news and doesn't care what any of us are saying
*  and weirdly doesn't even listen to this podcast? It's unimaginable. As hard as it is to believe.
*  Yeah, I think that is a really, really important question. I agree that most people really would
*  rather not hear the news at all and do not go searching it out. And this is also just to sweep
*  it back in part of what it was my critique of popularism visit. It depends on the belief that
*  if a politician says something, someone will hear it and believe it. And that just is not the world
*  we live in. But what does happen is that the media, especially an institution as big as New York Times
*  has a ripple effect. You're not reaching that person that is not paying attention to you directly.
*  But you're creating the information reality environment that maybe one or two steps removed
*  the people they trust about what's going on in the world. That's how they organize their thinking.
*  And part of the reason that even at right as Dobbs was about to be overturned, polling wasn't
*  showing people were going to care about it anywhere near as much as they ended up caring
*  about it. Is that when you take a survey, and they say, well, if it's overturned, what will you do?
*  They can't factor in what will I do when my two best friends go crazy over it? And are telling me
*  all the time, we've got to go to this rally, or that candidate is going to mean this. It's not a
*  direct pipeline from the New York Times to that person in the diner. But there will be someone in
*  those people's lives who's influenced. And that's the same thing for Fox. Not that many people
*  actually watch the literal Fox. But that reality bubble goes through all the different social
*  networks and creates a reality. I do think this is a pretty important point. I've been thinking a lot
*  about this with world events over the past year and a half, two years. For a while, it was
*  very plausible and began to seem clearer and clearer that Russia was going to invade Ukraine.
*  And one of the things that I observed in that as somebody who was part of the world who began to
*  realize this was going to happen, was even knowing that and following the news on it closely,
*  I had trouble projecting myself correctly forward into the structure of emotion, the structure of
*  feeling that would follow that event. I knew it would be a big deal. I knew we would have to cover
*  it. But when it happened, it was so seismic. And the experience people had watching it on social
*  media was so intense that just knowing that Russia was going to invade Ukraine and we were not going
*  to like it did not describe the reality was going to happen at all. I think that if you describe
*  to people that there would be a huge Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and then a huge Israeli
*  air bombing and siege and then invasion of Gaza, that people would correctly have told you I would
*  be very upset about that. That would make me, I would not like that world event to happen and it
*  would have been much better if it had not happened. But the level of intense feeling for a lot of
*  people after they see their friends weeping in Instagram stories and their Jewish friends posting
*  stories and their Jewish friends posting that anti-Semite that it was not really people are not
*  capable of like throwing themselves forward into different emotional realities and they inhabit.
*  It's actually something I've learned about programming the show. Some of you just have to
*  let the emotional hit happen. And this is just something we don't know how to work with. And
*  it's a reason that I don't buy the argument exactly that because the polls were right about
*  the 2023 elections, they're also right about Biden because campaigns create a different
*  emotional reality for people. They're so overwhelmed with anger and emotion and
*  intensity and outrage and coverage for like a year that by the end of that they feel differently
*  and feeling matters in politics. Yes, that's what I'm trying to say is that why-
*  I'm just agreeing with you. Okay. No, that's why you haven't heard me
*  really ever criticize a particular poll, right? Because my point is that the things they say
*  they're trying to tell us can't be told by it. It's a methodological limitation,
*  right? Just like you just described. You cannot expect human beings to understand
*  and project forward what they're going to think when something happens.
*  I'm going to ask you about another piece of this, which is I think that we are still a little bit
*  trapped in an older version of politics, which is defined by who we like when modern politics is
*  defined by who we hate and who we fear. And like the political science term for this is
*  positive polarization versus negative polarization, right? Do I like Joe Biden?
*  That's one reason to vote for Joe Biden. Do I hate Donald Trump? That's a reason to vote for Joe
*  Biden too. And I have to think of Joe Biden and the Democrats in this era as working with
*  negative polarization very effectively and positive polarization very ineffectively.
*  Like they're not very good at getting people to like them, but they're good at channeling
*  the fear and anger people have at the Republican party. And it very much strikes me that your kind
*  of anti-maga theory is basically negative polarization as a full-on campaign theory.
*  Just like take seriously that the strongest motivator for anti-Trump voters is negative.
*  They don't have to like Joe Biden. They have to fear Donald Trump. And that might be a much more
*  achievable goal for not just Democrats to achieve, but Donald Trump himself to achieve.
*  Because like nobody's better at making people fear Donald Trump than Donald Trump.
*  Absolutely. I think that's exactly right. I think that the perspective I bring to this is not as a
*  party partisan. It's about preserving what will be taken away if they win. And so I see this as sort
*  of separate from traditional electoral politics. It's about civil society wherever you are on an
*  ideological spectrum. So I'm not really offering advice to the Democratic party. I'm offering
*  advice to people who want a Democrat X, small D future that we shouldn't have to rely on a
*  political party to defeat this kind of movement. It's up to us ourselves to go out and defeat it.
*  Let me ask you about another narrative you've been, I think it is fair to say, cranky and annoyed by.
*  Which is, there's been a move to say in recent years, like the dominant and rising form of
*  polarization is educational polarization. The Democratic party has begun doing much better
*  among college educated voters than it used to. Republican party much worse. Republicans are
*  doing much better among working class voters than they used to. Democratic party quite a bit worse.
*  This has also led in the telling of some to shifting dynamics around racial voting. Republicans
*  have been doing better with Hispanic and black voters, even in the Trump era than people expected.
*  Democrats have been making gains among white voters. Like that's a big violation of the
*  narratives, I think, as they were coheering in 2016. And you can correct me if I'm wrong,
*  but my understanding is you believe this is actually misguided. And the thing to focus on
*  is religious polarization. So tell me why. The conversation we've had so far describes
*  the actual dominant polarization in this country, which is between a kind of MAGA future
*  and not that future. That is actually what's polarizing us. And 50 years ago, you would not
*  be talking about education polarization. You would just be talking about the actual divide happening
*  in the world, which is really clear to see. And I do think that in a lot of ways, whether or not
*  you have a degree in this country is devastating in terms of your economic prospects and many other
*  things. It's really important, but it's not what's making this big rip. And the reason you raise the
*  religious is that within, let's just stick with white voters for a minute, within white voters,
*  do you call someone who is a political evangelical, a non-college voter, or a religious
*  evangelical when you're trying to explain their voting behavior? I think obviously as a religious
*  evangelical, they're part of an actual movement. They go to church every week. They listen to
*  Christian broadcasting. There's no non-college broadcasting network. And if you pull that out,
*  if you divide white voters, which I don't think is the best way to do it, but you get a way better
*  result than education, if you divide it into those who on a survey say they're Christian
*  and those who don't, the partisan voting gap is much bigger. That's what's much more clarifying.
*  And a white non-college voter in a blue state actually supported Biden at a higher level
*  than a white college voter in a red state. I want you to go a bit deeper on this though,
*  because I think you're underselling how strident the charts I am receiving from you on this topic
*  have been. One of the cases you've been making, I think this is a reasonable description, is that
*  Trumpism is fundamentally at this point powered by religious evangelical voters. And not just
*  Mike Johnson becoming speaker. That one way to describe what's happening is MAGA. But when you
*  ask how is MAGA happening, the answer is that it has developed an extraordinarily potent base
*  among one of the few truly organized voter groups in America, which is religious evangelicals.
*  So make that case to me that something distinctive is happening there that you cannot understand
*  American politics without understanding. The case I'm trying to make is that the backlash
*  against Obama, what got reported as the Tea Party, was anti-Republicans who are willing to accept the
*  legitimacy of Obama as president. When McCain, like every other losing president before him,
*  and did a gracious speech immediately after and even noted what a step forward it was that Obama
*  was, it was kind of a breaking point within the Republican coalition where the sort of business
*  interests had been in the driver's seat, the religious interests had been going along and
*  delivering their votes for them. Just flipped. They're clustered in congressional districts.
*  It only took about 55,000 votes to defeat rhino incumbents in those districts. So that now about
*  three-fourths of the caucus, Republican caucus, is from the most evangelical districts in the country.
*  That political potential was activated. And so one thing you're arguing here is that there's been an
*  important base in the Republican Party, right? Evangelicals have been important there for a long
*  time, but they stopped going along and instead began to use their concentration in certain areas
*  to functionally take over the party. I mean, your argument, again, particularly around Mike Johnson,
*  is that he represents the successful takeover of this party, not because most Republican voters
*  are from this faction, but because it actually didn't need that many Republican House members,
*  for instance, who just would refuse to go along with anybody who wasn't of their faction in order
*  to bring the entire House to a halt, in order to destroy Speaker McCarthy. So give me a bit more
*  on that. Like how was this group behind McCarthy's downfall and Johnson's rise?
*  So what happens is that partly a result of geographic sorting, partly a result of
*  gerrymandering, right? Out of the 435 districts, 390 of them are just safe, okay? And so the only
*  competition happens in primaries, which are very low turnout and never covered by the national media,
*  right? This has all been happening in plain sight. No one has paid attention to it.
*  But what it means is that if, say, a third or 40%, even that little, in a congressional district are
*  evangelical voters and the turnout in primaries is very low, they're most certain to be a majority
*  of the people voting. And if they are going even 80-20 for your primary challenger to the incumbent,
*  that's pretty unstoppable, right? Such a sort of hackable part of our election system,
*  if you have clustered concentrated strength in safe districts.
*  So now I want to ask you about another faction that has been traditionally very important in
*  politics now on the Democratic side, which you have very specific experience with, which is labor.
*  So you're the longtime political director, as you mentioned, of the AFL-CIO. You retired from that
*  fairly recently. I'd say around the same time, labor has gone through a huge resurgence in a lot
*  of the country. I'm not saying those two events are related. I would have left earlier. Yeah, sure.
*  But there is something happening. There's very big strikes being threatened and one,
*  Joe Biden is very pro-labor president. What do you understand to be happening?
*  For quite a while, there was a feeling of fairly helplessness that working people felt. And part
*  of it was the result of either the outright hostility of Republican administrations
*  or the consequences of the lukewarm support and often bigger policy problems of Democratic
*  administrations and the combination of COVID and the disruptions and Biden being more clearly and
*  assertively on the side of working people. Those are all pieces of a realization that maybe there's
*  a lot of latent power in working people that no one had been exercising. And one of the things
*  about a resurgence is that they're almost always historically contagious. I'm sure people have seen
*  how 70% of people now support unions in this country and 10% are in them. It's not because
*  they don't like unions. It's because of all the things that have been done to keep people from
*  being in unions. And those are very real things. You are afraid of losing your jobs. You're afraid
*  of retaliation. You're afraid of all of these things. And so there are upsurges in union success
*  when working people see other working people succeed. So that implies you're actually giving
*  Biden quite a bit of credit here. That in being as pro-union as he is, you're saying that in
*  addition to other factors like a tight employment market and so on, that that really has been
*  emboldening even without Democrats passing major union law reform. Without getting too much in the
*  weeds, the standard operating procedure for a corporation when confronted with a potential
*  strike had been to basically just drag their feet to count on public attention going away quickly,
*  to count on the regulators, giving them delays on unfair labor practices and things like that.
*  And by simply agreeing to enforce the law the way it was written is a big pushback right now.
*  Right. It's not enough to undo all the reasons certain sectors of the economy can't be organized
*  and a lot of other important things. But this really may be the first time since the 60s that
*  the playing field is at level. Yeah, I was going to ask this. Is it sufficient for an actual
*  resurgence? Because on the one hand, they're very high profile fights being won, but they're
*  primarily being won by already unionized workforces. I mean, when you look at the UAW strike,
*  I mean, that is an existing union. When you look at what's happening with UPS, with the screenwriters
*  or the actors, those are existing unions. So we haven't seen anything like the unionization of the
*  Las Vegas hotel workers under Unite here. Right. There hasn't been a big new industry, a big new
*  corporate chain unionized to my knowledge. So is that kind of new unionization surge, right?
*  Something that would actually change in a positive way the percentage of Americans who belong to a
*  union. Is that possible under the current legal regime, even with a friendly democratic president?
*  I think the most straightforward answer is to return to the kind of union density that existed
*  in the 1930s and 40s and 50s and 60s. The rules have to be as good. I think one of the most thrown
*  off phrases whenever this topic comes up is the decline of the union movement or declining union
*  membership, which is really a misdirection because really from the mid 40s, right after the war,
*  there's been a relentless campaign by business to make sure that there aren't more union members
*  and it keeps succeeding. I think there's a way in which people say, boy, when are we going to get
*  those good manufacturing jobs back? In the 1930s, they were as bad as the service sector jobs. What
*  made them in our memory good was that union representation got what was needed. And so then
*  you get to gig workers. And this is where the democratic party's been complicit in passing
*  things that prevent them from organizing because they're quote independent contractors. So,
*  but if you think about the writer's guild strike, there's a group of people who you would really
*  think would see themselves as independent contractors. The idea that people who are
*  Uber drivers want to be individuals and the writers of hit TV series don't is nuts, but it
*  can't happen because we now have rules and laws that prevent them from organizing.
*  So what are the electoral effects of this rising, at least in public opinion and political salience,
*  labor movement? Does this actually affect the election or is this a sort of separate
*  thing happening in American life? I think that it will have definitely have an effect.
*  People have commented on Trump doing better in 2016 with union members than Obama had. Part of it
*  was because of union members feeling like they just hadn't gotten enough. I mean, this is something
*  I was actually very in the middle of. And for many of those conservative unions that were,
*  that was always a risk. Business has been great in the construction trades and having been to
*  local meetings and others, a completely different dynamic in the room, right? It used to be,
*  if someone wanted to talk politics, a guy with a MAGA hat would get up and be belligerent,
*  much harder for that person to do that right now because like work is great. So I think that's one
*  possible impact. If you're going to get any labor law reform, you're going to need Joe Biden or
*  some other Democrat reelected or elected in 2024. I think Donald Trump is not going to do it.
*  Joe Biden and his campaign, the Democrats have a certain amount of running room. They have strategic
*  decisions to make. You are a relentless and pissed off critic of a lot of the people who have ideas
*  there. You don't like the idea that Democrats should moderate. You don't like the idea that
*  the thing they should do is try to pull what their most popular ideas are and just talk about that.
*  So give me your positive perspective. You're chief strategist on these campaigns.
*  What do you tell Democrats to do? One of the most important things that Democrats can do,
*  which they did do in 2022, is do what they were elected to do. That the fact that the House
*  Democrats were able to pull together and do such important January 6 hearings,
*  it's both giving people the information they need and it's showing that they're actually
*  responsible in doing their job. Right now, we see a similar kind of thing happening with
*  the corruption stuff at the Supreme Court. It may not seem like it's exactly in what you're asking,
*  but it really is because it really is the job of the Senate Democrats to make sure that voters
*  understand what's going on properly. And then they'll be doing their job in a way that isn't
*  partisan political and absolutely necessary. And I think beyond that, I think it's just running as
*  responsible public officials. Basically, make no unforced errors.
*  I think that is a good place to end. Always our final question. What are three books you'd recommend
*  to the audience? My first recommendation is an essay that you can get online. It's by George
*  Orwell and it's called Politics in the English Language. I think that the way we talk about all
*  these things makes us less able to solve all problems and we'd just be better to have honest
*  conversation. Second one will be kind of maybe unusual. There's a new book called Tyranny, Inc.
*  by someone who endorsed Trump before, but actually looked at the modern American
*  labor situation and sees clearly what someone in the labor movement or someone who's actually
*  paying attention to what work life is like, how it's basically a dictatorship. You have no rights.
*  It's just really surprising. This is Sora Bumari's book. Michael Bud Horitz, political director of
*  the AFL-CEO recommending a Sora Bumari book. I never have expected it. That's exactly what I did,
*  but because it's built on some work by an academic, Elizabeth Anderson, who really
*  brought attention to how we have a first amendment in the public square and no right whatsoever in
*  the work, all of those things. I think it's really surprising and important that it's coming not from
*  someone, the AFL-CIO. And the third is one actually that you brought to my attention, which is the
*  book Crashed by Adam Tooze, which I think should open the aperture for people about how
*  our economy, all of these decisions are connected to the world in a way that makes everything make
*  a lot more sense. Michael Bud Orzer, thank you very much. Thank you.
