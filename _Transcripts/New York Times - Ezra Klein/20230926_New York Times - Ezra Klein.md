# Two Attorneys Rank the Severity of Trumpâ€™s Indictments
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [September 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6fvW6WCsWc)
*  From New York Times Opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Hey it is Ezra.
*  I am on book leave, but our guest this week is my colleague, The Times Opinion columnist
*  David French, whose work I have learned a ton from and who is just way of comporting
*  himself in public life I've often quite admired.
*  He began his career as a lawyer.
*  He has deployed with the US military.
*  He's the author of many books, including Divided We Fall, America's Secession Threat and How
*  to Restore Our Nation.
*  And I'm excited to see what he does here behind the mic.
*  I hope you enjoy it too.
*  I met Ken White the first day of law school.
*  We bonded immediately.
*  We are both Star Trek nerds.
*  We are both already losing our hair.
*  And we are both fascinated by criminal and constitutional law.
*  Neither of us ever lost that fascination.
*  And Ken went on to become one of the nation's most respected legal voices on both the criminal
*  justice system and the First Amendment, which is why I wanted to have him on the show today.
*  As much as I love to talk about free speech, this conversation is going to focus on criminal
*  justice, specifically the four cases against Donald Trump.
*  Most recently, we've had the sweeping Georgia indictment regarding Trump's efforts to overturn
*  the election.
*  Before that, we had the more narrow federal January 6 case, which also focused not just
*  on January 6, but Trump's efforts to overturn the election.
*  And before then, we had the Florida case involving the handling of classified documents relating
*  to the national defense.
*  And last and least, we have the Stormy Daniels hush money case.
*  Ken has unique insight into all these cases as a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor.
*  He can dive into both the prosecution and defense strategies in all four cases against
*  Trump.
*  Where are they strong?
*  Where are they weak?
*  Has the prosecution or defense made any mistakes?
*  If you find Ken insightful, and I know you will, you can hear more from him on his own
*  podcast co-hosted by Josh Barrow called Serious Trouble.
*  And you can read him at a sub stack called The Po Pat Report.
*  As always, you can email the show at Ezra Klein Show at nytimes.com.
*  Ken White, welcome to the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Thank you so much for having me, David.
*  It's great to talk to you.
*  Well, I'm really looking forward to this episode.
*  One of the goals is to help listeners be conversant in the big issues in each one of the criminal
*  cases against Donald Trump.
*  This is not about diving in deep, deep, deep into the details because each of these cases
*  are going to ultimately end up with records running in the thousands of pages.
*  There's going to be twists and turns.
*  This is much more of a broader view.
*  And we're going to be ambitious.
*  We're going to walk through each one of the four major criminal cases against Trump in
*  the reverse order of their filing.
*  So we're going to start with Georgia, then we're going to go with Jack Smith, January
*  6th case, then we'll go with Jack Smith documents case out of Mar-a-Lago, and then we'll end
*  up with the brag indictment out of Manhattan.
*  And the goal is to hit what are the big issues?
*  What's the prosecution sort of best case?
*  What is the defense's best case?
*  Which case is most dangerous to Donald Trump and why?
*  So Ken, let's start with Georgia.
*  You have a career as a prosecutor, a federal prosecutor.
*  You have a career in defense.
*  You've been on both sides here.
*  So I'm going to ask you to put on your both sides hat and let's sort of start with Georgia.
*  Talk a bit about how ambitious this case is and why.
*  How is it that prosecutors may arguably have more flexibility here in the Georgia case
*  than maybe in the federal cases?
*  Well, David, the Georgia Rico case is a lot more ambitious and a lot broader because they
*  are very deliberately cobbling together a bunch of different conspiracies into one big
*  charge.
*  So that's, I guess, what Rico is designed to do to allow prosecutors to take on organizations
*  and groups of people that are doing diverse things wrong and tie it all into one charge
*  or one set of charges.
*  So what's really notable about the Georgia Rico indictment is how it takes a bunch of
*  different what you would normally call different conspiracies to do different things allegedly
*  wrong in connection with the election.
*  People who are not interacting with each other.
*  When you and I were taking criminal law back in the last millennium, this would be described
*  as different spokes on the wheel.
*  People who are completely disconnected from each other, all doing illegal things towards
*  sort of a general goal.
*  And that winds up putting together a lot of people who don't seem like they really go
*  together in terms of what they're doing and putting together some pretty wildly different
*  conduct, which is why you're seeing some very strong motions to sever out defendants in
*  Georgia.
*  That's one way the indictment there is different.
*  The other way it's different is that it reflects a very different sensibility about the politics
*  of it.
*  So we'll talk more about the DC indictment by Jack Smith, but that one reflected a sensibility
*  that we're going to very explicitly say some things Donald Trump was allowed to do and
*  were legitimate and that's fine.
*  But these things were illegitimate.
*  The Georgia Rico indictment just leans into everything, throws it all in the same pile,
*  does not make much of an effort to explain or advocate about the distinction between
*  legal politics and illegal fraud.
*  One question about the Georgia.
*  So Enrico, you're somewhat famous online for many reasons.
*  One of them is for loathing Rico and maybe not necessarily loathing Rico, but loathing
*  overuse of Rico.
*  But there's some interesting distinctions here between Georgia Rico and federal Rico.
*  Could you walk through some of these differences between the Georgia Rico statutes and the
*  federal Rico statutes and why the prosecutor here might have thought that Rico was in fact
*  an appropriate method for charging this case?
*  So federal Rico, you know, originally designed to go after organized crime is very rule bound,
*  very picky, very complicated.
*  So every crime or cause of action in the civil case has its elements, its building blocks,
*  like the recipe for all the things you have to do to prove this particular crime.
*  The Rico elements are extremely convoluted and lengthy and few cases actually make it.
*  And it's so common for civil litigants to bring civil Rico charges as sort of an exclamation
*  point or basically an emoji.
*  This is really serious.
*  It's Rico in fact, that many federal judges have special Rico orders.
*  It's like, so you think it's Rico?
*  Well, here's a sheet with 20 questions I have for you that by the time you're done answering
*  them will show it's not Rico.
*  The federal Rico charges are characterized by how hard it is to prove and how complicated
*  it is.
*  And that's why you don't see it in a lot of federal cases because there's so many more
*  flexible and straightforward federal criminal tools.
*  The Georgia statute is a different story.
*  The Georgia courts have not imposed a lot of this sort of rule bound elements type of
*  approach.
*  They've taken it more like a general conspiracy without a lot of complicated requirements.
*  And a lot of the Georgia court of appeals opinions considering Rico convictions are
*  kind of frighteningly, that sort of sounds like what the statute's about, not imposing
*  a lot of technical requirements on it.
*  So that makes it very appealing as sort of a super conspiracy statute.
*  As a result, it is used astoundingly broadly in Georgia.
*  Rico is used in Georgia the way conspiracy is used in many other locations.
*  And it's used in a way that I think in my view is intentional to make cases that are
*  functionally impossible to defend.
*  So you have cases that go on for months and months and months.
*  You know how expensive litigation is, David, as well as anybody.
*  And very few people can afford lawyers for months and months and months, let alone also
*  not working because you're in trial.
*  So you have things like this trial of the rapper Young Thug and some people accused
*  of being in a gang with him.
*  It's been going on for eight months, doesn't even have a jury picked yet.
*  The case where Fulton County DA Fonny Willis went after a education cheating scandal,
*  that was treated as a Rico and those trials, the one that went to trial went on for like
*  six, seven months.
*  So it allows the prosecutors to put together big functionally impossible to defend cases.
*  So first I want to ask you what you think about the wisdom of this charging approach
*  in this case.
*  Because one thing I think listeners need to know is that often prosecutors overcharge
*  as a deliberate strategy that they're going to, as I've used this illustration before,
*  they throw charges in an indictment like you might throw croutons on a salad, which then
*  creates this incredible list of charges with lengthy prison sentences attached to convictions.
*  And essentially you take a defendant who may not have an enormous number of resources,
*  and you put them in this incredibly difficult box, which is if you go to trial on this monster
*  of an indictment, you cannot even begin to imagine the amount of jail time you could
*  face or I have this little plea deal for you here.
*  That's a lot better that you're not going to face nearly the kind of prison terms that
*  you could potentially face with a jury.
*  And we can just get all this settled and deal with this and move on to the next case.
*  And that kind of approach isn't applicable here for Trump, maybe for the others, but
*  for Trump that's not applicable.
*  So what do you think of the wisdom of this charging approach?
*  I think there is definitely an element of politics here.
*  So the DA of Fulton County is an elected position.
*  There are political overtones to the whole thing.
*  It's an ambitious DA.
*  Those are the circumstances in which big ambitious cases get brought.
*  I think that this is designed to be a case that is functionally impossible to be defended
*  the way it's charged.
*  You simply can't take 19 aggressive people with aggressive lawyers to trial on a giant
*  case at once.
*  It would go for years, particularly when you've got personalities like Rudy Giuliani and Donald
*  Trump in the same indictment that's just going to make it go even more circus like.
*  And the judge presiding over this has already basically pointed this out.
*  So I think it's a great way, great's the wrong word, effective way for a prosecutor
*  to coerce a lot of the smaller players in the case to plead guilty or even to cooperate,
*  to flip.
*  I think it's a great way to get on the scoreboard and to bring attention to the charges and
*  eventually wind up with something less.
*  I don't know if it's like if your purpose is to identify what Donald Trump did wrong
*  and come up with the just result if it's necessarily the right way.
*  This is a very typical state prosecutor tactic.
*  Do you think there's an overreach here?
*  Well this is maybe partially a matter of style or taste, but I prefer the approach that Jack
*  Smith took in DC to be very explicit about the things that Donald Trump did that were
*  permissible and legal and part of legitimate politics and litigation and then leaning into
*  explaining very much what wasn't and identifying, calling those things out as opposed to the
*  approach Fannie Willis took which is much more throw it all in there and call out everything
*  and really not make an effort to kind of avoid the appearance of attacking protected speech
*  or protected politics.
*  So I think because all of this, it's not a normal criminal case.
*  This has historic implications.
*  It's going to have a greatly exaggerated impact on the way Americans understand the legal
*  system and criminal justice system and that type of thing.
*  And so to kind of go this kitchen sink approach to me, I think risks diminishing the credibility,
*  the whole enterprise of holding Donald Trump accountable for things that he did that were
*  illegal.
*  Now there's another aspect of this case that I think is interesting and that is we've talked
*  about the RICO aspect, but there's a lot of charges that are related to specific Georgia
*  statutes that prohibit lying to public officials.
*  And these Georgia statutes are different from the federal statutes that Jack Smith charged
*  on January 6th.
*  And it strikes me, Ken, and I'd love your thoughts on this, that these statutes are
*  easier to prosecute because what they're essentially doing, if you look at some of these statutes,
*  they essentially say this, if I lie to you, let's say you're a public official and I lie
*  to you about a material fact and it's within your jurisdiction, on a matter within your
*  jurisdiction.
*  So if you're the secretary of state and I'm lying to you about voter fraud and I'm talking
*  to you in your capacity as secretary of state on a matter within your jurisdiction, I've
*  committed a crime.
*  I've committed a crime.
*  I don't have to show that I had an intent, for example, to deprive someone of their civil
*  rights or an intent to defraud the federal government.
*  It's just the lying about the material fact to a public official within their jurisdiction,
*  crime.
*  That seems to be, in my view, the absolute strongest element of this indictment.
*  Well, sure.
*  It's probably also the element that carries the lowest possible sentence of all the different
*  charges and rightly so because we shouldn't heavily punish things that don't actually
*  have a bad impact.
*  I think you're right.
*  And I think that the Georgia statute seems to have a very loose concept of materiality.
*  That is, how much does your lie matter?
*  And in both cases, it seems to be, is the lie the sort of thing that could hypothetically
*  matter in a scenario we can imagine, which is pretty easy to prove?
*  So yeah, a lot of the smaller things, the lesser charges are there that I think are
*  going to be easier to prove, even given how loosey goosey George O'Rico is.
*  That's one of the reasons that prosecutors throw those in a lot of the time is you're
*  looking for the jury to be sort of saying, okay, well, this big one's complicated.
*  Let's just compromise by convicting these easy ones and throwing out the big one or
*  something like that.
*  And that's strategically why they do it a lot of the time.
*  So let's talk about this word that has been mentioned an enormous amount as soon as the
*  January 6th prosecution started.
*  Intent.
*  Intent.
*  Yes.
*  I think I've seen more internet arguments about intent in the last two months than I'd
*  seen in the preceding 20 years.
*  But let's talk about the intent element in Georgia.
*  And then by golly, we're going to talk about the intent element in the federal case.
*  So if you're trying to describe what is the intent that prosecutors are going to have
*  to show in Georgia, how would you describe it, both for the more simple statute that
*  we just outlined and for sort of the bigger RICO and conspiracy charges?
*  And then we'll table for a minute exactly the intent in the Jack Smith January 6 cases.
*  But what's a brief summary of the intent element here in Georgia?
*  So it really varies charge to charge.
*  On the false statement type of charges, you've got just a requirement that you knowingly
*  lie.
*  So you have to say something and know it's a lie.
*  You don't necessarily have to have an intent that's fraudulent, an intent to deceive.
*  You just have to know that the thing you're saying is untrue.
*  The RICO and conspiracy and some of the other things that sound more like obstruction are
*  going to require some sort of specific wrongful intent and agreement to violate the law and
*  agreement to do something wrong.
*  So generally the more sophisticated the crime, usually the more sophisticated the mental
*  state.
*  So some of the crimes are just going to have to show people knew they were lying.
*  Others are going to have to show that they had fraudulent intent, the intent to deceive
*  or defraud.
*  Some are going to have to show that they intentionally joined an agreement to do something against
*  the law.
*  They agreed to commit a crime.
*  So it depends on the particular charge there.
*  So if we go, let's say the simple lying charge, you don't have to prove that Trump knew he
*  lost even if he genuinely thought he'd won, if he genuinely thought that Georgia was his.
*  But if he's told a lie in making that case, he can be convicted.
*  Whereas the more broader the conspiracy and the RICO charges, you're going to have to
*  show some intent beyond the simple lie.
*  Right.
*  And this is something where I think that all of us who are in the business of being pundits
*  and talking about all this have probably overcomplicated it a little bit.
*  We've been talking about for years how hard it is to prove intent or knowledge in Donald
*  Trump's case because of how he processes facts and how he views things and how he doesn't
*  really sort of see life from truth or distinguish it the way that we mortals do.
*  But it's easy to overcomplicate this.
*  You don't have to show that he knew he lost anything.
*  You only have to show, even if he believed he won, that he pursued that goal through
*  fraudulent means, that he tried to get people to violate their oaths of office, that he
*  tried to get people to do things that were illegal or that he lied to them in the pursuit
*  of that.
*  That's much easier.
*  It's easy because there's a big difference between the public narrative of what happened
*  after the election and what these charges actually say.
*  So even the Georgia indictment, which is much more ambitious and sweeping and considerably
*  less subtle, kind of concedes that the point is the illegal way he went about it.
*  The crime is not believing against all evidence that he won.
*  The crime is pursuing that belief through fraud and lies.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, there are two things that have kind of driven me crazy in the public conversation.
*  One is the argument, we don't have to prove intent because I'm thinking, can just read
*  the statutes.
*  Now, what intent you have to prove varies from statute to statute.
*  What do you have to show?
*  That's one that drives me crazy.
*  But another one is, well, oh gosh, if we have to prove intent, then how can you possibly
*  convict him?
*  But intent elements are extremely common in criminal charges and prosecutors prove intent
*  all the time.
*  This is not a magic get out of jail card to say, no, I didn't mean it.
*  Or I didn't mean to tell a lie, you have to acquit me.
*  Am I right in framing it like that or am I missing something?
*  You are.
*  A lot of what this reflects is this sort of public sensibility that Trump is so sort of
*  norm shattering and outside of normal political practices that the normal doesn't apply and
*  that he's just, there's also this perception that he's always skated and he's going to
*  skate again no matter what.
*  But I think we're starting to see that sort of just plotting methodical putting on your
*  case against him can work.
*  We saw that in E. Jean Carroll's defamation case.
*  We're seeing it in other instances.
*  And yes, all the time prosecutors prove beyond a reasonable doubt, intent when it's disputed.
*  The most common bread and butter federal charges of wire fraud and mail fraud require you to
*  fraudulent scheme that you intended to do a fraudulent scheme and where Trump is his
*  own worst enemy is his tendency to talk a lot and say things a lot, which are now being
*  brought to bear very effectively to help prove intent.
*  So when you're talking about how do you prove that someone intended to do something that
*  they had fraudulent intent, you do it the same way you decide whether your teenager
*  is lying to you.
*  Right.
*  And you analyze what they say to you.
*  And in the case of Trump, if you've got him saying something to Mike Pence, like the problem
*  is you're too honest, then that's exactly the sort of thing you lead with to say, see,
*  he knows that what he's doing is dishonest.
*  So there are some things in the past that we've talked about that people wanted him
*  to be prosecuted for, particularly during the Robert Mueller era, where the intent was
*  going to be hard to do.
*  These things, he's talked his way into a lot of the evidence against him.
*  Let's move on to Jack Smith.
*  It's a good logical next move.
*  How would you sort of in a nutshell describe the distinction?
*  What's different about the Jack Smith case versus the Fonny Willis case?
*  The Jack Smith case in DC is brought by an experienced federal prosecutor for federal
*  court, and it shows.
*  Federal court is very different than state court.
*  Much more formal, generally.
*  The judges can still get away with a remarkable amount, but not as much as they can in state
*  court.
*  Federal judges are tougher task masters.
*  To slightly overgeneralize, the court is more concerned with being rule-bound and with protecting
*  constitutional rights.
*  And it's probably the forum you'd often rather be in as a defendant.
*  I'd certainly rather be defending the DC case than the Georgia case.
*  So Smith seems to be both more concerned with the fact that he's in federal court and
*  he can't get away with as much, and he has to be more careful of these distinctions.
*  He also seems to be more explicitly concerned with the eyes of history being upon him and
*  that type of thing, with making something that is more overtly avoiding the appearance
*  of being deliberately political.
*  Even though, frankly, I think everyone who thinks it's political is going to, no matter
*  how you frame it, and everyone who thinks it's not is going to think that no matter
*  how you frame it.
*  So it's narrower, it's more specific, and there you've got this general conspiracy
*  to defraud the United States.
*  This is the plain vanilla conspiracy statute used all the time, but there's a clause in
*  there instead of just conspiring to violate a federal law, there's a clause for conspiring
*  to defraud the United States and to cheat the US.
*  And that's what he's going with here.
*  He's going with a conspiracy to obstruct an actual obstruction and a conspiracy against
*  civil rights.
*  Some of these people express surprise when Smith came out with them thinking this is
*  sort of, you know, very aggressive and forward in legal theory, and really historically it's
*  not.
*  There are arguments on all these for why the law is wrong, but the law for the last century
*  has fairly clearly shown that these are all theories that work, that you can defraud the
*  United States by interfering with one of its proceedings by deceit, that you can obstruct
*  an official proceeding by submitting fake things to it and things like that, and that
*  you can have a conspiracy against rights through election fraud by trying to fraudulently interfere
*  with accounting or processing of votes.
*  You can argue that all those cases are wrong, that they interpret the statutes the wrong
*  way, but I don't think you can seriously argue there isn't legal precedent for all these
*  theories.
*  Yeah, I think that's a very key distinction because the arguments that I've seen from
*  those who are defending Trump, if they're honest arguments, what they're saying is,
*  I acknowledge the precedent is against us, but the precedent is bad precedent.
*  And this current court would not, in fact, apply the law in the same way.
*  That seems to be the core of the argument.
*  The fact remains that as of this moment, the precedent does indicate that each one of these
*  charges is sort of solidly within historical practice.
*  You mentioned this whole thing about how we think the Supreme Court would go, being very
*  central to the theories of a lot of the critics of the DC indictment.
*  And certainly this is a conservative court.
*  It has overturned a lot of precedents.
*  I do not see this court as being super eager to help Donald Trump in these sorts of situations.
*  This court did not do the things that Trump partisans hoped it would in connection with
*  the 2020 election or any of the subsequent litigation.
*  And the kinds of theories people are sort of, I would call it wish casting, that the court
*  will step in and narrow some of this federal criminal law is not actually the way this
*  court is generally working.
*  They've stuck their neck out for some things that are Trump policy goals, but not so much
*  for Trump as a litigant.
*  I think that the faith that they're going to do that is misplaced.
*  Before we leave the January 6 cases, let's talk a little bit about this attempt to remove
*  some of these cases from state court to federal court.
*  You very helpfully outlined some of the differences in practice in federal court and why defendants
*  often like to be in federal court versus state court.
*  But let's walk through this removal argument in Georgia.
*  Sure.
*  Well, removal is bringing a case that was filed in state court into federal court.
*  And criminal removal, there's a statute and its origins are uncertain.
*  Even the cases that talk about it say, we're not entirely sure what the point of this is,
*  but it seems to be there wants to be some sort of bulwark to keep the state from interfering
*  with federal business through criminal prosecutions.
*  So there's a statute that says a federal official charged with a crime in state court can remove
*  it to federal court and they'll have a burden to keep it there of showing that they were
*  a federal official, that the things they're charged with are of or relating to the color
*  of their office to their official business and that they have a colorable, that is plausible,
*  federal defense, a defense under federal law.
*  And so Mark Meadows is the first one really to have his effort in this case assessed by
*  the federal judge who's looking at it.
*  And Judge Jones has kind of got something of a wide open field here.
*  A lot of these issues have not been thoroughly litigated.
*  And he asks sort of like almost like a philosophical question.
*  It's like, what is the heart of the Georgia case?
*  What is it that has to be related to your office?
*  And where he kind of comes out is the heart of the Georgia case is the allegation of a
*  RICO conspiracy and agreement to violate the law.
*  Particular pieces of evidence that aren't themselves crimes are not the heart of the
*  case.
*  And so therefore, even if one or two of those are things that arguably are related to Mark
*  Meadows' color of office, that doesn't make the whole thing related to his color of office.
*  He's not supposed to be doing political things.
*  That's not his function and so on.
*  This could go either way in front of the 11th Circuit.
*  It could even go either way in front of the United States Supreme Court.
*  You've got all these competing interests.
*  You've got these ideas of federalism or generally federal courts don't interfere with state
*  courts, particularly in criminal cases.
*  On the other hand, you've got the supremacy clause and the idea that the federal law reigns
*  supreme and then you throw all the politics on top of that.
*  And I have no idea where this is going to come out.
*  And one thing that I think is important to emphasize is even though if this case is successfully
*  removed, it's still going to be prosecuted under the Georgia state statutes and under
*  Georgia state precedent.
*  So all of the Georgia state laws that are at issue in the case are still going to be
*  the laws at issue in the case.
*  Now there are going to be differences in the rules of the federal court and there's going
*  to be differences in the jury pool that you draw in the federal court, but they're still
*  prosecuting these state criminal offenses in that federal court, even if it's removed.
*  They are unless the judge determines that there's a federal defense that precludes it.
*  So the precedent seems to suggest that if the judge determines that there's a federal
*  immunity issue and holds like a hearing and resolves the seated facts and that type of
*  thing, then that could be in effect dismissing the case.
*  But again, that's a heavy lift from Mark Meadows and the others here because it's hard to explain
*  why this stuff is actually related to their job and why it's necessary and proper.
*  Let's move on from January 6th to documents and I'll set it up like this.
*  It's really interesting to me if you've seen all of the back and forth of all of the various
*  legal experts weighing in on all of the aspects of this case, even though there's a lot of
*  disagreement, I've seen some general agreement that goes like this.
*  The Manhattan case involving the Stormy Daniels hush money payments is the weakest case.
*  A lot of fights over whether the Georgia case or the Jack Smith January 6th case is more
*  dangerous to Trump, where I kind of literally go back and forth on that in my own mind as
*  to which one is sort of the more dangerous case for Trump.
*  And then there's this consensus where you sort of bring up the documents case and they
*  go, oh yeah, that one's the strongest case.
*  And it's really hard to find somebody who would say anything other than that.
*  Where do you stand on this sort of consensus that the documents case sort of is in a class
*  by itself?
*  It is in a class by itself because it's a very different set of facts and because Donald
*  Trump in absolutely classic client form has absolutely sunk himself with his mouth by
*  repeatedly saying things that undermine any potential defense he has there, saying and
*  doing things.
*  He is the classic client who cannot keep his mouth shut, who keeps saying things that lock
*  him into stories, that preclude defenses, that admit things, stuff like that.
*  On the other hand, the countervailing factor is that it is in Florida with a different
*  jury pool where the hope of at least getting one juror to hang the jury seems to be much
*  more plausible.
*  And in Judge Eileen Cannon, he has a judge who has previously been willing to really
*  go out on a limb for him to a notable extent.
*  You know, one of someone he appointed, someone whose decisions in the case where she basically
*  shut down the investigation after the search warrant of Mar-a-Lago were very widely seen
*  as being without sound basis in law and, you know, draw from that what you will.
*  So those things protect him there.
*  But in terms of which case I think is like the simplest and strongest, the combo, that
*  probably is the documents case.
*  There is widespread consensus that his defenses, that he can, you know, declassify things with
*  his mind or that they're automatically declassified when he takes them, that those are nonsense.
*  They are not taken very seriously except by the most partisan commentators.
*  And the record of the things he said in front of other people, his braggadocio, his throwing
*  around of papers, that type of thing is just great intent evidence.
*  So I think that case is extremely dangerous to him.
*  And really what's standing between him and probable conviction in that one is a Florida
*  jury and Judge Eileen Cannon.
*  Let's talk about the judge for a minute.
*  You were very polite in your description of, I believe you said no sound basis, at the
*  risk of using another legal term of art.
*  I would say that her original decision that essentially halted the parts of the Mar-a-Lago
*  investigation was either Bonkers Town or in the suburbs of Bonkers Town.
*  It was so bad.
*  And in fact, it was sternly rebuked by the Court of Appeals.
*  Yeah, it was functionally lawless.
*  And the advocacy that led to it by Trump's attorneys was so terrible that it was that
*  much more notable.
*  The arguments were terrible.
*  And the way she accepted them and even did some other things they hadn't even asked for
*  were terrible.
*  And federal courts of appeal are not very emotive usually.
*  It's bad news when they are.
*  But you can read between the lines the tone of an opinion.
*  The opinion overturning her was fairly brutal in its explicitness.
*  So this is a judge who has basically gone way out on her own doing crazy things for
*  Trump.
*  You've practiced in front of a lot of different district judges.
*  I've practiced in front of a lot of different district judges and they'll have varying temperaments.
*  But one thing that I have seen is that if you're a district judge who's operating within
*  the broad norms of the profession, once a Court of Appeals has absolutely smacked one
*  of your rulings down and done so reading between the lines in a way that is almost screaming
*  in all caps.
*  In my experiences, so long as the district judge is still within those broad norms of
*  the legal profession, in some ways, they're going to be more careful because at this point
*  they're in almost a legacy moment here.
*  And so you saw recently Judge Cannon just basically granted the prosecution's protective
*  order motion in the case, appears to be adopting a more careful approach to this.
*  How much do you think that that really brutal Court of Appeals smackdown in the document
*  subpoena and the search litigation, realistically can we expect a more careful Judge Cannon as
*  a result of that judicial rebuke?
*  I think there's a number of factors that lead to a more careful Judge Cannon.
*  First of all, there's just experience.
*  She is, and you know, we can probably share this feeling preposterously young to be a
*  federal judge.
*  I think she's only 42.
*  And that's very young to wield that sort of power.
*  And a lot of the time when you see a judge, a person like that becoming a federal judge,
*  you see some sort of stumbling around at first.
*  When you see corporate lawyers or other lawyers whose practices, not so much trial practice,
*  becoming a federal judge, you see an acclamation period.
*  But often they become very good judges because they learn this stuff and they learn it as a judge
*  and they become very careful about it.
*  Also, there's a community of judges and lawyers that is different than the political community.
*  And so the experience of being a federal judge appears to be, broadly speaking,
*  sort of moderating.
*  It tends to move people towards that more professional consensus middle in terms of
*  things.
*  And part of that is your reputation and how the court of appeal treats you and that type
*  of thing.
*  But part of it is just the community that you're part of.
*  The judges you interact with, you go to for advice, that type of thing.
*  Also, judges are human.
*  And a lot of the time, like if a party leads a judge into error and they get smacked down,
*  judges will sort of tend to resent that party a little bit.
*  They will often start thinking, well, the last time I listened to you, the 11th Circuit
*  basically said in judicial terms I was being an idiot.
*  So why should I listen to you?
*  So I think all those factors will tend to move her towards the center.
*  That said, a lot of my commentary about cases and stuff is saying this thing you think is
*  extraordinary is not extraordinary.
*  This judge yelling at the prosecution is not in the tank for the defense.
*  That's just the way judges are.
*  This judge doing this is actually doing what judges all the time.
*  It's not such a big deal.
*  Calm down.
*  I can't really say that about Judge Cannon based on that earlier case.
*  That was remarkable, totally outside of norms to an extent that makes me very concerned
*  about the way she's going to approach the rest of the case.
*  And it would be difficult to overstate how easy it is for a federal judge to tank a case
*  if they want to.
*  Yeah, that's one thing I've tried to communicate to people about that initial Judge Cannon
*  ruling.
*  I was gobsmacked when I read it.
*  Right.
*  I mean, literally just absolutely gobsmacked.
*  And I'm also much like you, Ken.
*  I spend a lot of time saying, whoa, hold on, calm down.
*  Everything is not running out of control.
*  What you're watching is the system in process and this is what the system looks like.
*  We're within norms.
*  But that ruling was well outside of legal norms.
*  Now, she has not issued rulings since then that have been outside norms.
*  The trial date that she set seems pretty reasonable to me.
*  The protective order that she just outlined seems pretty reasonable to me.
*  So since then, she seems to have pulled in a bit.
*  But you're absolutely correct.
*  We shared the same view.
*  But let me do a little detour here because when you're talking about judicial norms,
*  the Trump team has filed a motion for the judge in the January 6th documents case to
*  recuse herself based on statements that she made in other January 6th cases.
*  And I know you've looked at this.
*  This is the federal January 6th case.
*  What are your thoughts on the Trump team's recusal motion and what the judge had said
*  in that case?
*  I don't think it will succeed or that it should.
*  And I think it illustrates the difference between what people think the rules for
*  recusal are and what they actually are.
*  Federal recusal is extremely narrow.
*  And in general, there are only two ways you get there.
*  One way is where the judge's comments are simply so historically extreme and out of bounds
*  that no one can possibly take them seriously as a neutral judge.
*  The other is if it's from an extrajudicial source, like the defendants are next door
*  neighbor and they hate them, that type of thing, from extrajudicial reasons.
*  Here, Judge Chutkin, in some of the January 6 cases where defendants were saying basically,
*  well, I was there because of Trump, made comments to the effect of, well, the person who inspired
*  you to do this stuff isn't in jail.
*  Maybe you should be.
*  So you can certainly see why that seems to show some prejudging of Donald Trump.
*  And you could imagine a system where you argue that makes her ineligible because she's
*  expressed that.
*  But it's not extrajudicial.
*  So she's come to that conclusion based on the evidence before her in court in related
*  cases.
*  And that generally is not a basis for recusal.
*  That's why a judge can hear a bunch of related cases without having to recuse themselves.
*  The thing is, recusal is a doctrine largely developed by judges and administered by judges.
*  And they understand each other.
*  And judges, how can I put this?
*  They run their mouth a lot.
*  Okay.
*  And you can't always consume what they say on an explicit or literal, any more than you
*  can with Trump.
*  Federal judges emote as much as one's the proverbial uncle at Thanksgiving.
*  And judges understand that.
*  And so they don't take each other any more seriously with that type of rhetoric.
*  They don't see it as extreme.
*  They see it as just sort of, you know, you got a black robe, you're sitting up there,
*  everyone's listening to you.
*  You're going to say what's on your mind.
*  And that's the way it comes out.
*  Yeah.
*  It is a unique experience.
*  And lawyers who are listening to this will relate to the experience on being on the receiving end
*  of a judge who is venting.
*  And it's really unlike almost any other venting experience that you'll ever endure because
*  you really are limited in your ability as a practical matter to vent back.
*  But you know what?
*  Once you understand that's just kind of the way they are, you get used to it.
*  Not such a big deal anymore.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  All right.
*  Well, let's end this with a discussion of the first indictment brought against Trump.
*  And that's the Bragg state indictment, state court indictment related to the Stormy Daniels
*  hush money payments.
*  And again, it is really remarkable with all of the various competing legal arguments in
*  a hyper polarized nation.
*  There is an absolute consensus that this is the weakest of the cases.
*  And rightly so.
*  Right.
*  And why is that?
*  So, I mean, there are a lot of sort of rarely enforced, scarily flexible laws out there
*  that are rarely charged, but could be if a prosecutor just has it in for you and wants
*  to find some way to do it.
*  And this falsifying business records charge in New York seems to be such a thing.
*  And the case is characterized by the way they went about it.
*  They did these tons and tons of counts just gratuitously.
*  The what is it?
*  34 counts of falsifying business records for the concept that false notations were made
*  in various types of check ledgers and things like that, indicating that money going to
*  Michael Cohen was for legal services as opposed to a way to reimburse hush money to an adult
*  actress.
*  And in addition to kind of being and you can believe this if it's inappropriate, widely
*  considered to be chicken shit, which it kind of is, it's, you know, a petty thing that
*  they've made into a huge thing and put 34 counts of.
*  I think it's extraordinarily hard to prove Trump's individual understanding or knowledge
*  of it.
*  Trump does not strike me as a generally accepted accounting principles guy.
*  The thought that he personally directed or was involved in personally directing the way
*  payments would be classified and did so with fraudulent intent seems like a much bigger
*  lift than saying that, you know, he lied to the Georgia attorney general or something like
*  that, secretary of state or something like that.
*  It's complicated.
*  It's nitpicky.
*  It's not the sort of thing you would really see him getting his hands dirty with.
*  It's not the sort of thing you would even necessarily see him as understanding very
*  well.
*  So I think that it's a flailing around trying to find a theory in which they could go after
*  him because they're so mad at him.
*  They put so many resources and trying to get him.
*  So they find this, okay, well, he treated this hush money as something that actually
*  wasn't.
*  And, you know, let's say that.
*  So kind of comes off as desperate to me, certainly when it seemed at the time as if it might
*  be the only criminal consequences of his long pattern of illegal behavior.
*  It was very disappointing.
*  Now I think it's kind of more embarrassing when you compare it to the other cases.
*  Yeah, you know, and just to sort of like nail down the specifics, it really depends on a
*  two step process because there's the step one, which is did he falsify business records,
*  which there's a pretty strong case that business records and I'm going to use sort of passive
*  voice here were falsified, but that's a misdemeanor.
*  Right.
*  And not only is it just a misdemeanor, it's also a misdemeanor that's probably time barred.
*  It's probably we're probably past the statute of limitations.
*  So to make this the more serious case, you have to show that these business records were
*  falsified and further into the commission of another crime.
*  Right.
*  And so you have to show that there's another crime in play here.
*  And that isn't really specified with that much clarity, at least in the initial charging
*  documents.
*  And that's where they're just going to have a problem, a proof problem in that case regarding
*  this other extra step that is the one that A, turns it from a misdemeanor into felony and B,
*  at least stabs at dealing with some of the statutes of limitations issues.
*  Well, the statute of limitations, as I understand it, David, that their theory is that basically
*  there's a New York statute where if you're out of state consistently for a period of time,
*  the statute's told.
*  And so he was in Washington and Mar-a-Lago and I think that's their theory.
*  So from what I've heard, generally that's not considered to be as better defense.
*  But yeah, I agree with you that the extra step of making it into a felony by having
*  to connect it to some other crime is a problem.
*  Apparently they're thinking maybe it's campaign finance fraud, which has even more
*  exacting intent standards.
*  Often you have to know you're violating the law there.
*  Good luck proving that.
*  Or it might be under this weird New York statute about corrupting an election or whatever it is.
*  Those are big lists.
*  But I just, to the very basic idea, I think it's very hard to show that he is personally
*  directing how this is going to be treated or that he cares.
*  Maybe they have Michael Cohen testifying.
*  He's going to be a terrible witness.
*  His rehabilitation tour notwithstanding.
*  Maybe they've got some of the accountants putting Trump in there.
*  But yeah, I mean, again, you've got a New York jury, so maybe they're more adverse to Trump.
*  You've got state court more loosey goosey with the rules.
*  But still, it's no question it's the weakest.
*  Okay.
*  We've talked about all of these cases.
*  We have at least three trial dates right now dating before the election.
*  And so let's just wind up with a brief discussion of the trial dates.
*  How many of these trial dates do you think will stick?
*  In your experience, when you see an initial trial date set, like we have seen in some of these cases,
*  how often do these initial trial dates stick?
*  Is it actually the case that we'll have multiple criminal cases of Donald Trump in the height of
*  the campaign?
*  Just transparently and where I'm coming from this, I have been dubious that we will have all of these
*  things unfold in 2024.
*  I am also dubious they will all unfold.
*  Right.
*  I think given the way the judge's attitude, there's an excellent chance that at least one will.
*  So Judge Chutkin in DC and Judge Cannon in Florida have announced trial dates that are,
*  in my view, pretty aggressive, much more aggressive than I would expect for white collar cases
*  of this complexity.
*  So it is very routine for white collar criminal cases to take a very long time to go to trial.
*  And the excuse is usually, but Your Honor, there's millions of documents and so forth.
*  But these are complex cases with tons of witnesses and players.
*  So the relatively early in 2024 dates we've gotten in those two federal cases are aggressive.
*  And I think suggest that those judges are not going to let them delay forever.
*  Some federal judges are big believers in what's called the rocket docket.
*  I got to keep my docket moving.
*  So I don't care what you need or what you want.
*  You're going to trial.
*  And that's often used basically to coerce people into settle civil cases or plead guilty
*  criminal cases.
*  But that suggests to me that the federal cases are more likely to move forward.
*  I'd say particularly the DC one given Judge Chutkin's attitude there.
*  But in Georgia, it may be these get split up into a bunch of different little cases.
*  I think some of the ones related to Trump are going to go to trial before the election.
*  I'm not sure if Trump's himself will.
*  And that's going to we're going to see once the judge starts ruling on his own motions,
*  as opposed to his co-defendants motions, where that's likely to go.
*  But I think it is strongly likely that at least one of these criminal cases is going to go to trial
*  before the election, maybe two or three.
*  It's also possible that all four are booted until after the election, which would present in a very
*  stark way.
*  This idea that part of what's at issue in the election is ultimately whether he is a practical
*  matter gets tried at all, at least in the next term, as the head of the executive branch,
*  which includes the DOJ.
*  If he wins, he could direct the DOJ to drop all the cases against him.
*  Just wipe these away.
*  Or he could pardon himself, which I suspect would be his move.
*  There's controversy over whether that's legal, but it's almost certainly a political dispute
*  that's not justiciable by the courts.
*  So yeah, that's very stark.
*  He can't, of course, pardon himself on the state claims, but he could get rid of the federal ones.
*  I think the federal ones are probably the two most dangerous cases for him.
*  All right, Ken.
*  At the ending of the Every Ezra Klein Show, there are three book recommendations that we ask our
*  guests to make.
*  What three books are you recommending to listeners today?
*  I'm recommending three very different books.
*  One is Pax, P-A-X, by Tom Holland, not Spider-Man, the British popular historian,
*  writing about the peak of the Roman Empire.
*  And he's got a fantastic narrative voice, and he's one of those historians who really has a way to
*  make his enthusiasm for the subject matter and the period jump off the page.
*  The next one is Shadow Docket by Professor Steve Vladeck.
*  I'm sure you've read this one, David, and this is the one about how the Supreme Court's motion docket,
*  how ruling on special emergency motions, the difference it can make in the law in ways that
*  are not immediately apparent to us.
*  And sort of these big changes that are made kind of behind the scenes in a way that are not
*  consumed the same way as opinions and cases.
*  And then finally, the third, one of my favorite authors, James Elroy, one of the most pessimistic
*  and darkest authors about America and what it's like.
*  His newest book is The Enchanters.
*  He's got this infectiously pessimistic, down on everything voice.
*  He's to dragnet and the notion of cops the way Game of Thrones is to J.R.R. Tolkien.
*  He's sort of like the seedy side of it all exposed.
*  He uses language in a really interesting way, and I can't resist him.
*  Thank you so much for joining the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Thanks for sharing your expertise, and especially from my standpoint, it's great to see you
*  and it's great to chat with you.
*  So thanks for joining me.
*  It's good to see you again, too, David.
*  It's like the fall of 1991 all over again and first learning some of this stuff.
*  All over again.
*  Oh, those glorious days when we had hair on our heads.
*  Exactly.
*  Thank you, Kim.
*  Thank you.
