Video Description: Right after the election, I talked about how the results reminded me of 2004. George W. Bush won re-election that year — and unlike four years earlier, the popular vote, too. Democrats were truly, undeniably in the wilderness. But two years later, they found their way out. Democrats won the House for the first time in 12 years. And two years after that, with the election of Barack Obama, they completed their trifecta. Does that comeback story have any lessons for Democrats today?


Rahm Emanuel is the person to ask. He helped orchestrate that 2006 Democratic victory as the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. He was Obama’s first chief of staff. And before that, Emanuel was a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton. Emanuel has been a central player in most of the biggest Democratic victories of the past few decades. And people like David Axelrod and Steve Israel have been floating his name to lead the Democratic National Committee to help guide Democrats out of the wilderness once more. But Emanuel is also a controversial figure in the party. And the eras of Democratic politics he represents have complicated legacies and aren’t remembered with unanimous warmth.


In this conversation, Emanuel argues that Democrats have fallen out of touch with what Americans actually want. We discuss why Democrats lost this November, what lessons they’ve forgotten from the Obama and Clinton years and how he would plot a Democratic comeback today.

# It's the Corruption, Stupid
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=0.0s)]
*  So our last episode was with Fajd Shakir, Bernie Sanders' former campaign manager. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=30.88s)]
*  And it was about the question of whether Bernieism was a way forward for the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=36.0s)]
*  Democratic Party. But I said at the beginning I was gonna make that a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=40.64s)]
*  pairing, that we're gonna have two very different perspectives on what Democrats [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=44.24s)]
*  should do next. So here is the other, and it is, as I promised, very different. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=48.56s)]
*  Rahm Emanuel is America's ambassador to Japan. Before that he was mayor of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=53.92s)]
*  Chicago. But it's what he did before that that interests me. Emanuel is Barack [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=59.48s)]
*  Obama's chief of staff in the first two years of Obama's first term. This was [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  when Obama passed the stimulus bill, the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=69.0s)]
*  financial reforms. It's fair to say that we could not have accomplished what we've [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=73.88s)]
*  accomplished without Rahm's leadership. You never want a serious crisis to go to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=78.88s)]
*  waste. And what I mean by that, it's an opportunity to do things that you think [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  you could not do before. And before that, Emanuel led the Democratic Congressional [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=87.8s)]
*  Campaign Committee in 2006. This was the midterm election following George W. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=92.76s)]
*  Bush's reelection in 2004. And Emanuel masterminded the campaign that won the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=98.4s)]
*  House back for Democrats for the first time in 12 years. Americans voted for a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=104.56s)]
*  change in the last election and today we got it. The new 110th Congress convened [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=109.44s)]
*  with the Democrats in charge of both houses for the first time in 12 years and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=114.8s)]
*  for the first time ever a woman is Speaker of the House. From every corner [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=119.28s)]
*  of the country, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=124.16s)]
*  the American people [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  have sent [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=129.76s)]
*  a resounding and unmistakable message of change and new direction for America. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=131.96s)]
*  And before that, Emanuel is one of Bill Clinton's top advisors and top [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=138.72s)]
*  fundraisers. There's an old saying that if you want to make an omelet, you have [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=145.36s)]
*  to break a few eggs. The American people were hungry for leadership and I'm proud [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=149.0s)]
*  that in providing that leadership, President Clinton broke a few eggs. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=153.84s)]
*  Here's what you cannot take away from him. He has been at the center of most [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=157.76s)]
*  of the biggest Democratic victories, both electoral and legislative, since in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=162.36s)]
*  the 90s. The people who love him in the party, and there are many, they say, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=166.32s)]
*  what this guy knows is how to win. And having lost in 2024, Democrats want to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=172.36s)]
*  win. And so Emanuel's name is popping up a lot. David Axelrod, Obama's former [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=177.96s)]
*  chief strategist, said that Emanuel should be the next DNC chair. Steve [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=182.64s)]
*  Israel, a former top House Democrat, he said the same. Emanuel and his allies [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=186.96s)]
*  are clearly pushing him back into the frame. There's a campaign going on right [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=192.04s)]
*  now. But there is a lot of detractors too. Emanuel is a very controversial [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=196.08s)]
*  figure in the party. There are large factions that see the Clinton and Obama [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=202.52s)]
*  eras as good for Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, but not that good for Democrats [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  down ballot. And Emanuel is not from the wing of the party that believes the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  American public is waiting for democratic socialism. He's from the wing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=216.28s)]
*  of the party that believes Democrats are often out of touch, that they listen to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=219.96s)]
*  what gets said in the faculty lounge and dismiss what gets said on the street [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=224.28s)]
*  corner, that the most important thing Democrats have to do in any election, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=228.36s)]
*  particularly congressional election, is demonstrate through the candidates they [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=233.08s)]
*  run, the things they say, and the things they choose not to say, that they're [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=237.52s)]
*  listening to the people they claim to represent. I've said before that I think [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=243.2s)]
*  the analog to be thinking about after 2024 is 2004. The last time a Republican [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=248.8s)]
*  president who won his first term by losing the popular vote got reelected in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  much more convincing fashion. And Rahm Emanuel was a guy after that 2004 [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=261.08000000000004s)]
*  drubbing who led the Democratic comeback in 2006. So I want to have him on the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=265.92s)]
*  show. What did he learn in that campaign? And what does he think Democrats should [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=270.76s)]
*  do now? As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at ny times.com. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=275.04s)]
*  Rahm Emanuel, welcome to the show. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=293.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  So let's just start here. Why do you think the Democrats lost in 2024? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, look, at a certain level, when 70% of the country thinks the economy is [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=301.24s)]
*  bad, and by equal measure, 70% think the country's headed in the wrong direction, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  that is a structural equation for an anti-incumbent election. Then there's, I [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=314.72s)]
*  think, a second part which takes understanding. And that is, the top of the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=321.44s)]
*  ticket performs worse than the congressional wing, which is not the norm. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=327.48s)]
*  And then there's kind of this moment in time. And you can look at other places [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=334.32s)]
*  where you and I are sitting here when a right winger just went to the top in the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=339.32s)]
*  Romanian election. People call it populism. I actually call it an [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  anti-establishment. And then I dial my clock all the way back, Ezra. Look, I [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=346.6s)]
*  think there's two seminal moments that explain the last 20 plus years in [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=352.96s)]
*  American politics. One, the Iraq War, where the American people were deceived [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=357.76s)]
*  into a war of choice. We lost thousands of young men and women. Thousands of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=363.84s)]
*  young men and women are maimed for life. And we spent a trillion dollars in a [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  failed endeavor, in a war of choice, and we're lied to. And nobody, and I mean [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=374.64s)]
*  nobody, ever held accountable. Six years later, the financial industry, housing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=379.36s)]
*  crash, near depression, people lose not their lives like in the Iraq War, but [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=385.6s)]
*  they lose their livelihood, their homes. So you have people losing lives, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=390.12s)]
*  livelihood, and the elite and the top of the society, totally unaccountable, and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=393.76s)]
*  never act like they did anything wrong. People out of the foreign policy [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=399.76s)]
*  establishment, they're on boards, institutions, universities, bankers [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=403.68s)]
*  yelling for their bonuses, and the American people are fed up. And then you [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=408.72s)]
*  fast forward through COVID. And I think that what happens is the Democrats go in [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=413.76000000000005s)]
*  the prior years, President Obama, the 06 election, etc., from anti-establishment [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  to the establishment and the elite with the whole, the way we dealt with COVID, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=424.44000000000005s)]
*  the way we dealt with science and talked to people. And I think that is a deeper [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=429.48s)]
*  current. It's unique to the United States, the first two examples, not totally [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=433.56s)]
*  the financial. And to me, that explains a lot of what I call the anti-Brussels, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=438.0s)]
*  anti-Washington DC. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=443.56s)]
*  You say no one was ever held accountable, but that's passive voice. You all never [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=446.0s)]
*  held anyone accountable. The administration that comes after the Iraq War [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=450.47999999999996s)]
*  and the financial crisis is the Obama administration. You're the first chief [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  of staff. Who was going to do it if not you? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=458.08s)]
*  That's what I was going to tell you. There's a famous, in about March, after [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=460.76s)]
*  the stimulus, a very fair question, because we were having this debate after [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=465.68s)]
*  we passed Children's Health Insurance, Lilly Ledbetter legislation and the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  stimulus bill and a number of other things on national service and protecting [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=475.2s)]
*  kids on tobacco. We have this big Saturday debate. President Obama had three [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=479.64s)]
*  major initiatives, cap and trade, health care reform and financial reform. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=484.64s)]
*  And this is generic at 10,000 feet. Everybody, there's nuances. We have a [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=489.72s)]
*  massive debate. The domestic side of it said that you got to start on health [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=497.92s)]
*  care right now. It has to be first because every day you lose on health care [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=501.6s)]
*  to do it, you're not going to get there. Not wrong about the legislative [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=505.88s)]
*  politics. The economic team worried that if you push financial reform first, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=509.88s)]
*  the banks won't lend and it will hold the economy back. I was arguing for Old [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=516.1999999999999s)]
*  Testament justice. It's been written about just taking a banker in the middle [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=520.7199999999999s)]
*  of the public square and literally beating the hell out of them through [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=525.52s)]
*  financial reform. Because this system, the society, needed not only the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=530.36s)]
*  catharsis, but we needed not only legislatively the reforms, but I think the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=535.64s)]
*  whole system needed somebody to be held accountable. And my argument about [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=540.28s)]
*  financial reform was the bankers would be on the other side fighting you, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=544.76s)]
*  the financial industry. In health care, to get it done, and there's a memo to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=547.48s)]
*  this effect, is you're going to need the health care industry, the lessons out [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=552.96s)]
*  of the Clinton administration, on your side of the table. The interest groups [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=556.04s)]
*  had to be brought over or neutralized. And that was a big debate. President [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=559.92s)]
*  Obama, you weigh kind of using the clock for health care or the fear about the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=566.2s)]
*  economy and you have to weigh these equities and never 100%. And you're right. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=571.76s)]
*  And not a banker and not a foreign policy establishment person and that kind of [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=575.48s)]
*  populism we talk about, I refer to as anti-establishment and anti-elite. And [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=582.12s)]
*  then the Democrats in 06, 08 win and because none of the type of candidates, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=587.8s)]
*  equality candidates, but also because we were against what the establishment had [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=593.6s)]
*  done. I think we don't realize how COVID flipped the script and we become the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=597.96s)]
*  establishment, we become the elite and there's a series of other things that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=603.44s)]
*  are additive to it. And you're not wrong to raise that question. I think there's a [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  political price to pay that literally, you know, when we were doing financial [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=611.48s)]
*  reform after health care, bankers are yelling about their bonuses, they [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=616.24s)]
*  deserve bonus, Washington shouldn't tell them. And we're bailing the industry out [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=620.6800000000001s)]
*  to the tune of $800 billion. And in those days, that was a big number. So you're not [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=624.68s)]
*  wrong on that level. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=629.6s)]
*  Can you really channel anti-elite or anti-establishment sentiment through the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  people of the establishment? And look, I'm talking to you, you're a former White [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  Office Chief of Staff, you're the ambassador to Japan, you've worked in [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=643.0799999999999s)]
*  finance, you've worked for presidents, you have led the DCCC. There can be a [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=647.64s)]
*  tendency to say that there's an anti-establishment mood and everyone [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=652.92s)]
*  needs to pick that up. But does that mean a personnel changeover? Like your [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=657.52s)]
*  brother is a major health advisor and was a significant voice, Eka Manuel, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=663.5999999999999s)]
*  during the pandemic. Your other brother runs WME. When we talk about an [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=667.88s)]
*  anti-establishment mood, is it something that then requires a new generation of [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=673.5999999999999s)]
*  figures to channel that? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=678.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, that's kind of a self-interested question from here. So yes and no. In the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=681.24s)]
*  short answer, I mean, you look at Donald Trump and he's captured, I would not [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=685.52s)]
*  call the president-elect by any imagination as to what it is has to be an [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=689.4s)]
*  authentic voice of populism. Yet he has sold himself as that person. And he does [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=694.9599999999999s)]
*  it, not just on an economic basis, I will be your instrument of your revenge. And [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=700.04s)]
*  he's not, it just has to be authentic. He's not exactly character A that you [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=705.12s)]
*  would point to. And I can give you the characters, or individuals rather, not [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=710.32s)]
*  characters, in Europe, etc. that also don't quote unquote fit that mold that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=714.2s)]
*  you're talking about and yet still have a voice that people attach to. That may [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=720.08s)]
*  tell you the depth of their anger, that they'll look past a lot of contradictions [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=724.2800000000001s)]
*  to get there. Fair question, but then I go back to what when I was DCCC chair, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=728.24s)]
*  Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair in 2006. I can't tell you [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=734.4000000000001s)]
*  how many times I got told by members of the caucus, the people you're recruiting [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=739.08s)]
*  at that time, these were veterans of the Iraq-Afghanistan war, members of the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=743.4000000000001s)]
*  Intelligence Committee, National Security apparatus, sheriffs, football players, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=747.4000000000001s)]
*  different people, small business owners. And they said, well, these aren't real [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=750.9200000000001s)]
*  Democrats. I said, well, they actually reflect as every election does, but the [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=755.0400000000001s)]
*  election has a story and narrative behind it. They reflect this moment in [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=761.2800000000001s)]
*  time, and they are real Democrats. They may not come out of your mold, but they [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=765.72s)]
*  reflect the reality of their congressional district, which I think tells [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=769.88s)]
*  that story. So part of the biography has to be authentic, but it's not a hundred [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=775.04s)]
*  percent an explanation for electoral or policy success. It's a core piece, no doubt. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=781.8s)]
*  And I think the feeling has to be authentic. And we're talking for two reasons, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=789.04s)]
*  but one reason is one night a few weeks ago, I'm sitting in my chair reading and [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=793.24s)]
*  I get a call from a number I don't recognize, and I pick it up and it's you. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=799.52s)]
*  And with a lot of fury, you start telling me that you just feel Democrats have [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=804.12s)]
*  lost weight. But one thing you said that you can say what you want to say from the [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=810.68s)]
*  conversation, but one thing you said that has been in my mind is that there were [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=814.36s)]
*  lessons in the Bill Clinton era, lessons in the Barack Obama era that you feel the [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=818.4399999999999s)]
*  Democratic Party has tossed aside. That there's, on the one hand, I think you're [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=824.4399999999999s)]
*  right, an anti-establishment mood that the Democrats in the Biden and the [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=828.48s)]
*  Harris era did not channel and could not even speak to. But on the other hand, one [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=832.8s)]
*  of the things you have been saying publicly and I think privately is that [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=837.68s)]
*  there has also been a throwing overboard of what you see as both institutional and [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=842.7199999999999s)]
*  political wisdom that I think you understand yourself as a vessel for helping [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=849.7199999999999s)]
*  the Democratic Party put back in front. So tell me what that wisdom is. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=853.92s)]
*  Well, let me get one thing off. This is like therapy, so let me get one thing off. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=858.04s)]
*  That's podcasts. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=861.88s)]
*  Do you take Blue Cross Blue Shield? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=864.28s)]
*  No therapist does. That's the problem. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=866.16s)]
*  Democrats, I mean, think about it. The harshest criticism of President Clinton [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=867.84s)]
*  and President Obama's tenure come from Democrats. Fact. Bill Clinton, first [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=873.52s)]
*  Democrat to get reelected since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. That's a fact. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=879.2800000000001s)]
*  Second, from 1968 to 1988, 20 year run outside of Jimmy Carter, the Republicans [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=883.8000000000001s)]
*  run the presidency and they run on law and order under Richard Nixon, welfare [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=890.64s)]
*  queens under Ronald Reagan and Willie Horton under George Herbert Walker Bush. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=894.28s)]
*  Bill Clinton from Arkansas comes along and sows the riddle of these holes, what [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=898.9599999999999s)]
*  we would call cultures, but crime, drugs, immigration and welfare. Now we can go [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=906.9599999999999s)]
*  through the policies, argue certain things, but he not only gets reelected, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=912.4s)]
*  which is one measure of success, but he also sets in a period of time. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=916.52s)]
*  I think it's six out of the last seven presidential elections, Democrats win [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=921.28s)]
*  the majority of votes. I'm not saying he's totally responsible for it, but it [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=924.88s)]
*  sets a pattern. And rather than learn the lesson of how we solved a 20 year [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=928.72s)]
*  problem for the party that had weighed on Michael Tkakas, weighed on every [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=935.4s)]
*  other candidate prior to that, we totally shun his presidency aside. The people [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=939.76s)]
*  that study it are the Republicans. They learn from it. Now the same thing, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=945.48s)]
*  President Obama, through both talking about his community service in working [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=951.9200000000001s)]
*  with skill workers and communities, how he then addressed the saving both [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=958.52s)]
*  Chrysler and GM and the auto industry and not just the industry and the jobs, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=962.48s)]
*  but the communities that relied on that single plant in, you know, a Youngstown, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=966.96s)]
*  Ohio, or in a Rockford, Illinois, or in a Saginaw or Flint, Michigan, and he [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=972.28s)]
*  could relate to it. And we say, Oh, well, that that economic recovery was just so [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=978.88s)]
*  low and small. It wasn't big. It wasn't both. One Ohio got reelected, passed [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=986.04s)]
*  major health care. You don't do 100%. And we look at this and then you can take [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=993.1999999999999s)]
*  this election and we're not only losing working class whites, we're losing [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1000.0s)]
*  working class blacks and Hispanics. And it is under a tenure of a president who [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1004.68s)]
*  clearly most pro labor president since either John Kennedy or Harry S. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1009.84s)]
*  Truman. And I've said this to you privately, I've said it publicly, there [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1016.56s)]
*  is more to people than the collection of their wallet and their checkbook. They [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1021.36s)]
*  care about where their kids go to school. They care about whether their [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1028.28s)]
*  wives, spouses or partners or children can drive a car without being car [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1033.24s)]
*  checked and yelling at people. Well, crime is coming down doesn't work. Let [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1037.72s)]
*  me tell you something, no, I mean, as a former mayor, nobody walks around going, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1043.04s)]
*  you know what, I feel 22% safer in 2024 than I did in 2023. Crime is a feeling, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1045.96s)]
*  a sense of a place of mind. And rather than telling people you don't see the [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1051.68s)]
*  data, which is how we come off, we should be saying here's our agenda to [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1056.64s)]
*  ensure that we keep reducing crime. And here's what we're going to do next. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1061.5200000000002s)]
*  We're going to work on carjacking, car thefts, which is actually what is going [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1065.68s)]
*  up not coming down. Now think about this. Pre COVID is another example of an [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1070.44s)]
*  issue and where I think our party goes wrong. Pre COVID Democrats historically [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1076.76s)]
*  run somewhere between a 15 to 22 point advantage on education. From COVID [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1083.92s)]
*  forward, the only two things you hear from Democrats on education is we're [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1089.3999999999999s)]
*  going to shut the school down. We're going to close the front door of the [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1094.2s)]
*  school. And after COVID, we're going to blow open the bathroom school door. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1098.76s)]
*  That's it. Not what you're going to do on math, not what you're going to do on [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1104.44s)]
*  reading, what you're going to do to drive graduation. And now what is the net [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1107.48s)]
*  result? Not only are parents pulling kids out of public schools, we're barely [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1110.8s)]
*  breaking even on the issue of education. And a president is running for election [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1115.84s)]
*  saying I'm going to shut down the Department of Education and we don't have [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1119.76s)]
*  a credible voice or a credible box to stand on. We took a singular issue that [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1122.0s)]
*  we were the voice on and Republicans were 20 points behind us on on average. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1126.72s)]
*  And we've lost it all. And we don't even look at why is it. We were very strong [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1133.76s)]
*  pro labor as a party. Joe Biden gets credit for that. We lost working class [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1140.72s)]
*  votes. And these are parents. They live in a community. They send their kids to [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1145.3600000000001s)]
*  school. They send their kids to a park facility, a library. They're driving in [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1153.92s)]
*  their community. We don't actually in the name of fighting for working class, we [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1159.3600000000001s)]
*  don't actually hear them. We don't listen to them. We know we tell them how to eat [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1163.84s)]
*  their peas. It's hard for me to hear you say that. And I think these are also [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1167.2s)]
*  lessons from your mayorship, which is not really where I want to focus on in this [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1171.6000000000001s)]
*  conversation. But a lot of the angriest criticism of you was around shutting [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1176.0800000000002s)]
*  down schools and what those schools meant to communities. Did that change your [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1180.32s)]
*  sense of what it means when a school is not functioning? What a school means in a [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1184.32s)]
*  place? I mean, there's no look, it was an angry part. I mean, I talk about it. And [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1188.72s)]
*  we did things like drive our graduation rate up. But that was the hardest, one of [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1194.6399999999999s)]
*  the hardest decisions I made as a mayor. You had schools that were built for 800 [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1199.6799999999998s)]
*  with 200 or less kids. And it was incredibly hard because it was not just a [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1205.12s)]
*  school, it was an anchor in a community. Not only couldn't you afford it, but the [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1212.0s)]
*  kids, the schools were three, four, five, six, seven years in a row, failing. And [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1215.6s)]
*  the school meant something emotionally, physically, and I get it. Very tough. But [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1221.6s)]
*  I think what's tougher, letting a kid, because it was politically hard, stay in [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1227.12s)]
*  a failing school. In the end of the day, eight years later, while other mayors [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1230.8799999999999s)]
*  have opposed what I did, they haven't opened up the schools. One of the measures [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1236.48s)]
*  of success you mentioned with both Clinton and Obama, and I think correctly, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1241.6799999999998s)]
*  is re-election. Let me say one thing. I don't mean to interrupt you, sir. I made [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1245.1999999999998s)]
*  that decision in my first term and got re-elected. I'm not saying it was easy, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1250.32s)]
*  but there is a measure there both on the academic side and the political side. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1254.48s)]
*  Well, that actually sets up what I'm going to ask, which is one of the measures [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1257.92s)]
*  you've mentioned here is re-election, right, for Clinton, for Obama. And one [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1261.52s)]
*  critique you hear of both of them is that, yes, they got re-elected, but under [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1266.08s)]
*  them, the Democratic Party downed ballot got annihilated. So under Clinton, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1271.04s)]
*  Democrats lose the House for the first time in 40 years. Under Barack Obama, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1276.56s)]
*  huge wipeouts in 2010, very, very rough election in 2014. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1281.44s)]
*  has made a version of this argument against you that, yes, what they were able to do was [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1288.6399999999999s)]
*  successfully manage their own political capital, but they were not able to build a [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1294.1599999999999s)]
*  strong and healthy Democratic Party. And one of the reasons the Democratic Party [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1299.12s)]
*  subsequently turned on their brands of politics, more so on Clinton than Obama, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1302.4s)]
*  in my view, obviously Joe Biden was Obama's vice president, is that the party felt that [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1306.5600000000002s)]
*  what they did worked for them, but not for the future of the Democratic Party. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1312.5600000000002s)]
*  There's a legitimacy to her observation and a conclusion. I don't think it explains [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1315.92s)]
*  everything, and I don't think it's 100% accurate, but it's a valid critique. One, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1322.3200000000002s)]
*  you already start under Ronald Reagan seeing what are we called Reagan Democrats, that movement. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1330.0s)]
*  And the South, which had been a bastion for Democrats that we remembered, was shifting [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1336.96s)]
*  earlier than President Clinton, but it was a wipeout and it doesn't explain everything. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1342.32s)]
*  I had disagreements with Bill Clinton. He thinks it was the assault weapon ban. I don't think it [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1347.36s)]
*  was passing the assault weapon ban that caused the loss. President Clinton and I, having been [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1352.4s)]
*  responsible for seeing that legislation through, had a 20-year run in debate on whether the assault [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1359.92s)]
*  weapon ban was responsible for 94. And he does get reelected and Democrats do make gains. And [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1366.4s)]
*  by the way, in 1998, he breaks a 100-year kind of norm, which is in the sixth year of presidency, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1374.4s)]
*  a presidency just gets blown out. Actually, the Democrats pick up House seats. So her critique is [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1381.04s)]
*  not wrong, but it's not 100% accurate to what happened. It's more kind of devastating what [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1388.48s)]
*  happens from Democrats and when President Obama is done. I think we have the lowest House and [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1394.88s)]
*  legislative seats in about 100 years. I do think American politics is fundamentally different. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1401.68s)]
*  This is my view, other people can argue, after the war and the financial meltdown. And it's never [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1410.72s)]
*  getting above. You can't get a president today above 60%. You can't get, you know, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1417.28s)]
*  right track, wrong track has been politicized, economic sense, right track, right track in the [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1423.28s)]
*  sense of the direction of the country. Economic sentiment about whether the economy is healthy [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1427.84s)]
*  or not healthy has been politicized. And the legitimacy and delegitimacy of Washington is in [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1432.1599999999999s)]
*  a place that's different than it was pre-2000. Now to the effect on the party, a lot of efforts [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1439.76s)]
*  under President Obama are to build outside the party, not inside the party infrastructure. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1448.96s)]
*  And that has its own consequence as well. And so it's a critique. And as I've already said, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1455.12s)]
*  it's somewhat accurate, but somewhat inaccurate. Because I do think as you start from Bill Clinton's [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1462.56s)]
*  election forward, did create on a national level, a favorable environment for Democrats, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1467.68s)]
*  because he finally took what we call this bag of issues, this cultural set of issues, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1473.3600000000001s)]
*  and took them off the Democratic back and allowed us to get hurt on a whole host of economic issues [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1479.3600000000001s)]
*  that we hadn't been heard on before. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1486.5600000000002s)]
*  So [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1497.68s)]
*  this then gets to the other reason I wanted to have you on the show, which is after 12 years, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1520.0800000000002s)]
*  the person who wins the House back is you. You're the chair of the DCCC in the 2006 election, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1524.88s)]
*  which is a huge, huge Democratic way of victory. And I've been thinking a lot about 2004, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1529.92s)]
*  which is maybe where I want to start. Because 2004 to me felt the most for Democrats like 2024, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1536.24s)]
*  of anything at least in my memory. George W. Bush, it was known by then that the Iraq War was sold [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1544.8000000000002s)]
*  on lies. It was known by then that the Iraq War was proving to be a disaster. There's a sense that [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1550.08s)]
*  who Bush was hadn't been fully understood in 2000. He was an accidental president. There were [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1556.3999999999999s)]
*  butterfly ballots in Florida. He had lost the popular vote. And then in 2004, when it is known, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1561.1999999999998s)]
*  when the consequences of his policies are seemingly more clear, at least to liberals, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1567.04s)]
*  he wins in a much more decisive fashion. And day after, there's a huge backlash against and inside [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1573.28s)]
*  the Democratic Party that feels very similar to today. Democrats have lost touch with the [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1581.04s)]
*  heartland is one of the arguments. They have been too liberal on gay marriage. There were these gay [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1586.56s)]
*  marriage ballot initiatives that were partially blamed for their loss. There's a sense that [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1591.44s)]
*  Democrats need to moderate. They need to move to the center. They need to regain a connection to [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1595.04s)]
*  an America that they no longer know or understand. And there's not just a confusion, but a sense of [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1600.0s)]
*  alienation. That's at least how I would describe it. But let me ask you how you understood the 2004 [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1605.44s)]
*  election when it happened. 2004 felt more like a gut punch really to the solar plex because everything [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1611.76s)]
*  else you could kind of explain away. 2002, the Republicans win in the midterm, first election [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1621.12s)]
*  post 9-11. You could explain that. 2000, you can say the Supreme Court, the national U.S. Supreme [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1627.92s)]
*  Court cheated the Florida Supreme Court from doing their responsibility and made a decision [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1634.3200000000002s)]
*  quote unquote only for this one case. To me, that was illegitimate. But by 2004, winning an election [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1638.64s)]
*  outright, no more trying to explain away a problem. And in 2004, you can sit there and play out how [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1645.1200000000001s)]
*  John Kerry ran the idea that you could take a guy like President Bush who skirted on his own [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1654.24s)]
*  responsibilities with the National Guard, and yet John Kerry serves in Vietnam, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1662.72s)]
*  serves his country, puts on the uniform, et cetera. Part of his whole, not just biography, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1667.3600000000001s)]
*  but his political legitimacy. And it turns out to be seen as weak on national security. And you can [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1672.16s)]
*  argue President Bush illegitimately attacked his character and his service. I think [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1678.72s)]
*  when you look back at the campaign, then Senator Kerry totally mismanaged his campaign, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1686.16s)]
*  talking about like on Iraq, I was for it before I was against it. Just [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1692.72s)]
*  major things that become character references and character points to him. So the way I look at [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1696.5600000000002s)]
*  2004 is my conversation with Nancy Pelosi when she calls to ask me literally the first week [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1703.04s)]
*  afterwards to run the DCCC for 06 election. And I think that 04, there was no more hiding and [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1708.24s)]
*  making excuses to ourselves what we had lost. You couldn't use the 22,500 ballots in Florida, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1715.36s)]
*  not legitimate, et cetera. We had lost three elections in a row. And there was a fundamental [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1722.8799999999999s)]
*  problem, both on the quality of the people we were putting forward and the message we were [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1728.1599999999999s)]
*  putting forward. Well, when you say we were it, right? This is one of the questions I think is [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1732.48s)]
*  interesting about 04. And maybe it's an overly optimistic one for Democrats to look at because [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1737.52s)]
*  Republicans then, Karl Rove said quite a lot in this direction, believe they were building a [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1743.04s)]
*  realignment. They believe they were building a permanent majority of some kind. They thought [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1749.1200000000001s)]
*  that 2004 foretold a reshaping of American politics. And two years later, and then four [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1754.08s)]
*  years later, it doesn't look anything like that. And the fear that Democrats have lost touch and [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1760.88s)]
*  need to become, I don't exactly want to say Republican light, but I do want to say Republican [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1769.44s)]
*  light is also not their path back to victory. No, that's not, I mean, I'm not saying you're [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1774.96s)]
*  saying that. I'm saying that was a very common piece of punditry at that moment. I think, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1780.64s)]
*  let me say this, there are issues in which you want to sand down the difference so there isn't [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1784.5600000000002s)]
*  a difference. And the reason you want to is to move them to your favorable terrain. But there's [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1789.92s)]
*  a reason I went out and recruited candidates on the national security front. If you're going to [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1797.1200000000001s)]
*  flip a Republican district, you're going to take all these cultural issues because the biography [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1804.64s)]
*  told a story. They had a legitimacy based on their experience and their story, their biography, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1810.0800000000002s)]
*  their life's work made that swing voter culturally comfortable. That created a space [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1817.28s)]
*  for then the rest of the story to get told. We both had an agenda that differed with President [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1825.92s)]
*  Bush. And I would just, for the record, last time the minimum wage got raised was right after 2006 [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1831.2s)]
*  election. There was a actual strategic plan, both on the policy side and on the county recruitment [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1836.6399999999999s)]
*  side. And it was a hand in glove. And yes, I got, I mean, you can go back, Ezra, I think you and I [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1843.84s)]
*  started to get to know each other. I was getting pummeled. I wasn't recruiting real Democrats, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1850.3999999999999s)]
*  football players, sheriffs, people that worked in the Air Force, armed forces of this country [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1854.3999999999999s)]
*  fought overseas. There were other people, small business owners, all types of people were recruited. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1860.32s)]
*  Why? Because there was a connectivity between the voters in that district that was, and you got to [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1866.32s)]
*  go back. Those districts were created to be literally a firewall against Democrats. They were [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1872.56s)]
*  gerrymandered so you couldn't pick the lock. We picked the lock with candidates in districts that [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1880.8799999999999s)]
*  you were not supposed to be able to do it. Now it is the sixth year of the President, very unpopular [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1889.12s)]
*  war. And we prosecuted the war. And the war was built on a building blocks of deception. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1893.36s)]
*  And it was a prepudiation in the sixth year of President Bush's presidency. And then we shouldn't [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1903.12s)]
*  over-forget this. In 04, they did think Karl Rove and others, that they were building a lasting [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1908.08s)]
*  coalition, realigning politics. And they overshot the runway on social security. He never mentions [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1914.1599999999999s)]
*  it. And then comes the first thing he's going to do is, I have a mandate for social security. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1920.4s)]
*  Well, bring it on. Let's go. Because it drew the contrast where you wanted the terrain to be on [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1923.8400000000001s)]
*  your side. And we minimized the terrain on their side. That's how you develop a strategy. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1929.8400000000001s)]
*  And not only did we win 30 seats in 06, we went back and won more seats in 08 in the presidential [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1937.68s)]
*  year. And followed a similar playbook. And in 2018, it was replicated again in the first [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1942.72s)]
*  midterm of President Trump's first term. That candidate recruitment, the issues you focus on, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1949.92s)]
*  where you move the shift, the campaign storyline to the most favorable terrain. It's not different [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1958.08s)]
*  than what President Clinton did by addressing the set of cultural issues. It's not different [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1965.28s)]
*  than what President Obama did in prosecuting both against Romney and then against John McCain in [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1973.84s)]
*  the earlier 08. There are certain issues you differentiate and you have clear contrast. And [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1979.12s)]
*  there are certain issues in which you don't. That's how you run a campaign. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1984.96s)]
*  If you were thinking about that for right now, and we haven't seen the [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1989.92s)]
*  Trump administration, the second Trump administration begin, we haven't seen it take [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1996.56s)]
*  shape. We don't know if there will be an analog to social security. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=1999.76s)]
*  Okay, I got this question because I've been thinking, yes. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2002.48s)]
*  But yes, what as you sit up at night. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2004.88s)]
*  Or as Henry Kissinger used to say, does anybody have questions for my answers? Yes, I have. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2007.76s)]
*  I have this. Here's what frustrates me. Look, Donald Trump, I do agree that President Trump, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2012.0s)]
*  I keep doing that, he's President like Trump, is a threat to democracy. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2021.36s)]
*  We have those voters on hello. If they think that the issue of threat to democracy, threat to the [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2027.92s)]
*  rule of law, if they're not a yes by now, they're never going to be a yes. We had them on hello. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2036.8s)]
*  President Trump is going to turn the Oval Office into eBay. He is going to sell it to every special [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2042.96s)]
*  interest and you're going to be left paying that tab. And the Democratic Party is the thin blue line [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2050.56s)]
*  between the pharmaceutical industry getting everything they want or you paying everything [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2055.92s)]
*  you have. The Democratic Party is a thin blue line that will protect your kids from TikTok. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2060.0s)]
*  The Oval Office will become eBay and whoever pays the highest price will get what they want [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2066.8s)]
*  and you'll be left paying through the nose. We should have turned what people think. This is what [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2072.48s)]
*  polling and focus groups are about. They do have a preview of President Trump, both his character [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2080.48s)]
*  and his strengths, his weaknesses. We never prosecuted the case of how his, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2087.92s)]
*  not just character, but how he's going to run the Oval Office and he did it. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2095.04s)]
*  He used to say, oh, they give me lots of money. I'm going to give them, you know, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2098.4s)]
*  like the oil and gas industry. They give me a billion dollars. I'm going to give them all [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2102.08s)]
*  the cuts and regulations. He has a very funny line on this with Elon Musk. He said, I don't like [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2107.68s)]
*  electric vehicles, but now Elon Musk supports me. So I got to. Yeah. He was against TikTok before [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2112.16s)]
*  he was for it and your kids are going to be controlled by the Chinese. We never prosecuted [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2116.96s)]
*  what the Oval Office is going to look like under Donald Trump and how much you're going to pay for [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2121.6s)]
*  it. We prosecute, like give you an example, take what I think President Biden did successfully, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2125.12s)]
*  which is get the ability to negotiate pharmaceutical prices down and negotiate with [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2130.88s)]
*  the pharmaceutical industry and you got lower prices on insulin. We wanted to talk about the [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2135.92s)]
*  benefit we did. No, the first president took the pharmaceutical industry and beat the living crap [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2139.92s)]
*  out of them. And if we're not there, the thin blue line, you're going to go back to paying right [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2145.7599999999998s)]
*  through the nose. And President Trump, as you just, by example, oil and gas industry, EVs with Elon [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2149.92s)]
*  Musk, TikTok, it was a target rich environment and we left it. We ran around around democracy [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2156.2400000000002s)]
*  and the rule of law, which I agree with, but guess what? We had those voters. It was the other ones [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2164.7200000000003s)]
*  we needed. We talked about what made us feel so good about ourselves. Like we're all, this is the [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2170.8s)]
*  other thing. I mean, now I'm, I really do hope you take Blue Cross Blue Shield because I got to get [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2176.4s)]
*  this off. It's like, think about this as a party, not just that we didn't prosecute the case that was [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2181.28s)]
*  fully present and actually fits with what people are worried about, about Donald Trump. We talked [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2187.6800000000003s)]
*  about what we cared about, not what they wanted to hear, but also think about how we talk about any [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2195.76s)]
*  issue as a party. This is what drives me. Okay. But take this, the caring economy. I have never [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2201.36s)]
*  met anybody who's described themselves in the caring economy. I've met social workers. I met [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2208.96s)]
*  daycare workers. I met nurses, RNs. I never met anybody who says I'm in the caring economy, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2214.8s)]
*  but we talked about it. You know, when you attack people and I say this, my uncle was a police [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2220.8s)]
*  officer, et cetera, defund the police. And they said, well, it doesn't mean that. Well, then don't [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2225.52s)]
*  use the English language. If it doesn't mean what you said it was, don't use the English language. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2229.76s)]
*  Okay. Start speaking as Japanese, French, but don't say what you just said and then tell me [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2235.44s)]
*  it doesn't mean that. Latinx and people that it's supposed to be appealed to, it doesn't represent [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2240.4s)]
*  them. We talk about people of color. Anybody who's been a mayor in a big, in a city knows that [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2246.4s)]
*  doesn't exist. We use language to feel good about ourselves, not to communicate. We all think we're [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2252.48s)]
*  applying to be adjunct professors at a small liberal arts college. We come off exactly like [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2258.96s)]
*  who we are. It's insane. And the case against Donald Trump. Now, again, I want to be honest. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2263.68s)]
*  I've been in Tokyo for three years. It pretty clear. It wasn't democracy and the rule of law. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2271.2s)]
*  After the last eight years, he's been in the public life. That was apparent. And everything [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2279.36s)]
*  that was all the gold that you could have gotten out of that you had. It was the other [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2284.16s)]
*  piece of the story that actually mattered to people's pocketbooks. And he will, and you can [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2289.52s)]
*  see by the cabinet that president elect Trump is putting together, he will turn the oval office, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2296.0s)]
*  not only to the special interests who president Biden fought, whether it was on oil and gas, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2302.16s)]
*  whether it was pharmaceutical prices, took on every one of those special interests who had [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2307.04s)]
*  had control of Washington. He broke their hold and Donald Trump is going to let him back in. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2311.36s)]
*  And not only back in, you're going to pay for it every day. And we never prosecuted the other piece [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2318.6400000000003s)]
*  of it. The American dream is unaffordable. The American dream is inaccessible and it's unacceptable [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2324.6400000000003s)]
*  to us. The idea that people can walk around with multiple homes and a family can't get a home, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2333.2000000000003s)]
*  can't afford a retirement, can't afford their kids education is unacceptable. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2340.7999999999997s)]
*  There's a whole case to be made. Isn't that a hard case to make when it's worst in the places [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2347.84s)]
*  where Democrats govern? No, not at all. Because you're thinking about it because I don't want [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2352.48s)]
*  to criticize you on your show. I'm a fair target on my show, man. No, no, no. Because you're thinking [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2359.52s)]
*  linear. This is about where your heart is. This is about where your sentiment is. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2367.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I want to go back to Bill Clinton, but as he said in the snows in New Hampshire, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2374.48s)]
*  when his draft letter is out, the hits on me are nothing compared to the hits your kids are going [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2381.8399999999997s)]
*  to take if we don't turn this country around. Now, I didn't say to you one policy right there. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2386.96s)]
*  It's a sentiment about where your heart and soul is. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2392.4s)]
*  Somebody's got to stand up and fight for real change. Look, this is a contact sport. I knew [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2395.92s)]
*  all this would happen or I knew something like this would happen. This is not about me. I can [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2400.56s)]
*  handle this. What's the worst can happen to me? I go home to my family, my friends, my life, my job. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2405.2000000000003s)]
*  This is not a big deal for me. It is a very big deal for the political process and that's where [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2411.52s)]
*  I want to leave it. I want to see this election fought out on what we're going to do to change [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2417.76s)]
*  the future of the people of this country. And most of the people do too, and they are being robbed [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2422.8s)]
*  of the chance to do it. That's the point I want to make. I mean, I have my own criticism of what [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2427.1200000000003s)]
*  what are tough things and how Democrats things make things more difficult than they need to be [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2432.1600000000003s)]
*  to get things done. As a former mayor trying to get a train station opened up and how many [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2437.28s)]
*  multiple environmental studies you have to do at the city level, the state level, the federal level. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2442.64s)]
*  There is a need for reform and we got to be honest about it. But the fact that it's more what I'm [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2447.92s)]
*  talking about, whether it's owning a home, saving for your kids education, saving for your retirement, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2452.96s)]
*  being able to afford a health care expense without going into chapter 11. That is not only a sentiment [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2457.44s)]
*  but also where your heart and soul is. People are, yes, you are right, linear, Ezra. What are the [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2463.8399999999997s)]
*  policies to do that? But they really just want to know, do you get it? Do you know where they are? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2469.52s)]
*  I used to, I mean, there was a whole thing we started about what I called Congress on your [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2476.0s)]
*  corner. And I used to meet people at grocery stores, not town halls, but just where they live [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2482.48s)]
*  their lives, where they're shopping. And if they wanted to come over and talk about Medicare, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2488.56s)]
*  Medicaid, veterans benefits, immigration issues, schools, some of my best policies that I introduced [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2495.2s)]
*  came from those times where I met people at a grocery store, Congress on your corner. So when [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2501.9199999999996s)]
*  you say, oh, well, that's the worst in cities. I don't agree with that. It just kind of broad brush. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2506.72s)]
*  That said, there's enough problems that we could be the party that reforms government, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2512.96s)]
*  makes it more responsive to people. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2516.8799999999997s)]
*  I want to pick up on that idea of reform and corruption. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2525.2s)]
*  I was thinking this week and talking to people in politics who actually run in and win elections. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2551.9199999999996s)]
*  And this kept coming up that in 1994, one of the absolute best issues for Republicans in retaking [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2557.68s)]
*  Congress for the first time in 40 years was reform. They ran on term limits, on balanced budget, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2566.8799999999997s)]
*  right? They ran against Democrats as corrupt and out of touch. People really, I think, forget how [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2572.7999999999997s)]
*  much Barack Obama's 2008 campaign was a reformist campaign. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2578.08s)]
*  He ran against special interests, against cable news, against political consultants. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2608.08s)]
*  He was somebody who ran as disgusted with the way Washington worked. In 2016, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2624.48s)]
*  Donald Trump ran as a political reformer, a wrecking ball to drain the swamp. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2629.44s)]
*  The people's agenda is not to be changed unless you drain the swamp that is Washington, D.C. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2638.72s)]
*  In this election, one of the things that happened was Democrats became [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2656.08s)]
*  very much synonymous with the institutions. Joe Biden is both the president and has been in [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2660.96s)]
*  Washington for many decades. Kamala Harris is the vice president of that administration. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2665.76s)]
*  One thing that just did not exist in the Democratic campaign was any kind of reformist impulse. There [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2671.0400000000004s)]
*  was Donald Trump who hates the way Washington works and the Democrats who were there to defend [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2679.6000000000004s)]
*  Washington from Donald Trump. Look, reform as well as corruption aren't the same thing. Yes, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2685.2000000000003s)]
*  they also are heads and tails of the same coin. This is also why in Europe you're getting people [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2692.32s)]
*  running races against Brussels. We don't fully, as I can say, this is a former mayor of big city. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2697.6000000000004s)]
*  Government is way too big and cumbersome. It is too hard to do basic things. We end up defending [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2704.32s)]
*  the rules rather than the results. We need to be the party that is for the results. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2716.0s)]
*  If the government is a problem or the rules and regulations that we have the right purpose but [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2723.12s)]
*  are becoming their own problem, we're defending something that is indefensible. Look, a classic [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2728.4s)]
*  example. If climate change, which I agree, is an existential crisis, you don't leave it just to [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2735.68s)]
*  FERC. It's either an existential crisis or FERC is the greatest thing that ever existed. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2741.52s)]
*  FERC being the group that does transmission line regulations and permitting. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2746.08s)]
*  I'm just thank you for explaining what I said. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2751.12s)]
*  Democrats seem a lot of touch to me, Ram. Too many acronyms. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2754.4s)]
*  I have a rule here as ambassador. One acronym per paragraph. Okay, that's it. No more. Look, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2758.16s)]
*  I agree climate change is an existential crisis, but you can't tell me it's an existential crisis. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2764.16s)]
*  The way FERC operates to agree to get a transmission line in, which has a seven-year [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2770.32s)]
*  backlog, is perfect. Never to be touched. We're going to defend FERC. I understand the role it [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2774.2400000000002s)]
*  plays. Are you telling me there's nothing we can do that guarantees an end result in two years so [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2780.48s)]
*  we can actually do what we said we were going to do, get transmission lines that can handle solar, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2786.56s)]
*  wind, and other renewables? It's crazy. On the face of it, it's crazy. It's an existential crisis [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2791.84s)]
*  that will wait seven years for a result to build a transmission line from one city to another. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2799.04s)]
*  My grandfather said, the great political philosopher Hermann Schmolowitz, what are you, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2805.12s)]
*  Miss Sugina? This is crazy. I did an L-stop near McCormick Place, a train stop in Chicago. We had [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2808.8s)]
*  to do an environmental study. After we were done, the state did an environmental study, another 18 [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2816.32s)]
*  months. After both of us were done, we sent it up to Washington. They did another environmental [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2820.08s)]
*  study. Really? You're telling me there's nothing we can do? It took three years to put a train [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2824.64s)]
*  station on an empty lot. It's crazy. One reason this is a hard case for Democrats to make is [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2830.72s)]
*  there's nothing they did. Specifically here, this has been a frustration for me because I focus [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2837.04s)]
*  much too much probably on environmental permitting and siting. Look, the Biden [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2842.56s)]
*  administration, the administration you're part of as ambassador, their signal accomplishment is [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2846.64s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act, which is primarily built around decarbonization investments and [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2851.76s)]
*  alongside that, the infrastructure bill. And healthcare. I think that's an important [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2856.32s)]
*  thing that was in there, but I'm going to say the climate investments were the big piece of that. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2860.48s)]
*  I got it. They did not ever put forward, even though they know and they have said publicly that [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2864.0800000000004s)]
*  a huge problem is getting this stuff built quickly, they did not ever put forward their own [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2870.6400000000003s)]
*  significant permitting reform plan, bill, anything. They supported the Joe Manchin plan that [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2875.68s)]
*  eventually emerged, which was a mixed bag to say the least, but because it would split their own [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2882.16s)]
*  coalition, because permitting reform is a difficult issue for Democrats, because a lot of the [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2887.68s)]
*  environmental groups don't like it, they never came out and said, this is what we think we should do [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2891.44s)]
*  to truly speed this up. The party should have done what I don't, and I'm not here to try to relive [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2896.88s)]
*  Bill Clinton, the Al Gore. It worked. The Al Gore commission that reformed government. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2902.24s)]
*  It did actually cut bureaucrats in Washington, rules and regulations, and it funded adding [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2907.68s)]
*  a hundred thousand community police officers throughout the country, which actually is starting [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2913.52s)]
*  in 94. If you take 10 years after 94 versus 10 years before 94, you can look at the difference [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2919.3599999999997s)]
*  between crime rates. It worked on a reforming government. It also worked on funding public [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2924.08s)]
*  safety and other initiatives that Democrats cared about. We should be against government [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2929.84s)]
*  rules. Now, let me side note, this is not the core of your question. People always say democracy's [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2935.84s)]
*  broken. It's not. It's very successful at the state and local level where people have trust in [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2941.44s)]
*  their government and feel it touches their lives and they have a connection to it. It's broken in [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2946.48s)]
*  Brussels and in Washington, the farther government gets away, where only rules and regulations are [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2952.0s)]
*  what we care about and processes. We never ever talk about the results. We defend a status quo [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2957.2s)]
*  that is broken. We're insane doing it politically and it's not actually accurate about what it's [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2963.52s)]
*  trying to accomplish. And then there's a side piece. I laughed when I was snickering here, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2970.56s)]
*  you can't tell. When President Obama becomes a senator, I'm a congressman of Illinois and Chicago. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2976.08s)]
*  Marty Meehan, my colleague in the House, and Senator Obama, Russ Feingold, John McCain, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2985.36s)]
*  we worked on a lobbying and ethics reform legislation and it passed it. I think it was [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2991.76s)]
*  Chris Shays, who was a Republican in the House who worked with us on it. It was bipartisan, etc. Yeah, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=2999.76s)]
*  fighting and it was coming on the heels. We fought against all the corruption that you used to talk [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3005.6s)]
*  about, public corruption, but a lot of people also saw the war and the way it was prosecuted [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3012.88s)]
*  at that time as corruption. It wasn't this distinct piece of government rules, regulations, money, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3017.28s)]
*  lobbyists, access, etc. They also thought the way Washington worked, how we got ourselves [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3026.48s)]
*  deceptively into a war, was corruption. And so we worked on that together and it was what [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3031.6s)]
*  President Obama ran on because we had worked on it when he was a senator and I was a congressman. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3037.92s)]
*  It was a legislation we introduced and passed. And again, whether it's the integrity of public service [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3043.0400000000004s)]
*  or whether it's also knowing that the system and the rules and regulations are not producing the [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3050.88s)]
*  results we want, we as part of the establishment have adopted the voice of defending the establishment [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3056.7200000000003s)]
*  when it's failing. It makes no sense policy-wise and it's absolutely a dead failure politically. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3064.32s)]
*  Why do you think Democrats have done that? You're asking me Democrats and it's like a lot of us, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3072.1600000000003s)]
*  but- Why do you think that has happened? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3077.04s)]
*  I know it's, I think it's happened because we're comfortable in being the establishment. We're [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3080.32s)]
*  comfortable with what we have built and defended. Even Franklin Delano Roosevelt talked about [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3087.84s)]
*  constantly reforming, constantly changing. If it doesn't succeed, throw it out, try something else. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3093.28s)]
*  I want to tell a little anecdote to illustrate a point. In the balanced budget negotiations in 1997 [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3097.84s)]
*  when we get to kids' health care, President Clinton had pediatric care, eye and dental care, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3105.6800000000003s)]
*  paid through Medicaid expansion to take kids whose parents worked, made more money than Medicaid, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3112.8s)]
*  get them health care. The Republicans had only pediatric care, no eye and dental, but it had to [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3120.08s)]
*  be a new program outside of Medicaid because they hated Medicaid. Final blah blah blah blah. Bruce [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3125.84s)]
*  Reid, James Burley, myself, we negotiate. It would be the president's health care plan, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3131.92s)]
*  pediatric care, eye and dental, but it would not be in Medicaid. And a number of Democrats voted [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3136.8s)]
*  against it because we weren't screaming about Medicaid. I said, you know, I got to say this as a [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3143.2000000000003s)]
*  son of a pediatrician. I know a lot of people think I'm something else, but [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3147.92s)]
*  people never talked about how they got paid. They cared about whether the kids had eye and dental [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3152.8s)]
*  care. That's what the priorities are. And we were a defender of how it was going to be funded rather [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3157.12s)]
*  than what the result was. The result of kids' health care plan was to get kids' health care, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3162.56s)]
*  not to fight about which government program paid it or whether it was a new one. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3168.48s)]
*  I get the point. It's very important if you work at the Brookings Institute in Aspen. It is not [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3172.4s)]
*  important if you're a working mother and you're single and you're trying to figure out how to get [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3177.28s)]
*  your children health care and make sure they have sunglasses so they can read the blackboard. That's [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3181.2000000000003s)]
*  what matters. And we lost people because it wasn't Medicaid expansion. And again, it's legitimate. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3185.84s)]
*  It's just not more important than the end result, which was health care for children. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3192.48s)]
*  I think the critique is that- I think this show is very good for my emotional health. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3199.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm happy to hear that. We try to provide many levels of service here at the Ezra Klein show. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3202.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't think you actually get full benefit of what you're doing. So yeah. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3209.7599999999998s)]
*  The critique I hear is that the reason the Democratic Party does not want to change more [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3214.16s)]
*  or does not focus more on changing the way things work is that many of the people in it benefit from [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3220.16s)]
*  it. And they benefit from it in ways that are legitimate and straightforward. They work for [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3223.92s)]
*  programs that they want those programs to be funded. They use powers like the ability to sue [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3229.36s)]
*  under the environmental litigation. They often use it for good reasons, but then they don't want it [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3235.84s)]
*  foreclosed on them, even if it's having bad effects elsewhere. And there's a view that there's [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3240.32s)]
*  corruption in the Democratic Party too. There's views that Nancy Pelosi did not want to change [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3245.1200000000003s)]
*  the rules on insider trading of individual stocks among members of Congress. But there is a sense [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3250.8s)]
*  that Democrats are in this system, making money, having good jobs, being inside the revolving door, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3256.24s)]
*  and that you can't trust them to change a system they benefit from, all the way from the staffers [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3262.24s)]
*  moving from place to place up to people like Rahm Emanuel and Nancy Pelosi who have done pretty [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3269.2799999999997s)]
*  well in politics. Well, look, I think the problem is you're conflating both reforming ethics and [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3273.9199999999996s)]
*  reforming the government the way it works. So I would just say to you, Ezra, that while they [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3285.36s)]
*  fit together, they're separate issues. The fact is the Democrats have always been the party, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3292.08s)]
*  not always, we have ups and downs on this, but fighting corruption. You can say that in my [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3298.32s)]
*  tenure as mayor, three different ethics packages. And I can continue to do that. And we have to be [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3304.32s)]
*  a party that is never satisfied, never the defenders of the status quo, always wanting [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3310.0s)]
*  to change something to make other people's lives better. And that's been our voice going back to [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3317.28s)]
*  whether it's Kennedy, Roosevelt, Truman, whatever, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3322.48s)]
*  pick your president. The fact is being satisfied with the way things are is not where people are. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3327.12s)]
*  But I think the argument here is that people in the Democratic Party benefit from the way things [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3335.3599999999997s)]
*  are. And they raise money from the way things are. And that's a tough thing about this system. You [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3340.56s)]
*  need money to run these elections. I was reading a bunch of old pieces, New Yorker profiles of you, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3345.4399999999996s)]
*  pieces about the 06 campaign, about the just difficulty of raising money in that campaign, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3350.48s)]
*  the decisions you all are making for this $100,000 or that $500,000. And the argument that has been [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3355.68s)]
*  made again and again is that in order to win in the system, you almost have to become a party [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3362.88s)]
*  that is a defender of the system. And that that's something in the end that in his own strange way, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3369.76s)]
*  Trump with his own money, Elon Musk with his own money, were able to exploit because people [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3375.6800000000003s)]
*  thought they were outside the system and as such not corrupted by it. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3380.88s)]
*  True and not true. That's why you prosecute a case that the Oval Office is going to become eBay. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3384.7200000000003s)]
*  And sell out. That's why you prosecute that case. Because if you're telling me that we're the only [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3388.96s)]
*  people, individuals that are making money on the system, which I don't accept the critique, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3398.56s)]
*  then you make it about the other side, which actually if you go look at the polling and the [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3405.04s)]
*  focus groups was more believable. One thing I wonder if Democrats are underestimating the danger [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3408.64s)]
*  of is the Vivek Ramaswamy Elon Musk Department of Government Efficiency. And you've got Musk [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3414.0s)]
*  who has an incredibly loud megaphone through X, which he owns and controls. And it's sitting [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3421.36s)]
*  outside the government. It's not exactly what power it will have. They're putting people like [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3427.92s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene in charge of important dimensions of this, which suggests to me they [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3432.0s)]
*  may not approach this in the most strategic and careful way. But nevertheless, you have something [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3438.32s)]
*  that can have incredible levels of media attention and publicity around it where Republicans are in a [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3444.4s)]
*  very high profile way going at at least what they call government inefficiency. What have you thought [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3449.6800000000003s)]
*  watching that thing stand up? And how do you think Democrats should respond to it? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3457.84s)]
*  I would say welcome it. And I would say 100% ready to meet with you. So let's go and have [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3462.56s)]
*  a full agenda that puts them on their back foot. And they have to make a choice between what they [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3468.16s)]
*  say they're for and what their actual interests are. The part of a political strategy is you put [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3473.7599999999998s)]
*  people in, you know, as Yogi Beria used to say, when you get to the fork in the road, take it. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3478.8799999999997s)]
*  And so that's what would be my approach. Not fight it. People want to reform something, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3483.2799999999997s)]
*  change something. I'm 100% for it. Let's go. Couldn't be more excited, ready to meet today. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3488.08s)]
*  And then I would put it down on the table and I'd have a full agenda, 10 items. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3493.8399999999997s)]
*  That is proactive, not waiting, not in the receiving. Don't say show me stuff. Here's what [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3498.64s)]
*  we want to get done. And then go right at the soft underbelly of the other side. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3503.8399999999997s)]
*  The flip side of that commission is that all of a sudden you have Ramaswamy who's on this show and [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3510.08s)]
*  has made the point that it is you Medicare and Medicaid are mistakes. You have Musk who is tweeting [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3515.92s)]
*  out Ron Paul clips. It reminds me a little bit of Bush and social security privatization where you [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3520.16s)]
*  have Trump, a candidate who did not run on massive spending cuts to government, who has now pointed [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3527.12s)]
*  people who have, who get attention on them in a way other people, you know, who are in his actual [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3534.96s)]
*  government will not, who seem very excited about cutting ideally trillions of dollars in government [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3541.2799999999997s)]
*  spending. The new person Trump is appointing Treasury Secretary has also talked about the need [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3547.3599999999997s)]
*  for very significant spending cuts. The Trump for a long time operated outside of the long running [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3551.68s)]
*  Republican desire to slash deep into government operations in ways that were often pretty unpopular. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3560.3199999999997s)]
*  And in his first term, Republicans spent more money and didn't pay for it and cut taxes and [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3566.3999999999996s)]
*  didn't pay for it. And now all of a sudden in the second term, it seems like there is a return, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3571.68s)]
*  but under a more Trump is banner of the hack and slash side of the Republican party. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3576.72s)]
*  Is that an opportunity for Democrats? Yes. They have inherent contradiction. They have people want [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3584.3199999999997s)]
*  to cut social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and they have a president who doesn't. That's like, go, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3589.92s)]
*  let's go for it. Let's go have this debate. Ready. And if they want to go after poor kids [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3595.44s)]
*  in nutritional programs, let's have it. They want to go after the subsidies we give single people [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3602.32s)]
*  who are small business owners, getting access to healthcare and have premium support. Let's have [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3608.48s)]
*  that. I'm ready. I will tell you this one anecdote and I'm named by President Obama, chief of staff. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3613.6000000000004s)]
*  So one of the things I first do when we get to watch it is I ask Senator McConnell, then the [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3622.0800000000004s)]
*  minority leader for a meeting and he brings his leadership. And Senator McConnell says, I think [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3627.36s)]
*  we should work on social security. And remember this is 08. The economy is literally going head [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3633.52s)]
*  first into a depression. And the idea that the first thing we're going to work on is social [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3639.6800000000003s)]
*  security. So I said, well, why don't we do this? There's a lot of ideas kicking around. Why don't [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3644.08s)]
*  you propose some legislation on social security, what your ideas are for reform. And I will tell [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3648.56s)]
*  you, we'll be open to hearing about them, but you're a big leader. You have a big platform. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3653.44s)]
*  Make your changes. We're going to work right now on getting the economy away from a depression. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3658.48s)]
*  And he kind of had this wry smile, knowing exactly what I was saying. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3662.96s)]
*  So if others in the Republican Party and President Trump's appointees want to propose [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3666.56s)]
*  cuts to social security, Medicare, Medicaid, put it out there. Be my guest. I got some ideas of how [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3671.92s)]
*  to expand healthcare coverage for people. You have ideas about how you want to cut it. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3679.28s)]
*  Fine. Let's have that debate. You've been floated by David Axelrod among others for Democratic [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3683.84s)]
*  National Committee Chair. Is that a job you want? I think I want the Democrats to get back being the [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3689.6000000000004s)]
*  majority party and fighting for the families and their children. Whether I'm going to finish up [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3695.92s)]
*  my job in the next month here in Tokyo. I have three things I got to get done. Feel very good [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3703.0400000000004s)]
*  about the tenure here in the Alliance. And when I get back to America and back to my home in Chicago, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3708.48s)]
*  I'll make my decision of what I'm going to do. The best way I think I can do that. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3716.0s)]
*  Whoever is DNC chair next, what should the DNC be? Political parties are something very different [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3720.72s)]
*  than they were three generations ago, two generations ago. They go back and forth right now. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3729.2s)]
*  Lara Trump is the co-chair of the Republican National Committee. That's become a much more [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3735.12s)]
*  personalist party. When you look at the Democratic Party, and you've been a Democratic Party man for [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3740.08s)]
*  many, many years now and serving in many different dimensions of it, what do you think the party [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3746.08s)]
*  should do? What role should it play in people's lives? What is a political party in the year [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3751.2799999999997s)]
*  2024? And what should it be in the year 2030? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3758.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, you got to deal with the here and now and then you got to plan for the long term. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3762.7200000000003s)]
*  So one is within a year, you're going to have a very important election for governor of New [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3768.2400000000002s)]
*  Jersey and governor of Virginia, and you're going to have state house elections. Now, you got to [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3774.1600000000003s)]
*  make sure you have the resources for that and the ability to support the candidates who get [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3780.88s)]
*  the nomination and to make the most of what will be one year into President Trump's tenure. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3786.48s)]
*  And one of the things I think Democrats have to do if I was at DNC and working with the party [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3792.2400000000002s)]
*  chairs, but I'm not that is we are going to have every position, every county, somebody's going to [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3797.68s)]
*  have a name on the ballot. Because if it's a referendum election, you want to have people [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3804.16s)]
*  in pole position. And you got to have the infrastructure to do that, both the old shoe [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3808.56s)]
*  leather plus digital, not one or the other. But then there's the ideas. We have spent eight years [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3813.6s)]
*  telling everybody what we're against on Donald Trump. We're very anti the Trump. We haven't [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3820.96s)]
*  filled out the profile what we're pro America. Now, I'm a product like everybody else is of my [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3826.72s)]
*  tenure. You could go back to President Clinton's three covenant speeches. He filled out that he [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3833.52s)]
*  was not just against 12 years of Reagan and Bush. But here's what we got to do, as he would say, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3838.64s)]
*  to build a bridge to the 21st century, so everybody can get across that bridge. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3844.3199999999997s)]
*  So you have to not just build an identity, opposing Trump, you have to also build an identity of [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3848.7999999999997s)]
*  who you're fighting for, why you're fighting, who you're fighting against, and what you're [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3856.24s)]
*  fighting for the end result to be. And a party can help build that. Now, in past times, when Bill [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3859.44s)]
*  Clinton was head of the DLC, that was the intellectual energy, the Democratic leadership [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3865.44s)]
*  circle for that kind of intellectual work. So a party has to do both of those, not only win [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3870.96s)]
*  elections, not only help Ruku Kennedy, not only fund them, not only have the infrastructure, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3876.96s)]
*  but then have the intellectual healthy debate about where we're going to go as a party, and how [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3880.8s)]
*  we're going to do that. You talked about finding candidates in 2006 that defied the stereotypes of [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3886.08s)]
*  the Democratic Party and helped pick the locks in Republican districts, candidates who had a [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3893.2s)]
*  different profile on national security or law enforcement. Given what this moment is, given [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3898.56s)]
*  the types of places in which Democrats are struggling, or rural districts, working class [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3905.12s)]
*  voters, who are those candidates now? If you were either overseeing or advising [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3909.9199999999996s)]
*  a Democratic congressional campaign committee chair working on candidate recruitment, who are [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3917.2s)]
*  you looking for? You know, it's interesting if you look at some of the front runners in both the New [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3921.52s)]
*  Jersey governor's race and the Virginia governor's race. I think Gottheimer in Jersey, Spenberger in [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3925.52s)]
*  Virginia, both have been independent enough that they've taken on their own party. It's part of [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3933.84s)]
*  their character. It's part of their profile. They're not just a yes person. They have fought, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3939.7599999999998s)]
*  whether it's leadership or interest groups. Well, there's going to be a primary, they've got to win [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3946.72s)]
*  it. But it's interesting to me that those are some of the names battling around. I think independence [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3951.7599999999998s)]
*  is a streak that I'm going to look for. That if I was sitting here and I could like, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3958.56s)]
*  give me somebody that ran against the grain, said publicly what people are thinking, but didn't have [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3964.08s)]
*  the courage, but they did. So their independence as a quality, that gives them kind of the anti-establishment, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3970.0s)]
*  the anti-elite tone. I'm sitting here at 10,000 feet, two years, you know, we're not [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3976.88s)]
*  about three weeks away from the last election. To me, independence, saying things that are [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3982.32s)]
*  politically correct, willing to take on not just ex-interest group or whatever, but even your own [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3989.04s)]
*  party's interest group or leadership. To me, that's the gold mine I want to go work in. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=3996.48s)]
*  Democrats are watching with a lot of alarm at nominations like Hegseth for defense, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4004.64s)]
*  nominations like Tulsi Gabbard for national intelligence. They're very obviously worried [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4012.48s)]
*  about the Matt Gaetz nomination that has been since withdrawn or replaced by Pam Bondi. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4018.56s)]
*  There are things Donald Trump is doing and will do that have more of the flavor of authoritarianism, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4022.72s)]
*  more of the flavor of installing loyalists in key roles where the government could be weaponized. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4028.96s)]
*  On the one hand, I think that is the most dangerous set of things I see him [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4035.52s)]
*  at least seeming to be interested in. On the other hand, those may not be the things that most [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4040.4s)]
*  Americans care about or even really believe you on. Those are not pocketbook issues, those are not [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4046.8s)]
*  necessarily corruption that will line his pockets. There's going to be, at least sometimes, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4053.92s)]
*  this choice Democrats need to make between the things that scare them most and the things that [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4061.2000000000003s)]
*  if you're watching a focus group or thinking about what will help in a forthcoming election, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4067.52s)]
*  you really want to make the center of your message over and over and over and over again. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4074.64s)]
*  How do you think about that trade-off when you are trying to oppose or block [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4079.04s)]
*  someone who does seem to have authoritarian at least pretenses? [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4083.52s)]
*  President Trump and his team, it's going to be a target-rich environment of things you're going [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4088.24s)]
*  to oppose, but not everything has to be opposed. You're going to have to be disciplined about you [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4092.16s)]
*  pick and choose where you're going to have the fight. If you fight everything, part of his [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4097.84s)]
*  strategy is to so overwhelm the system, you're going to drown in it. When it comes to a cabinet, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4103.68s)]
*  this may be the old chief of staff of me. If you're on the other side of this, you're going to [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4108.4s)]
*  have to pick where you're going to, you can't do the whole cabinet and you can't do all of them. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4112.48s)]
*  You can't do just you want to do national security. If you're Democrats organizing this, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4117.44s)]
*  you're going to have to look at the whole field, what makes Republicans most uncomfortable. They're [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4124.48s)]
*  not going to break from the president on all of them. What puts them in the weakest position, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4129.839999999999s)]
*  not only vis-a-vis the White House, but what puts them in the weakest position vis-a-vis [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4134.64s)]
*  the American people? Then that person and that fight becomes character defining of the other side [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4138.320000000001s)]
*  and character defining for your side. So I look at this and I look at Tulsi Gabbard as a place [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4146.320000000001s)]
*  when you look at all the information and they'll run a process that's going to make the Republicans [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4155.360000000001s)]
*  in the Senate very, very uncomfortable, very uncomfortable. There's a tactical win there and [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4160.4s)]
*  it will expose certain things. And so you have to think of it both tactically and strategically. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4166.4s)]
*  And then which fights do I want to beat the more prominent, not just about the people, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4171.28s)]
*  but about other things. I happen to think that we want to be the party that positions that Donald [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4174.879999999999s)]
*  Trump and the Republicans are now the establishment. They're pulled into a whole set of special [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4181.12s)]
*  interests and you are not in their line of sight except for your pocketbook. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4185.52s)]
*  Look, you're going to have an attempt to politicize the federal reserve. You're going [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4190.96s)]
*  to have a massive discussion, raising of tariffs, and you're going to talk about another couple [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4194.56s)]
*  trillion dollars to the national debt and deficit. I think at a certain point there's a possibility [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4199.76s)]
*  that the credibility of the United States could get hit. Not only is inflation not going to go [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4205.68s)]
*  down, it's going to continue to go up. And I think we can make an argument that you're going [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4210.56s)]
*  to be paying the cost for these individuals and in the special interests that they represent. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4214.16s)]
*  You talked about autocracy and the threat to democracy. We have people on that. It's what [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4218.0s)]
*  they're going to do to your wallet and your children that I want to protect. And there's [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4223.84s)]
*  going to be a set of events when it comes to cost and affordability that is going to be real. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4228.639999999999s)]
*  And you're setting it up not just for that individual fight, but from here all the way [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4234.96s)]
*  through the midterm up to 2028. And I could be wrong and maybe somebody else has a different [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkkVATgetNU&t=4238.8s)]
