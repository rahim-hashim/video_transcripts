# Don't Believe Him | The Ezra Klein Show
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s)
*  If you want to understand the first few weeks of the second Trump administration, go back [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=0.0s)]
*  and listen to what Steve Bannon told PBS's Frontline in 2019. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=4.8s)]
*  The opposition party is the media. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=9.1s)]
*  And the media can only, because they're dumb and they're lazy, they can only focus on one [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=11.26s)]
*  thing at a time. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=15.92s)]
*  All we have to do is flood the zone. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=17.0s)]
*  Every day we hit them with three things. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=19.28s)]
*  They'll bite on one and we'll get all of our stuff done. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=21.44s)]
*  Pang, bang, bang. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=24.28s)]
*  These guys will never, will never be able to recover. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=25.64s)]
*  But we've got to start with muzzle velocity. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=28.02s)]
*  So it's got to start, it's got to hammer, it's got to... [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=30.4s)]
*  What is the word? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=32.86s)]
*  Muzzle velocity. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=33.86s)]
*  Muzzle velocity. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=34.86s)]
*  Bannon's insight there is real. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=35.86s)]
*  Focus is a fundamental substance of democracy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=38.82s)]
*  It is particularly the substance of opposition. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=41.58s)]
*  People largely learn of what the government is doing through the media. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  So if you overwhelm the media... [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=47.82s)]
*  A record-setting number of executive orders. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  Everybody pardons. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=52.78s)]
*  Violence, nonviolence. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=53.78s)]
*  Including assaulting police officers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=55.34s)]
*  Birthright citizenship. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=57.58s)]
*  We live in unprecedented times right now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=58.9s)]
*  If you keep it moving from one thing to the next... [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=61.26s)]
*  So far so good. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=65.1s)]
*  Is this legal? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=66.82s)]
*  If you give it too many places it needs to look... [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=68.58s)]
*  You've never been deported before? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=70.62s)]
*  You've got to fill it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=71.98s)]
*  All at once. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=73.14s)]
*  All federal grants and loans will be halted. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=74.14s)]
*  Look, there is a purge happening. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=77.06s)]
*  Frankly, unprecedented in its nature. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=78.94s)]
*  Guantanamo. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=81.14s)]
*  DEI. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=82.14s)]
*  The Gulf of America. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=83.14s)]
*  No coherent opposition can really emerge. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=84.78s)]
*  It is hard to even think coherently. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=86.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's first two weeks in the White House have followed Bannon's strategy like [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=89.4s)]
*  a script. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  The flood is a point. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=95.08s)]
*  The overwhelm is a point. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  The message wasn't in any one executive order or announcement. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  It was in the cumulative effect of all of them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=102.6s)]
*  The sense that this is Trump's country now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=105.76s)]
*  It is his government now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=108.64s)]
*  It follows his will. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  It does what he wants. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  That he is limitless. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=113.08s)]
*  If he says that birthright citizenship is over, then it's over. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=115.52s)]
*  Or so he wants you to think. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=120.0s)]
*  In Trump's first term people said, don't normalize him. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=122.8s)]
*  In a second though, the task I think is a little bit clearer. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=125.82s)]
*  Don't believe him. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  Because Trump knows the power of marketing, the power of belief. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=131.44s)]
*  If you make people believe something is true, you make it likelier that it becomes true. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=135.12s)]
*  He clawed his way back to great wealth by playing a fearsome billionaire on TV. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  He remade himself as a winner after the 2020 election by refusing to admit he had ever lost. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  The American presidency is a limited office, but Trump has never wanted to be president. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=151.44s)]
*  What he's always wanted to be is king. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=156.64s)]
*  And his plan this time is to first play king on TV. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=160.16s)]
*  If we believe he is already king, if we believe he already has all that power, we will be [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  likelier to let him govern as a king. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=169.24s)]
*  We will then give him that power. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=171.84s)]
*  Don't believe him. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=174.4s)]
*  Trump has real powers, but they are the powers of the presidency. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=176.0s)]
*  The powers Joe Biden had. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=178.96s)]
*  The powers Barack Obama had. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=180.68s)]
*  The pardon power is vast and unrestricted, and so he could indeed pardon the January [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=182.36s)]
*  6 rioters. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=186.84s)]
*  Federal security protection is under the discretion of the executive branch. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=188.72s)]
*  And so yes, Trump could remove protection from Anthony Fauci and Mike Pompeo and John [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=192.28s)]
*  Bolton and Mark Milley and even Brian Hook, this largely unknown former State Department [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=198.52s)]
*  official who's under threat from Iran, who even donated time to Trump's transition team. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=204.56s)]
*  I would be very happy to put President Trump's record in the Middle East against any other president. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=210.04s)]
*  All of this, it was an act of astonishing cruelty and callousness. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=214.84s)]
*  This from a man who nearly died by an assassin's bullet months ago. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=218.96s)]
*  As much as anything ever has been this to me, this was an x-ray of the smallness of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=223.32s)]
*  Trump's soul. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=228.16s)]
*  But it was an act that was within his official power. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=229.76s)]
*  But the president cannot rewrite the Constitution. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=233.4s)]
*  Within days, his birthright citizenship order was frozen by a judge, by a Reagan appointee, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=236.48s)]
*  who told Trump's lawyers, I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar would [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=246.64s)]
*  It just boggles my mind. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=250.64s)]
*  Then a judge froze Trump's spending freeze. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=253.48s)]
*  He froze it even before it went into full effect. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=257.0s)]
*  And shortly thereafter, the Trump administration rescinded the entire order, in part to avoid [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=259.52s)]
*  a court case. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=263.96s)]
*  And it seemed pretty clear they would lose. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=264.96s)]
*  What Bannon wanted, what the Trump administration wants, is to keep everything moving fast. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=267.52s)]
*  Muzzle velocity. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  If you're always consumed by the next outrage, you can't look closely at the last one. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  The impression of Trump's power remains, and the fact that he keeps stepping on rakes [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=280.24s)]
*  is missed. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=284.4s)]
*  The projection of strength obscures the reality of weakness. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  Don't believe him. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  You can see this a few ways. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=291.52s)]
*  Is Trump playing a part? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=293.02s)]
*  Is he making a bet, or is he triggering a crisis? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=294.44s)]
*  Those I think are the options. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=297.32s)]
*  And I'm not certain that even he knows the answer. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=298.32s)]
*  Trump has always been an improviser. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=301.12s)]
*  But if you take it as a bet, a calculation, then here is a bet he's making. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=303.56s)]
*  Maybe this Supreme Court, stocked with his appointees, gives him powers no peacetime [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=308.2s)]
*  president has ever possessed. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=312.2s)]
*  Perhaps all this becomes legal now that he has asserted its legality. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  It's not impossible to imagine that bet paying off for him. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=319.56s)]
*  So what if the bet fails? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=322.76s)]
*  What if Trump's arrogations of power are soundly rejected by the courts? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=325.12s)]
*  Then comes the question of constitutional crisis. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  Does he just ignore the court's ruling? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  To do that would be to attempt a kind of coup. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=334.64s)]
*  I wonder if they have a stomach for that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=336.88s)]
*  The withdrawal of the OMB order to me suggests they don't. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=338.67999999999995s)]
*  Because bravado aside, Trump's political capital is thin. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=341.52s)]
*  Gallup is Trump's approval rating at 47%. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=346.4s)]
*  That is about 10 points beneath Joe Biden in January of 2021. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=349.64s)]
*  Both in his first and his second terms, he entered office with approval ratings below [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=354.17999999999995s)]
*  that of any other president in the modern era. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=357.41999999999996s)]
*  And so I thought these defenses of Trump's firings were telling. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=361.08s)]
*  It is the belief of this White House and the White House Counsel's Office that the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=365.04s)]
*  president was within his executive authority to do that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  The law says he's supposed to do 30 days notice. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  He didn't do that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=374.68s)]
*  Do you think he violated the law? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=375.68s)]
*  Well, technically, yeah. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=376.68s)]
*  Do you believe that it's legal? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  By definition, it's his administration. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=380.20000000000005s)]
*  They work for him at the pleasure of the president. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=381.8s)]
*  And if it's illegal, it should be legal. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  So then ask yourself, why isn't Trump trying to make it legal? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=386.88s)]
*  There is a reason Trump is doing all this through executive orders, right? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=390.54s)]
*  And he's submitting the same directives as legislation to pass through Congress. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=393.4s)]
*  A more powerful executive could convince Congress to eliminate the spending he opposes or to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=397.32s)]
*  reform the civil service to give him the powers of hiring and firing that he seeks. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=402.2s)]
*  And there's a good reason to do that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=406.52s)]
*  To write these changes into legislation would make them both more durable and would allow [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=409.2s)]
*  them to argue their merits in a more strategic way. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=413.28s)]
*  He would be reforming the entire system. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  But Republicans at the moment, they have only a three seat edge in the House, smallest majority [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=417.64s)]
*  since the Great Depression. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=422.6s)]
*  They have a 53 seat majority in the Senate. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=423.6s)]
*  Trump is obviously doing nothing to reach out to Democrats. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=426.76000000000005s)]
*  If Trump tried to pass this agenda's legislation, it would fail. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=430.04s)]
*  And that would make Trump look weak. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=433.8s)]
*  And Trump, Trump doesn't want to look weak. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=435.76000000000005s)]
*  He remembers John McCain humiliating him in his first term by casting the deciding vote [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=438.56s)]
*  against Obamacare appeal. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=442.32000000000005s)]
*  Congress is a place where you can lose. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=446.76000000000005s)]
*  And it's a tension at the heart of Trump's whole strategy. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=450.28s)]
*  Today I will sign a series of historic executive orders. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=453.35999999999996s)]
*  Trump is acting like a king because he's too weak to govern like a president. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=458.96s)]
*  With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=463.4s)]
*  of common sense. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=469.15999999999997s)]
*  This flurry of activity, it's meant to suggest the existence of a plan. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  But the closer you look, even at this first two weeks, the less true it seems. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=477.96s)]
*  They are scrambling and flailing already. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  They are leaking against each other in the press already. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=485.4s)]
*  We learned that the OMB directive was drafted, reportedly, without the input or oversight [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=488.52s)]
*  of key Trump officials. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=492.38s)]
*  It didn't go through the proper approval process, an administration official told the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  Washington Post. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=498.24s)]
*  For that to be the process and product of such a sweeping signature initiative in the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=499.85999999999996s)]
*  second week of a president's second term, it's embarrassing. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=505.76s)]
*  But it's not just a spending freeze. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=511.40000000000003s)]
*  The Trump administration is waging an immediate war on the bureaucracy, trying to replace [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=512.92s)]
*  the deep state they believe hampered them in the first term. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=516.84s)]
*  And a big part of this project seems to have been outsourced to Elon Musk, who is bringing [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=519.88s)]
*  the tactics he used to Twitter to the federal government. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=523.88s)]
*  We're about 20% of the original size. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=526.8s)]
*  So 80% left? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=529.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=531.12s)]
*  He is longtime aides now at the Office of Personnel Management. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=532.28s)]
*  And the email that got sent out to nearly all federal employees even reused the subject [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=535.96s)]
*  line of the email he sent out to Twitter employees after the acquisition. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=540.12s)]
*  A fork in the road. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=544.0s)]
*  It's a kind of bragging. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=545.88s)]
*  Elon wants you, he wants everybody to know it was him. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=548.72s)]
*  The email offered millions of civil servants a backdoor buyout, agreed to resign, and in [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=552.92s)]
*  theory, at least you can collect your paycheck and benefits until the end of September without [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=558.16s)]
*  doing any work. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=562.48s)]
*  The Washington Post reported that the email blindsided many of the Trump administration, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=564.24s)]
*  who would normally have consulted on a notice like that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=568.6s)]
*  It blindsided many of the people who are going to have to run these agencies that are now [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=571.12s)]
*  going to be dotted by resignations. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=575.04s)]
*  I suspect Musk thinks of the federal workforce as this huge mass of woke and largely useless [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=577.28s)]
*  ideologues. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=581.88s)]
*  For most federal workers, they have very little to do with politics. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=582.88s)]
*  About 16% of them work in health care. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=587.16s)]
*  These are nurses and doctors who work for the Veterans Affairs Department. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=589.92s)]
*  How many of them does Musk want to lose? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  How many primary care doctors treating veterans is he hoping take a buyout? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=596.4s)]
*  Twitter worked terribly after Musk's takeover. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=601.92s)]
*  It had these frequent outages and bugs, but its outages are not a national scandal. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  When VA health care degrades, it is a national scandal. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=610.9599999999999s)]
*  Most of what we're talking about here is a group text service at scale. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=614.32s)]
*  How many people are really needed for that? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=617.5600000000001s)]
*  What Trump wants you to see in all this activity is command. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=623.2800000000001s)]
*  What is really in all this activity is chaos. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=627.1600000000001s)]
*  They have convinced themselves that speed and force is a strategy unto itself, that [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=629.72s)]
*  it is in a sense a replacement for an actual strategy, for thinking and talking things [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=634.96s)]
*  through, for consultation, for planning things out. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=639.6s)]
*  I don't believe them. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=643.6s)]
*  I had a conversation a couple months ago with someone who knows how the federal government [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=644.6s)]
*  works about as well as anyone alive. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=648.44s)]
*  I asked him what would worry him most if he saw Trump doing it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=650.88s)]
*  What he said was he would worry most if Trump went slowly, if he began his term by doing [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  things that made him more popular, that made his opposition weaker and more confused, if [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=662.16s)]
*  he worked by stealth, if he tried to build strength for the midterms while slowly expanding [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=666.96s)]
*  his powers and chipping away at the state in the places where it was weakest, where [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=671.96s)]
*  people couldn't really see him doing it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=676.52s)]
*  But Trump didn't do any of that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=679.0s)]
*  Instead, muzzle velocity. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=681.32s)]
*  And so the opposition to Trump, which seems so listless and absent after the election, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=683.6s)]
*  now it's beginning to rouse itself. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=688.28s)]
*  There's a subreddit for federal employees where one of the top posts reads, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=690.88s)]
*  This non-buyout really seems to have backfired. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=694.4399999999999s)]
*  I'll be honest, before that email went out, I was looking for any way to get out of this [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=697.04s)]
*  fresh hell. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=700.56s)]
*  But now I'm fired up to make these goons as frustrated as possible. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=701.56s)]
*  As I write this, it's been upvoted more than 39,000 times. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=705.8s)]
*  And civil servant after civil servant is echoing the initial sentiment. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=710.0s)]
*  In Iowa this week, Democrats flipped a state Senate seat in a district that Trump had won [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=715.4799999999999s)]
*  easily in 2024. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=720.2399999999999s)]
*  The attempted spending freeze gave Democrats their voice back as they zeroed in on the [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=722.9599999999999s)]
*  popular programs Trump had imperiled. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=726.4799999999999s)]
*  Trump isn't building support here. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=729.52s)]
*  He's losing it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=731.16s)]
*  Trump isn't fracturing his opposition. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=732.52s)]
*  He's finally uniting it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=734.6s)]
*  This is the weakness of the strategy that Bannon proposed and that Trump is following. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=737.32s)]
*  It is a strategy that forces you into overreach. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=741.32s)]
*  To keep the zone flooded, you have to keep acting. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=744.96s)]
*  You have to keep moving. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=747.52s)]
*  You have to keep creating new cycles of outrage or fear to keep the media and the opposition [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=749.0s)]
*  overwhelmed. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  But then you overwhelm yourself. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=754.8000000000001s)]
*  They are flooding their own zone. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=756.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't know that Trump sees his own fork in the road coming. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=759.4399999999999s)]
*  He may believe he's a power he is claiming. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=763.04s)]
*  That would be a mistake on his part. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=765.24s)]
*  It would be a self-deception that could doom his presidency. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=766.5999999999999s)]
*  But the real threat is if he convinces the rest of us to believe he has power he does [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=769.9599999999999s)]
*  not have. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=774.64s)]
*  The first two weeks of his presidency have not shown his strength. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=776.16s)]
*  He is trying to overwhelm you. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=779.52s)]
*  He is trying to keep you off balance. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=782.0799999999999s)]
*  He is trying to convince you of something that isn't true. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=784.4s)]
*  Don't believe him. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s&t=788.04s)]
