# How to Discover Your Own Taste
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlIy-6sZmH4)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  I've been thinking a lot lately about why the internet isn't fun anymore.
*  And one of the hypotheses I've come to believe is that we moved at some point from this period
*  where the internet was about curation, it was about finding these individuals who would
*  welcome you into these worlds they had created and found and put together for you, to this
*  internet of algorithms.
*  And one of the quiet things that happened when that happened is that it became harder
*  to feel like you were finding individual experiences on the internet, and it became harder to
*  be an individual on the internet.
*  And because we live a lot of our lives on the internet, that means it also became harder
*  to be an individual.
*  And as this yearning for this digital life that I feel like I once had and no longer
*  do has grown, I've noticed myself in my own life seeking out people who are individuals,
*  and people more than that who seem to have their own sense of aesthetics, of style, of
*  taste.
*  These weren't things that were that important to me a decade ago, but they've become more
*  important to me now.
*  I've come to see them almost as a kind of superpower, both because just living a beautiful
*  life or living a life in which beauty has a central role feels more important to me
*  as I get older, but also because it feels increasingly like a kind of superpower, like
*  a kind of act of resistance against what these algorithms and what this age online is doing
*  to us.
*  It feels like being able to be attuned enough inside yourself to know what you really like,
*  not just what you're being fed, being attentive enough to the world around you to see things
*  that are really yours, not just everybody else's, feels like an important way to live.
*  And so I've been wanting to talk about this on the show, but it's a bit of a fuzzy thing
*  to talk about.
*  But Kyle Cheka, who is a staff writer at The New Yorker and got a lot of attention a couple
*  months back for this article, Why the Internet Isn't Fun Anymore, he's got a book coming
*  out on January 16th called Filter World, How Algorithms Flattened Culture.
*  And luckily for me, it's very much about this.
*  It's about how algorithms changed culture, changed what people who make culture are rewarded
*  for making, but also about this question of what is taste?
*  What is a sense of aesthetics?
*  And what happens to it when it collides with the homogenizing digital reality in which
*  we now live?
*  As always, my email, azraklanshow.nytimes.com.
*  Kyle Cheka, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  Let me just begin here.
*  What's taste?
*  Style or taste is like knowing who you are and knowing what you like, and then being
*  able to look outside of yourself, see the world around you, and then pick out the one
*  from around you that does resonate with you, that makes you feel like you are who you are
*  or that you can incorporate into your kind of mindset and worldview.
*  I mean, it's a process of collection almost, like you're grabbing onto the little voices
*  and artists and touchstones that make you who you are and give you your sense of self.
*  You're drawn to something without knowing why.
*  I often find myself a little turned off in books when we end up in a Voltaire quote too
*  early on.
*  It's just a kind of cliche, but I really liked the one here that you have.
*  And he writes, in order to have taste, it is not enough to see and to know what is beautiful
*  in a given work.
*  One must feel beauty and be moved by it.
*  Tell me what you take from that, why that quote spoke to you.
*  I think when we talk about taste today, it's often a very superficial idea.
*  We think that it just rests in what band you like, what books you read, what clothes you
*  wear.
*  But I liked going back to some of those philosophers.
*  They really thought of taste as a more fundamental human experience, like a moral capacity, a
*  way of judging what's around you and evaluating what's good and what's meaningful for you
*  and for your life.
*  I like to think about taste as something that's not just about consuming a thing or enjoying
*  something superficially on a day-to-day basis, but instead almost making it part of yourself.
*  I actually wish somebody had told me this long ago.
*  I think I used to understand taste as very external.
*  It was about knowing what other people think is good.
*  What does it mean to have good taste?
*  You have the same taste as people who have good taste.
*  It has a turtles all the way down quality.
*  I thought I could have good taste or bad taste, and I mostly thought I had bad taste.
*  I didn't really understand that there was my taste.
*  That's a weird thing to say as a 39-year-old, but it's relatively recent for me that I began
*  to realize the first question is, what do I actually like and why?
*  One of the experiences that kicked this off for me actually happened a little bit across
*  the show in the past couple of years where I really wanted to develop an appreciation
*  for classical music.
*  I really threw myself at it.
*  I talked to people, I read books, and I listened to the music.
*  It took a long time.
*  It was like 10 months of really pushing at this.
*  What worked for me was when I tripped almost accidentally into more modern, post-classical
*  music, like Steve Reich and Philip Glass and now Carolyn Shaw and Nico Muley and a bunch
*  of people like that, and some of the more modern experimental electronic work.
*  All of a sudden, I found something that I liked that nobody had given me that I just
*  found through work.
*  It wasn't that the other stuff was bad and this was good.
*  It's just that for a variety of reasons related to me, this created a reaction.
*  It created a very strong sense.
*  It's a piece of work by Peter Gregson and some co-musicians.
*  These set of quartets and one of them, it's like number two, Warmth, is I think the most
*  beautiful piece of music I've virtually ever heard.
*  And it's strange.
*  And not everybody who hears it feels what I do, but I feel what I do.
*  And I trust that feeling.
*  And truly, nobody had told me that was important.
*  Yeah, I think taste almost can move in two directions.
*  There is that internal sense of what am I feeling when I experience a work of art?
*  What is happening in my own brain, in my soul when I listen to this music?
*  And then there's this external idea of it, which is being super self-conscious about
*  what other people are consuming, how they're consuming it, how they might judge you for
*  your taste.
*  We don't want to be seen as having bad taste.
*  And that consciousness of how other people's taste works kind of occludes our own experience
*  of that internal pleasure or aesthetic joy.
*  I was talking to my editor Claire about this and she was making the point that it's very
*  hard to tell the difference between those two experiences.
*  When I am listening to something, how do I know that the reaction I'm having internally
*  is not the internalized reaction that I understand the world to have externally?
*  Right.
*  I mean, even as a teenager or something, you start to think about your own taste.
*  You start to be aware of what you like and don't like that's different from other people.
*  But there's also this huge pressure to conform.
*  And I think people really get pushed into that.
*  They either think they have to conform to having good taste or they kind of go the opposite
*  direction and say, this is not worth my time.
*  I don't want to worry about taste.
*  I don't want to think too much about what I like or don't like because that's frivolous
*  or pretentious.
*  And I think that kind of barricades us from having those beautiful experiences that you
*  described where a work of art that appears to you kind of in this zone of silence can
*  surprise you and shock you and move you and make you feel something that you haven't felt
*  before or didn't expect to feel.
*  You have a quote from Montesquieu who says, quote, natural taste is not a theoretical
*  knowledge.
*  It's a quick and exquisite application of rules which we do not even know.
*  I love it.
*  I love that quote so much because it's you don't know.
*  You don't know the thing that's going to hit for you.
*  There's like a system that you can sense.
*  There's like a framework that exists for you.
*  And yet you can still have that total sense of surprise.
*  And that's like the ineffability of taste.
*  That's fundamentally what's not data driven about it.
*  It's not just about what the most people engage with and how similar this person is to you.
*  It's purely just about like existing with something and feeling it.
*  So as I've been trying to shift my own style in ways that I think is entirely possible,
*  I will look back on in photos and be like, that was an embarrassing period for me.
*  One thing that weirdly I just react very strongly to are certain kinds of brightly patterned
*  sherpa jackets.
*  This is not necessarily what I think looks good on other people.
*  It is not what I imagine myself in.
*  When I imagine myself as a centerfold of my own life, I don't think this is the most stylish
*  in the sense of other people will be like, that guy looks great.
*  And yet somehow have a strong internal reaction to them.
*  There's something about the texture, the softness, the brightness.
*  It's more how I want to feel inside than reflected outside.
*  And it has been a complete surprise.
*  In that way, it makes myself feel less knowable to me.
*  Actually trying to listen to what moves me when I'm walking through a store or a shop
*  or for that matter, a museum or it's often a surprise.
*  I think that I have typically had an outside view on myself.
*  How would I look to someone else and try to attach to that?
*  And then trying to actually see what moves me.
*  It's like, well, who the hell is that?
*  Taste isn't a code that you can solve, I think.
*  It's not like manners, maybe like a book of rules that you can follow and conform to.
*  But instead it is that listening to yourself and knowing when something strikes you and
*  being aware to feel that and allow yourself to feel it.
*  In a museum, rather than looking at the names, I try to just look at the painting and be
*  like, oh, what is interesting in this bucolic landscape?
*  It's not about who made it or what the date was, but instead just about what is coming
*  out.
*  What is reaching from the artist to you and really hitting that note?
*  One of the motivations for this conversation for me is I just didn't ask me anything.
*  And I think that every one of these I've done in last year, I get this constant question,
*  which is, okay, I'm in college, it's a world of AI, or you have kids and they're going
*  to be growing up in the world of AI.
*  What do you think is more important now than it was?
*  I have this intuition that in a world where everybody has access to these models, what
*  they're going to do is create a lowest common denominator of aggregated taste.
*  Having a very specific sense of taste, having a very specific sense of discernment becomes
*  more important, that it becomes a real mark of distinction.
*  Because it's going to be so easy for people to skip that step in becoming their own human
*  being, it creates a higher premium on being a human, on being an individual, on offering
*  to the people in your life, offering in your work, offering in your contributions, something
*  specific.
*  And in many ways, one reason I think AI is so threatening is that we have asked people
*  for so long to not be very human, to actually be very generic, to act themselves like a
*  machine, to do something very rote, to do things that are non-creative.
*  I'm curious how you think about that, how you think about the returns to this, not just
*  monetary but also kind of psychic, as we move into this world where anybody can call up
*  any piece of culture and create it instantly as long as it is highly derivative.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, the generic human is like the ideal consumer in capitalism.
*  It's the ideal worker in industrialization.
*  The person who has no desires that are not the desires of everyone else.
*  And I feel like that's dystopian, for one thing.
*  That is a very poor motivation for living, maybe.
*  I think having taste seems more important than ever, or cultivating your own taste.
*  Because you are surrounded by so many options and because it's so easy to be passively
*  fed whatever you're looking for, taste is always a way of carving out a distinction
*  for yourself and figuring out who you are.
*  And I think that's more important when algorithmic feeds try to tell you who you are all the
*  time.
*  So I think in order to have independent opinions, in order to exercise that ability to make
*  a judgment or evaluate a piece of culture, you're kind of going to have to develop a
*  sense of taste and you're going to have to get out of some of these very passive roots
*  of consumption.
*  I mean, if you want to think about politics or art or anything for yourself, you can't
*  just ask Chad GPT to tell you what to think.
*  Tell me about the coffee shops.
*  The generic coffee shop, I think, has become kind of like my Moby Dick.
*  It's this aesthetic puzzle or problem that I kind of became aware of in the mid 2010s,
*  maybe circa 2014, 2015.
*  And it was just this strange, uncanny experience I was having that as I traveled around the
*  world as a journalist, like doing these freelance magazine assignments.
*  I would land in a particular city, whether that was like Tokyo or L.A. or Berlin or Beijing.
*  And I always managed to find a particular style of coffee shop.
*  Like it was this minimalist box of a cafe with white subway tiles on the walls and mid
*  century Scandinavian furniture and handmade ceramic mugs with nice cappuccinos in them.
*  And the weird part of it was to me that this was not like the work of a parent company.
*  It wasn't a Starbucks.
*  It wasn't like a global chain.
*  Instead, it was all of these completely independent coffee shops, baristas, entrepreneurs, whatever,
*  who had decided to kind of mold themselves into the same aesthetic and the same format
*  of space, independently of each other.
*  So as I was experiencing these coffee shops and kind of finding them in whatever city
*  I was in, I started wondering why they were so generic or why, what connected them altogether.
*  And my conclusion was that the kind of nascent digital platforms that I was using, whether
*  Instagram or Yelp or Google Maps, were kind of feeding this series of cafes to me as a
*  recommendation.
*  Like my taste was being evaluated.
*  And then I was getting recommended the same minimalist cafe over and over again.
*  And I was kind of being driven to these places by the platforms themselves.
*  I buy that.
*  But also it was being fed back to the people creating the coffee shops.
*  You have, I think, a very provocative line in that section of your book where you talk
*  about, and I've been to these coffee shops.
*  I was just in a bunch of these coffee shops in Tokyo.
*  I was in them in Mexico City not too long before that.
*  And I love them.
*  I seek them out.
*  But it's also they're there for me to seek out.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  They exist.
*  Often they sell themselves as very local.
*  And I think they are self understood by their creators as very local.
*  And there's one way of thinking about that as a sham.
*  They're not local.
*  These are kind of generic international coffee shops.
*  But you write that they are, quote, authentically connected to the new network of digital geography,
*  which I thought was a really interesting way to put that.
*  Can you unpack that for me?
*  They were locally.
*  They were authentically connected to something.
*  But it wasn't to the geography of the place.
*  It wasn't to the realities of Mexico City or the aesthetics of Chinese culture in Beijing.
*  What they were really connected to was our culture that we've developed on the internet.
*  So we feel this authentic connection.
*  We feel they're connected to our identities and our preferences.
*  But I think the preferences that they connect to are the ones that we have developed online
*  that come through platforms like Instagram or Yelp or Google Maps.
*  This was a very eerie experience for me in Mexico City.
*  And I love Mexico City.
*  I absolutely love that place.
*  And I was there about a year and some change ago.
*  And in this part of the trip, I was in Roma and Condesa, which are pretty internationally
*  heavy areas of that city.
*  And I couldn't get over how attuned to me the aesthetics were.
*  I came from San Francisco at that point.
*  And it had distilled the aesthetic of the Bessings in San Francisco to me.
*  And it was this weird, disorienting situation where in a way what was so appealing to me
*  about Mexico City was how unbelievably familiar it was.
*  It was a little bit different.
*  And obviously there are many places I went that were quite different.
*  But in the places I was staying, it was like the soul of Instagram had come to life, the
*  soul of my part of Instagram.
*  And I began noticing that then when I did other travels.
*  And that ability to have much more familiarity actually as a traveler going around the world
*  can be kind of wonderful.
*  To go back to this question of how to even figure out what you like, it takes away that
*  capacity or it makes it much more difficult to find that different, that contrast, that
*  confrontation with new experience and aesthetic that helps you discover new things that you like.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I think the problem with this ecosystem that we've developed, like being surrounded
*  by algorithmic recommendations, is that it prevents us from being challenged and surprised
*  a lot of the time.
*  Everything is molded to our preferences that we've already expressed.
*  The Spotify recommendations kind of follow all the bands and genres that you already,
*  that they know you like, that you engage with.
*  Where we're kind of herded and shepherded toward experiences that we're going to find
*  comfortable enough, familiar enough, with just enough of the local flavor to make them
*  not utterly boring and generic.
*  I don't want to argue that this is a completely new experience.
*  This has existed for millennia.
*  This is why chains are popular.
*  Yes.
*  Like, comfort is a product that people like to consume.
*  It's scalable.
*  Consumers enjoy it.
*  In the book, I reference this 19th century commentator in France, I think, who was complaining
*  about how train travel suddenly meant that all cities were becoming more similar than
*  different.
*  So I think it's a common complaint, but we live in such an accelerated version of that,
*  I think we can see our tastes reflected in so many more places and in such a granular
*  level like the coffee shops in Mexico City, where you love to see like, I don't know,
*  they serve tacos or there's some local braided textiles on the wall, but there's still that
*  fundamental homogeneity where you have the subway tile and the furniture and like the
*  menu is familiar to you.
*  I'll say this goes in all directions.
*  The coffee shop I typically go to here in Brooklyn also serves me tacos.
*  And also it looks a lot like the coffee shops in Mexico City.
*  I mean, it does go in both ways.
*  Blue Bottle is heavily inspired by Tokyo coffee shop, then goes back to Tokyo and becomes
*  a popular coffee shop at the beginning.
*  It's very recursive in that way.
*  Self-reinforcing, it's a kind of vicious cycle.
*  And I think, I mean, digital platforms have connected so many people around the world.
*  Billions of people kind of circulate through the same ecosystems online.
*  And I kind of think there's this vast generic agglomeration of stuff that we're just cherry
*  picking from each place that we like and molding it into like a great blob of generic culture.
*  I want to dig into different ways that algorithms are changing tastes, which is the central
*  concern of the book.
*  And one of the ways is in a preference for quantified mass appeal as opposed to particularistic
*  appeal.
*  And what I mean by that is that the way I knew about movies when I was younger is the
*  LA Times had a movie critic.
*  And that person had their taste, right?
*  Presumably good taste, but their taste.
*  And they like some things and they like other things.
*  And over time, I began to learn about critics who I liked and critics who I didn't.
*  But now I'm much more likely to just go and look at the summary judgment of Rotten Tomatoes,
*  of Metacritic.
*  When algorithms are feeding me things, they're doing something kind of like that, right?
*  Where they are looking at people a little bit more personalized, looking at people like
*  me who seem to do things like what I do and then telling me if other people like me liked
*  the thing.
*  But we moved away from this attaching to a curator who has an individual taste and kind
*  of guides you through the world in that specific way and move towards the averaging out of
*  curators.
*  Like it's a poll, right?
*  Like we treat everything as a poll and not as criticism.
*  And that felt very efficient to me for a while and now feels very weird.
*  I think we all did get bored of it.
*  Like over the 2010s, culture became more datafied or driven by this engagement information that
*  was only possible through digital platforms.
*  So suddenly, Twitter could count how many people were interacting with the tweet.
*  Netflix could surveil how many people in real time were watching what movie, what TV show.
*  Spotify very visibly can tell what song is becoming popular off of an album and kind
*  of promote that above all else.
*  There have always been metrics like the Nielsen ratings or box office numbers or whatever.
*  But there's never before been that kind of like tyranny of real time data, which kind
*  of outweighs the opinion of the critic and of the individual human who might tell you
*  what you might like.
*  So I think there was a shift from human tastemakers and human gatekeepers to this very data driven
*  system in which only what is popular gets more popular and what does not get that engagement,
*  get that immediate attention is kind of pushed into the shadows, pushed into silence and
*  cannot become mainstream, cannot reach more people.
*  So one thing you argue in the book is that the algorithmic world privileges sameness.
*  It pushes everything in the direction of what people already like, in the direction of the
*  in the direction of kind of mass engagement, but low disruption.
*  And I couldn't figure out if I actually thought that was true because at the same time, you
*  know, when I compare now to the nineties, which is when I grew up, you know, when I
*  sort of first became aware of a lot of culture, I think the ability to find niches of everything,
*  anime, weird anime, every kind of music you could possibly imagine, hyper pop, all kinds
*  of hip hop, every sub genre of electronica, you get really into jungle now.
*  That was hard then.
*  You know, when I even think of politics, there's this incredible fracturing of ideologies,
*  right?
*  What has worked in politics online?
*  The algorithm doesn't want sameness, it wants high engagement.
*  And you get that from in many ways disruptive ideologies, right?
*  The rise of Black Lives Matter, the rise of Red Rose Twitter, on the right, the alt
*  right, on the right, Donald Trump, on the right, neo reactionaries.
*  So there is this way in which it doesn't feel to me that the algorithms have created more
*  monoculture.
*  It does push you in a direction.
*  But there are more directions now than ever.
*  I mean, I don't know how I would find a bunch of the music I find now.
*  I'm curious about that tension for you, because the idea that we're moving towards sameness
*  is a big theme of the book.
*  But I look around and I see, you know, many ways like more difference and more fracturing
*  in the culture than ever.
*  Yeah, I think there is a tension to it.
*  And I think algorithms kind of go in two directions to me, like either they're seeking engagement.
*  So in one direction, to provoke a very strong reaction is one form of engagement.
*  And that might be the political triggering of one movement or another.
*  The different form of engagement is this kind of mass passive engagement, where people are
*  kind of like funneled toward an aesthetic or a mode that works for the most people at
*  once.
*  So I think both of those things happen at the same time.
*  And I think the internet makes everything available.
*  And I think that's completely amazing.
*  Like I remember finding those obscure anime shows or whatever on BitTorrent in the early
*  2000s.
*  And that completely changed my life as a cultural consumer, helped me build my own taste.
*  But I think experiences like that are not the default now.
*  Like I think we have so many possibilities, we can find whatever we're looking for.
*  The overall ecosystem of streaming and of algorithmic recommendations does have a way
*  of funneling us just toward particular areas of that body of culture if we're not very
*  actively fighting it.
*  What kinds of art does that end up promoting within culture?
*  And what kinds does it push to the margins?
*  I mean, what's the example of a movie that was really helped by the sort of critical
*  space and is hurt by the Rotten Tomatoes system and vice versa?
*  What's something that really works in the Rotten Tomatoes world, but maybe wouldn't
*  work as well in the world of individual critics?
*  Yeah, I mean, my sense is that what functions well in that Rotten Tomatoes ecosystem, where
*  when the most people approve something is when it's the best, is a kind of like Marvel
*  end game where a piece of culture is ruthlessly optimized to appeal to the largest number
*  of people, whether it's to the committed hardcore fan who wants to check every box
*  and figure out every element of the canon that's being constructed to the totally ambient
*  distracted viewer who will just sit there and marvel at the explosions and the CGI.
*  The kind of culture that the algorithmic ecosystem ends up promoting is that widest
*  possible average.
*  It's the stuff that avoids alienating people, keeps you engaged as much as possible, even
*  if that engagement is very shallow.
*  It's fundamentally scalable, to use the horrible Silicon Valley word.
*  Whereas I think historically, the culture that we prize the most is usually not that.
*  It's usually the stuff that is not popular but grows in popularity over time.
*  It's the stuff you have to be patient with to let grow within you.
*  It's easy to think this didn't happen now, but Moby Dick barely sold in Herman Melville's
*  lifetime and only became this iconic work of literature over a century.
*  That work of art was not determined by popularity or engagement metrics.
*  It was determined by slow word of mouth over decades and decades and generations.
*  I'm always surprised when I look back on the books that mean a lot to me, because that's
*  the space where I consume the most.
*  How much the books that I am thinking about a year later are often not ones I really liked.
*  They're often not even ones I would really recommend.
*  They're ones I had to struggle with.
*  Something in that struggle meant something to me or helped me with something or just
*  has continued setting off a struggle in me.
*  But if you ask me to give it a one to ten, I wouldn't even really know where to put it.
*  Maybe not a great book, but it has one really great idea or I actually think this book is
*  wrong but it forced a useful conflict in me.
*  It does seem to me like that is harder and harder to find.
*  This is I think one of the points of the filters and the algorithms that the more it's harder
*  to find the less of it will actually be made.
*  You said a word a minute ago, ambient.
*  One of the points you make in the book is that you feel a culture in general is becoming
*  more ambient.
*  That one thing that is being selected for is culture that can be consumed ambiently.
*  What do you mean by that?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean I really take it from the musician Brian Eno and I think his core meaning of
*  ambient was any kind of art that's, I think I can quote him, as ignorable as it is interesting.
*  It's like a thing that you can either choose to engage with or kind of let play in the
*  background and it works equally in both circumstances.
*  And I really like the story of how he came up with us.
*  He had been in a car accident I think or got hit by a taxi and he was laid up in bed at
*  home.
*  Then a friend came and visited him, gave him an album I think of harp compositions or something
*  on vinyl.
*  And the friend was like, oh, Brian, I'll put it on the record player.
*  Don't get up.
*  Don't hurt yourself.
*  But the friend didn't turn the volume up.
*  And so Brian Eno was sitting there lying in bed trapped while the record player was just
*  playing very quietly.
*  But he had this epiphany that, oh, the music can function just as well even if I can barely
*  hear it.
*  And I think he used that insight to make great music like Music for Airports that intentionally
*  did that.
*  But now we have so much content that's not the intentional aesthetic choice.
*  It's kind of how everything has to be in order to move through these systems where engagement
*  is the primary metric.
*  Music for Airports is amazing.
*  If people haven't heard that, they should listen to that album.
*  It holds up.
*  I got really into it again two years ago.
*  I love that album.
*  But I feel like a lot of the work that comes under this Monaco Now does not benefit from
*  being paid attention to.
*  Right?
*  I mean, we now all have earbuds or AirPod Maxes or whatever in our ears.
*  There's speakers everywhere we go.
*  You have televisions in your home.
*  You have televisions at the bar.
*  There's the capacity for culture to be always on.
*  The capacity to be always listening.
*  It would have been very expensive for every store to play music 75 years ago.
*  Like you need a person with a piano at all times.
*  But now you have speakers all the time.
*  That's interesting to me.
*  That changes the kinds of things we need.
*  I find I use a lot of music not to listen to music, but to regulate my own mood.
*  That's what it's really doing.
*  It is settling my nervous system at the end of the day.
*  It is amping it up before a workout.
*  The music is not the point.
*  My heart rate is the point.
*  It's just functional art, basically.
*  But I couldn't do that before.
*  I just would have had to be ... I don't know.
*  Whatever was going on around me was going around me.
*  Now you have these personalized culture scapes at almost all times.
*  Personalized culture scapes is great.
*  That should be the new thing.
*  I think a lot about how we live in this very opt-in reality.
*  You can think about noise-canceling headphones that you see on every airplane and train all
*  the time.
*  Or you can think about looking at your phone as you're walking around or playing a podcast
*  or whatever.
*  I think that necessitates ambience almost because there's always a background against
*  which you can experience something else.
*  You want to be able to constantly toggle between paying attention to something and not paying
*  attention to it.
*  When you're thinking about the ability to attune to what these experiences are really
*  doing to you, there's just a tremendous amount of distraction, of noise.
*  I notice that I'm much more able to discern my own reactions to writing when I'm reading
*  on paper.
*  Just because there's nothing really or it is more difficult to distract myself from
*  what is happening inside of me, to the extent taste is a kind of attunement to yourself,
*  in developing taste in a space where it is harder to attune to yourself, where yourself
*  is more drowned out and it's easier to jump away from that internal experience, that is
*  also going to degrade, it seems to me at least, the fundamental ground on which that facility
*  is developed.
*  Yeah.
*  I think these ecosystems and platforms kind of prevent us from experiencing difficult
*  content in a healthy way.
*  We don't have to fight through something.
*  We don't have to be patient.
*  We don't have to think so much about what something is doing to us or consider our own
*  opinion as it develops because we always have that possibility of clicking away and flipping
*  to the next video on TikTok.
*  It's almost like boredom doesn't exist, difficulty doesn't exist, scarcity doesn't exist.
*  I think a feeling I've been having a lot lately is that scarcity is often what creates
*  meaning.
*  When you're surrounded by infinite possibilities, when you know around the next corner is another
*  video that might be funnier or more to your liking, you're never going to sit with the
*  thing that's in front of you.
*  You're never going to be forced to have the patience or the fortitude maybe or the kind
*  of willpower to fight through something and figure out if you truly like it or not.
*  Whereas I think fighting that generic quality and figuring out at least one thing that brings
*  you joy and you're passionate about and that makes that change happen in your brain, makes
*  you have this encounter that you never expected, that's the only thing that's worth doing
*  in life kind of, or at least in the field of culture.
*  Why would you want to have the generic experience?
*  Why would you want the lowest common denominator results of recommendation?
*  A couple years ago there was a lot of discourse coverage about what the purpose of movie theaters
*  was.
*  I feel like this got to a kind of fever pitch in the pandemic because now you can buy, and
*  most people of means have bought, these very big TVs.
*  They hang in your house, you have the streaming platforms, so you have functionally the entire
*  library of human video content up until six months ago at your fingertips.
*  What did you need a movie theater for anymore?
*  There was real evidence that people were going to movies less.
*  I found personally that I need it much more, so I went over the weekend by myself, which
*  is my favorite way to go to the movies because I'm not then in the field of anybody else's
*  experience of it.
*  I went and saw the new Studio Ghibli movie, The Boy and the Heron, which is amazing and
*  beautiful but also strange and dreamlike and has periods where how one thing is connecting
*  to the other and not entirely clear.
*  If I were watching that at home, it would be very hard not to pull out my phone at that
*  moment and either look up what's going on or just as my attention is being repelled
*  a little bit.
*  Kind of lose attention, go wander off and do something else, go kind of focus on something
*  else and the experience of being in the theater is an experience of forcing a concentrated
*  attention which every time I do it and I don't get to do it as often as I would like, but
*  every time I do it, it's just a dramatically different experience.
*  It's not really about the size of the screen, it's about the darkness of the room and the
*  absence of anything else in it.
*  The sensory deprivation.
*  Yeah, I go to the movies for sensory deprivation so I can have that experience with the art
*  and that feels to me like a big question right now.
*  It's again, it's a thing I said this before on the show but I always worry about for my
*  kids is what kinds of attention are furnished online and what kinds are not?
*  What kinds of experiences can you have with culture in such an attentionally degraded
*  space and which kinds can you not?
*  I mean most of the encounters we have with culture online are pretty bad, I think.
*  We do have much more choice in what we consume and all these other possibilities surround
*  us but what we lack is that kind of museum-like experience or movie theater-like experience
*  where you do have to sit with something and think about it and kind of puzzle your way
*  through it without flipping to get an answer.
*  We have so little patience for difficulty and incomprehension that artists and other
*  creators too don't offer it to us.
*  They want to give us the answers right away.
*  They want to beat you to looking at Wikipedia by just telling you what's going to happen
*  and what to think about it and I just find that like a poorer version of culture than
*  other examples we've had before.
*  The writer Cory Doctorow, sci-fi writer, technology critic, has this concept of enshitification
*  where platforms begin by adding a lot of value to you, the user.
*  Early Google was magic.
*  Early Spotify was a kind of magic.
*  Over time as they need to pay back their VCs, that was not as big a deal for Google but
*  is a deal for others, as they just need to make more money, as they need to increase
*  their share price, they begin extracting value from the user.
*  That value is usually your attention, sometimes it's what you actually buy and you can feel
*  that happening in a lot of these places and I think that's one reason the internet feels
*  so crappy to a lot of us now.
*  I've written a lot about this but the enshitification process has simply advanced sufficiently in
*  enough of the major platforms that when I do a Google search, it is so clear that that
*  search is for the advertisers, right?
*  They are giving me so much advertising and so much of it is SEO crap that it no longer
*  feels like it is working for me.
*  I have really felt this in the past two years on Spotify, which is a complicated platform
*  in a lot of ways because I'm such an obsessive listener and listen so much and so weirdly,
*  it's not that it's perfect but it takes me in new directions and unusual directions all
*  the time.
*  It has learned enough about me that it is better at recommending music to me than any
*  friend I have really is.
*  So I kind of really appreciate the Spotify algorithm.
*  It's done me a lot of good.
*  I felt like that beautiful music I mentioned earlier, Warmth, I got it through Spotify.
*  They handed me that on vinyl.
*  But man, the degree to which it is now endlessly serving me, audiobooks that I don't listen
*  to there and podcasts that I don't want and just trying to get me to do things on the
*  platform that I don't want to do is really degrading my experience and I wonder how long
*  I'll end up on Spotify at this point.
*  I do think there is this way in which I would love the thing where I can kind of pay for
*  the algorithm I want.
*  And it does feel like we've backed into an internet now that is corroding.
*  And I wonder how long that is actually sustainable for.
*  It's hard and it's frustrating and you're a little bit locked in because you've built
*  a million playlists and you're used to it.
*  But I can't remember a time when it feels like everybody on the internet wants alternatives
*  as much as they currently do.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think we've hit this breaking point with how these platforms work and with how
*  the internet functions.
*  I mean, in part, I think it's over optimization to algorithms.
*  We've lived with these algorithmic recommendations for a long time now.
*  We've lived with Google search.
*  And so people who want to game that system are gaming the system.
*  And there's a tipping point at which too much optimization destroys the system where
*  we no longer get the kind of authentic results that we're looking for in Google or we can't
*  work through Spotify to find what we want.
*  That is bad as a user of technology.
*  It's also really bad as a consumer of culture.
*  Like I want to know where to find the like 18 jazz albums I've saved.
*  It's funny.
*  I think so much of the best of crypto culture was responsive or trying to imagine a response
*  to the set of problems.
*  Things you would truly own, things that were truly portable and interoperable.
*  And it ended up embedded in, I think, a very corrupt money making culture.
*  You're trying to solve the problems of capitalism with a technology built to create hyper capitalism,
*  the problems of financialization with hyper financialization.
*  And I don't think it was able and still has not been able yet to resolve that core contradiction.
*  But one reason the culture resonated for a lot of people in an authentic, sincere way
*  was that this has gone bad.
*  There's a bit of a parlor game I find in like, when did the internet go bad?
*  Like, when did this all go wrong?
*  But you identify something that has been on my mind because you have a whole chapter on
*  curation.
*  And in the internet that I came up in, the internet of blogs, of very early social media,
*  curation was such an important word.
*  I mean, that's what early bloggers and particularly the nodes of the blogosphere like Atrios and
*  InstaPundit and Andrew Sullivan were.
*  They were curators of interesting links.
*  There are other places too, Kotky, Drudge is a curator.
*  These were all curation operations done by human beings or sets of human beings.
*  And early social media, like you would attach to people websites, right?
*  Just people had these weird websites where they put up things they liked on them.
*  Tumblr was very curatorial.
*  And that all got eaten by algorithms.
*  And I do think there's something there.
*  I miss curators.
*  There are a couple of newsletters that have a curatorial function now for me.
*  But it's hard to find a human being exposing you to their taste.
*  And it's something I really appreciate now when I find it.
*  What I like about the internet is connecting with actual human beings and the sort of inability
*  to find them now and hold to them feels like a real wrong turn.
*  That was the promise of the internet for so long was that you could find someone really
*  you wouldn't have found in the traditional ecosystem of Hollywood or newspapers.
*  You could find a person like you personally who would be a voice that you could listen
*  to and follow and develop and grow alongside.
*  And I feel like how algorithmic feeds have ruined that is we don't know who we're going
*  to see so much anymore.
*  We can't be sure that we're listening to the same set of people or hearing the same
*  niche voice that we really wanted to follow.
*  Prior to Elon Musk's acquisition, Twitter was one of the less algorithmic platforms
*  still around in social media.
*  And I felt like I still had that ability to follow cool curators even if they were tiny
*  accounts with a thousand followers.
*  I knew they would pop up in my feed when they found something cool.
*  And now I just feel like that's been kind of erased in the flood of for you feeds where
*  I can't really tell who I'm getting or why anymore.
*  But they won't pop up.
*  This is a thing that frustrates me for a while.
*  That is now going back a couple of years.
*  I've been off Twitter X for a long time.
*  But I used to read it or try to read it like I read blogs.
*  I bookmarked a bunch of people's individual pages and that would just read in reverse
*  chronological order because the frustrating thing in this was that when I found somebody
*  I liked, what I wanted was not simply the things they said or pointed to that everybody
*  else liked too.
*  I wanted their weirder taste.
*  And their weirder taste was the thing I can never be assured of getting.
*  You said a second ago that it'll pop up if they find something cool.
*  It will if they find something other people think is cool.
*  But if they found something that was huh, if they found something that was like I'm
*  not so sure about that, I don't know what I think of that.
*  If they found something complicated, I wouldn't see it unless I sought it out.
*  Which blogging had that quality.
*  Websites had that quality.
*  I think a lot about the difference between what in my head is like the push internet
*  and the pull internet, right?
*  Which is not perfect language.
*  But the internet where things are pushed at you and the internet where you have to do
*  some work day after day going to visit a homepage, whatever, you have to pull it towards you.
*  And the problem with the push internet is it's not really under your control, right?
*  It's about what the force pushing is doing.
*  But as that became bigger, people stopped doing the things that allowed the pull internet
*  to exist.
*  There aren't so many blogs anymore.
*  Not none, but there are fewer.
*  People put their effort because it's the easier way to find audience and eventually to make
*  a living into the algorithmic spaces.
*  And so there's simply less of this other thing there to explore.
*  Yeah, there's less incentive, I think.
*  The incentives have changed.
*  The monetization strategies have changed.
*  I miss that pull internet.
*  I miss the incentive of finding weird or complicated things.
*  We had RSS feeds.
*  Now I think we have newsletters, which is a relatively unmediated form of consuming
*  someone's stuff.
*  And I feel like that's right now, at least, where I follow the weirdest voices or get
*  the complicated ideas to the point that sometimes they're too complicated.
*  I'm not reading your 8,000-word substack on why you're moving to Portugal or whatever.
*  I wonder about this underlying idea of curation.
*  You talk in the book about curation as a more complex and valuable practice than what
*  it became, which is simply some person or force has chosen things.
*  Tell me a bit about what curation means to you.
*  The term itself has become very devalued, I think.
*  Everything on Earth is curated at this point.
*  But in the book, I liked going back through that term's history.
*  The idea of a curator was not just someone who selected things.
*  Going back to ancient Rome, it was a kind of civic leader who took responsibility for
*  things like the aqueducts or public games.
*  And then it became a kind of religious function, where the curate of a church was someone who
*  took responsibility for the souls of the parishioners.
*  And there's that nice idea of responsibility and trust and an ongoing relationship in the
*  idea of a curator that I think gets lost.
*  In the 20th century, it became a word for people who run museums and stage exhibitions.
*  And even in that role, there's this way in which the curator, their job is to develop
*  a coherent body of objects.
*  Their job is to make people understand things in a deeper, complicated way that they wouldn't
*  be able to otherwise.
*  And when we say curator right now, on Instagram, for example, I just don't think it has that
*  same connotation of caretaking and responsibility.
*  So I think when I think about the value of curation, it's not just telling you what
*  to consume.
*  Just giving you this holistic education and insight into how things work, into the context
*  of objects or ideas.
*  It involves vast amounts of labor and time and work to present objects or ideas or songs
*  or whatever in the context that they deserve.
*  And I feel like that's been lost on the contemporary internet.
*  I think you can be on Instagram, you can be on TikTok, you can use chat GPT.
*  But what you have to do is go to the next deeper level of whatever you're looking at.
*  If you are getting into EDM on Spotify, fantastic.
*  Write down the albums you like.
*  Google the artists who you like.
*  Read about their biographies.
*  Maybe follow them on Instagram.
*  Maybe see what else they're thinking about and reading and who they're listening to.
*  Or if you like an author, read who they're reading and follow the web of connections
*  that they build.
*  And I feel like one connection that I followed in that way was with this anime that I pirated
*  when I was a teenager called Hibane Renme, which was by Yoshitoshi Abe, who's this brilliant
*  writer and artist.
*  But this was a very strange anime that I found completely inexplicable when I was a kid about
*  these winged angels in this strange bucolic walled city.
*  It was just this very melancholic, eerie television series.
*  And much later, like a decade or more later, when I was in my late 20s instead of 13 years
*  old, I discovered that that anime was based on a Haruki Murakami novel called Hard Boiled
*  Wonderland and the End of the World.
*  And I had read the novel and I liked Murakami and I liked the anime, but I had never put
*  the two together.
*  And it made me realize how these things are interconnected, but also made me realize something
*  about my own taste.
*  Because I found the same thing compelling.
*  I found the anime compelling as a teenager and I found the novel compelling as an adult.
*  And they kind of stemmed from the same aesthetic choices and the same mood.
*  And something about this elegy, mysterious, surreal mood is part of my taste as a consumer.
*  The moment that I realized that, I think it was a kind of epiphany about how culture works.
*  This is how culture works.
*  One novel or piece of art or piece of music creates more.
*  And there's this flowing web of inspiration and influence.
*  And that human-to-human connection is how great stuff gets made.
*  I had a funny experience over the past couple years where now he's huge, but I discovered
*  this electronic music producer, Fredigan, on the early side.
*  And really, really liked it, these looping samples over dance music.
*  And then really liked a bunch of his sets and then really liked his piano work.
*  And then his NPR Tiny Desk, which came out over the last year, was absolutely amazing.
*  But the thing that was interesting, because he blew up huge, I'm like, oh, I just like
*  this big mainstream dance producer, was it turns out he's a protege of Brian Eno.
*  Eno, in turn, is super influenced by Philip Glass and Steve Reich, who are the sort of
*  like minimalist pioneers.
*  And there are others too.
*  They're not the only ones, of course, who I really love.
*  And so it actually turned out the reason I like Fredigan is that it's actually a dance
*  version of the minimalist composers that I had fallen in love with like two or three
*  years ago, or maybe a little bit more than that now.
*  And that was just very surprising to me.
*  I hadn't heard it until a friend I'd sent the NPR Tiny Desk to was like, oh, this just
*  sounds like Steve Reich.
*  Contemporary Steve Reich.
*  Contemporary Steve Reich.
*  He's like, oh, you're completely right.
*  And then when I looked into it, sure enough, there were all the influences.
*  And that made the whole thing a lot richer to me.
*  Yeah, it tells you something about yourself.
*  It gives you a deeper appreciation of the influences and understanding of where the
*  music comes from.
*  And I think that's how artists work too.
*  They riff on people's work who they find inspiring.
*  They take parts of it and use it in new ways.
*  And that continuity.
*  There's a way in which you could be like, oh, Fredigan is just minimalist composition,
*  but with dance music.
*  It's like, no, that's cool.
*  It's good that that one element of something in the past has been recontextualized and
*  remade into something that hits us in a new way today.
*  That's cool.
*  That's fun to understand.
*  There's a satisfaction in discovering your own taste and the things you like and the
*  things that connect.
*  I mean, it's fun.
*  It's one of the few adventures left on the internet.
*  Yes.
*  And as a cultural consumer, to get off the beaten path and find something different gives
*  you an experience that you can't otherwise have.
*  I mean, my gut instinct is that the pretentiousness of taste is in part because it was a leisure
*  activity like in the 18th, 19th century, like knowing your own taste was something you could
*  do if you were an aristocrat, essentially.
*  But I think it's great that we all have that opportunity.
*  We can all access so much more culture.
*  We have the privilege and the ability to hunt these things down and become connoisseurs,
*  which like that word connoisseur comes from early art history and was like about amateur
*  art collectors who kind of looked so deeply at objects and sculptures that they came to
*  understand them in a different way than people had in the past.
*  I think that's such an interesting point that possibly some of the relationship between
*  snobbishness and taste and class and taste is that culture was very expensive to consume.
*  To see a lot of music meant going to the symphony a lot.
*  To see a lot of art meant traveling to museums or being able to own it.
*  I mean, there's a time when books were very expensive.
*  Movies were not a cheap thing.
*  You couldn't watch an unlimited number of them at home.
*  I mean, that is something that democratized, right?
*  The ability to experience it.
*  I find this to be a kind of anxiety of algorithms for me, which I find both useful and unpleasant,
*  which is the sense when I know I am watching or listening to something that's kind of crummy
*  that the best of the work humanity has ever produced is at my fingertips.
*  I shouldn't be wasting time.
*  And on the other hand, that sometimes makes it hard to just focus on the thing I'm with
*  and let that wash over me because is it crumby or do I just not have I just not given it
*  a chance?
*  Why am I not consuming the best of what humanity has to offer at every moment?
*  But it's also not a competition to always consume the best stuff.
*  I feel like there's a way in which algorithmic feeds have created a culture of optimization
*  where we think we always need to be consuming the best or most effective or most powerful
*  stuff.
*  When really, I think, as long as we're encountering something authentically or thinking about
*  it, everything is valuable to consume.
*  The random niche weird ambient track might give you something that the best Steve Reich
*  composition or whatever doesn't.
*  You're always finding something new, hopefully.
*  So then always our final question.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  So for these books, I kind of thought about books that have changed my taste and are kind
*  of books about aesthetics and consumption that stick with you and help you think about
*  the world in a different way.
*  So the first one is this Japanese novelist, Junichiro Tanizaki's 1933 essay, In Praise
*  of Shadows.
*  This is a very small book or a very long essay in which Tanizaki kind of muses on his own
*  taste and why he designed his house in a certain way and why he chooses food in a certain way
*  or like installs lamps in a certain way.
*  And the point at which he was writing was just as Tokyo was industrializing and it was
*  when neon lights were being installed and trains were running through the city.
*  In the essay, he kind of offers this puzzle of what if modernity or industrialization
*  had been invented by Japanese people instead of the West?
*  Like how could the world be different?
*  And I just find it so powerful because it's like looking at the world from the opposite
*  direction.
*  What if you prized shadows as much as sunlight?
*  What if you thought about dimness as much as you think about illumination or soft decaying
*  textures as much as you think about perfectly clean, bright porcelain?
*  And I've thought about it every day since I read it.
*  The next book was Seeing is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees by Lawrence Wetchler.
*  And this is a biography or almost a memoir of being with the artist Robert Irwin, who
*  is a light and space artist from California, kind of like a minimalist but in an atmospheric
*  environmental installation way.
*  And Wetchler really records how Robert Irwin became an artist, how he thinks about his
*  practice of art.
*  Everyone who reads this book wants to become a conceptual installation artist.
*  And then the last book was The Mushroom at the End of the World, The Possibility of Life
*  in Capitalist Ruins, which is by Anna Lowenhaupt Singh.
*  And this is an academic book, but it's almost this first-person sociology of mushroom foraging,
*  particularly matutake mushrooms.
*  And these mushrooms cannot be domesticated.
*  They have to be found and collected.
*  And then they're sold and dispersed across the world through these very strange human-to-human
*  chains of economic and social value that Anna records.
*  And I love the book because it was such a niche world that she observed so closely.
*  And I think to me that book is fundamentally about how scarcity creates meaning and how
*  webs of human-to-human connection create meaning around whatever it is we consume, whether
*  it's like a piece of art or an actual mushroom.
