# The Sermons I Needed to Hear Right Now
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYlXG-6C9RI)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Everything I'm about to talk about is hard to talk about.
*  It is hard to talk about because it's personal to me.
*  It's hard to talk about because it's happening in the midst of an active, hellacious war.
*  And it's hard to talk about because even when there is not a war, this is just hard to talk
*  about.
*  Maybe I'll start here.
*  I think something we're seeing in the politics in America around Israel right now, I think
*  it reflects three generations with very different lived experiences of what Israel is.
*  Of older Americans, said Joe Biden, who saw Israel as the haven for the Jews and who also
*  saw Israel when it was weak and small, when it really could have been wiped off the map
*  by its neighbors.
*  They have a lived sense of Israel's impossibility and its vulnerability and the dangers of the
*  neighborhood in which it is in.
*  Their views of Israel formed around the Israel of the Six-Day War in 1967, when its neighbors
*  massed to try and strangle Israel when it was young, or the Yom Kippur War in 1973 when
*  they surprise attacked Israel 50 years ago.
*  Their views of Israel formed around Israel's war for independence, around the Six-Day
*  War in 1967, when its neighbors massed to try and strangle Israel when it was young,
*  around the Yom Kippur War in 1973 when they surprise attacked.
*  Then there's the next generation, my generation, I think.
*  And I think of us as this straddle generation.
*  We only ever knew a strong Israel, an Israel that was undoubtedly the strongest country
*  in the region, a nuclear Israel, an Israel backed by America's unwavering military and
*  political support.
*  That wasn't always true, at least not to the extent now.
*  In his great book, The Much Too Promised Land, Aaron David Miller points out that before
*  the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Israel ranked 24th in foreign aid from the U.S., 24th.
*  Within a few years of that war, it ranked first, as it typically has since.
*  We also knew an Israel that was an occupying force, a country that could and did impose
*  its will on Palestinians.
*  And I don't want to be euphemistic about this, an Israel in which Palestinians were an oppressed
*  their lives and their security and their freedom were worth less.
*  But we also knew an Israel that had a strong peace movement, where the moral horror of
*  that occupation was widely recognized.
*  We knew an Israel where the leaders were trying, imperfectly but seriously and continuously,
*  to become something better, to become something different, to become in the eyes of the world,
*  but Israel was in its own eyes.
*  A Jewish state, but a humane and moral one.
*  And then, as Yassi Klein-Alevi described on the show recently, that peace movement collapsed.
*  The why of this is no mystery.
*  The second intifada, the endless suicide bombings, were a trauma Israel still has not recovered
*  from.
*  And they posed a horrible question, to which the left, both in Israel and in America, had
*  no real answer then or now.
*  If your story of all this is simplistic, if it is just that Israel wanted this, it is
*  wrong.
*  What happened then is Israel moved right, and further right, and further right.
*  Extremists, once on the margin of Israeli politics and society, became cabinet ministers
*  and coalition members.
*  The settlers in the West Bank ran wild, functionally annexing more and more territory, sometimes
*  violently, territory that was meant to be returned to Palestinians, and doing so with
*  the backing of the Israeli state, doing so in a way that made a two-state solution look
*  less and less possible.
*  Israel withdrew from Gaza, and when Hamas took control, they blockaded Gaza, leaving
*  Gazans to misery, to poverty.
*  Israel stopped trying to become something other than an occupier nation.
*  It became deeply illiberal.
*  It settled into a strategy of security through subjugation, and many in its government openly
*  desired expansion through expulsion.
*  And so now you have this generation, the one coming of age now, the one that has only known
*  this Israel, Netanyahu's Israel, Ben Gavir's Israel.
*  I've been thinking a lot about the panic in the Jewish community, about what gets shorthanded
*  as anti-Semitism on campus, and there is anti-Semitism on campus, and on the left, and on the right,
*  always has been.
*  But to read only the most anti-Semitic signs in a rally, to hear only the anti-Semitic
*  chants, can also obscure what else is happening there.
*  If it's just anti-Semitism, then at least it is simple.
*  They just hate the Jews.
*  They hate us.
*  They always have.
*  They always will.
*  But a lot of what is happening at these rallies is not just anti-Semitism.
*  A lot of it is a generation that has only known Israel as a strong nation oppressing
*  a weak people.
*  They never knew a weak Israel.
*  They never knew an Israel whose leaders sought peace, showed up to negotiate deals, who wanted
*  something better.
*  And I am not unsympathetic to the Israeli narrative here.
*  I believe large parts of it.
*  We have an episode coming soon on the many failures of the peace process, and the Israelis
*  who say they did not have a partner, they are right.
*  But that does not justify what Israel became, and there are consequences to what it has
*  become.
*  There was this Pew survey in 2022 that I find really telling.
*  It found that 69% of Americans over age 65 had a favorable view of Israel.
*  But among Americans between ages 18 and 29, young Americans, 56% had an unfavorable view.
*  As it happens, American politics right now is dominated by people over 65.
*  But it won't be forever.
*  And there are many of us who warned of this exact thing happening.
*  Who said if you lose moral legitimacy, you will not have the world's goodwill when you
*  need it most.
*  Who said it is a problem for the Jewish state to not be seen, to not be a moral state.
*  It is a problem geopolitically, and it is a problem spiritually.
*  Because for Jewish Americans, and I am one, Israel isn't simply a question of politics.
*  It is the Jewish state.
*  So what does what Israel is say about Judaism?
*  What does Judaism say about it?
*  This has been an almost exquisitely uncomfortable space.
*  To believe Israel had become something indefensible on 10-6.
*  To know that it needed defenders on 10-7.
*  To know that anti-Semitism is real, and every century seems to have its era of butchering
*  the Jews.
*  To believe deeply the Jewishness is about how we treat the stranger is defined by the
*  lessons of exile, and to see the Jewish state inflicting exile on so many.
*  To value all lives, and see so many of our one-time allies devaluing our own.
*  Throughout these last few months, I've been extremely moved by the sermons of Rabbi Sharon
*  Brefs of Los Angeles' Ikar Synagogue.
*  She has a book coming out called The Amen Effect, which you can and you should pre-order.
*  I've read some of it.
*  But I got to know her through these sermons, which did something very few people have been
*  able to do, at least for me.
*  Which is to find a prophetic voice, rooted in the Jewish tradition, that can hold this
*  complexity.
*  These questions of Israel, both in critique and defense, of Jewishness, of liberalism,
*  of anti-Semitism, of identity.
*  And so I asked her to come on the show, to try to talk through topics, and to be honest,
*  I'm not all that comfortable talking about it all.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein Show at nytimes.com.
*  Rabbi Sharon Brefs, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you, Ezra.
*  It's good to be with you.
*  So on Yom Kippur this year, September 25th, a few weeks before Hamas' attack on Israel,
*  you gave this searing sermon about Israel's occupation and its increasingly right-wing
*  government and what it is becoming.
*  And I'm just going to play a clip of it here.
*  Telling the truth, very simply, is essential to healing.
*  We must tell the truth about what is happening, where we are, and how we got here.
*  I'm speaking right now especially to those among us who, like me, see in Israel a miraculous
*  national renaissance.
*  We who celebrate the astonishing revival of the Hebrew language, who take great pride,
*  not only in the safe haven, but also in the start-up nation, the flourishing of Jewish
*  art and ideas and culture, the rebirth of academies of Torah learning, the bounty and
*  the promise, the beauty and the bravery, even or especially in the face of grave threats,
*  the realization of the Jewish National Liberation Project.
*  All diagnosticians must take a serious effort to set aside our cognitive biases and see
*  what is truly before us, rather than what our implicit bias orients us toward.
*  But when we do, only then do we see that this government and its maximalist agenda
*  are the natural outcomes of a growing extremism in Israeli society manifesting most egregiously
*  in more than a half century of occupation.
*  56 years of too many people allowing our own trauma and fear to justify the denial of basic
*  rights, dignities and dreams for millions of Palestinian people living under Israeli
*  rule.
*  Decades of justifying an unjustifiable status quo as the only reasonable response to the
*  failures and missteps of Palestinian leadership and the violence of Palestinian extremists.
*  Many of us have spent years trying not to look.
*  We don't know because we don't want to know, because the world is sometimes cruel and unfair
*  to Jews and yes, delivers to Israel disproportionate opprobrium among all the bad state actors.
*  We don't want to know because we don't want to fuel anti-Semitism because accepting the
*  reality of Palestinian suffering under Israeli rule means accepting that the Jewish people
*  can be not only victims, but also victimizers.
*  That's not the kind of sermon you hear in a typical American synagogue.
*  I mean, not now, of course, but not before October 7th either, and particularly not on
*  Yom Kippur.
*  So why did you decide to make that your sermon?
*  Israel was the great dream that the Jewish people held through 2000 years of exile and
*  oppression and persecution and pogrom and ultimately genocide, that there could be a
*  place in this world where the Jewish people could be safe and where our Jewish values
*  could actually thrive not only behind the doors of the synagogue or the Beit Midrash,
*  the study hall or the schools, but actually in the public square.
*  And in many ways, the establishment of the state of Israel was miraculous for that reason.
*  And it's precisely because I think it matters so much that I'm so deeply worried about the
*  ways that these growing illiberal trends, these growing undemocratic and un-Jewish trends
*  in Israel are actually undermining that dream.
*  And my call was as an American rabbi and speaking to an American Jewish community, what is
*  our responsibility?
*  Are we to stay on the sidelines here and essentially just kind of keep our mouths shut?
*  Or must we cry out in a time of moral crisis when our own families and friends and colleagues
*  in Israel are essentially begging us to step into the fray?
*  And obviously I come out on the side that yes, this is our central obligation.
*  I said in the sermon that we have to fight against Jewish ideological extremism with
*  as much passion and as much fervor as our grandparents fought for the establishment
*  of the state in the first place after witnessing their entire families and communities decimated
*  in Europe that we needed to dedicate that much resource into actually fighting for the
*  future of Israel as a democracy and as a just state.
*  You went on to talk about a ceremony in Israel earlier this year on their National Remembrance
*  Day.
*  Can you tell me about that, the stories you heard and what you saw then?
*  So for the past many years, Israeli Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel and Palestinians
*  living in the West Bank who have lost loved ones in their immediate family, they have
*  formed an organization where they come together to share their grief.
*  And for the past several years, they have met on Yom HaZikaron, on Israel's Day of
*  Remembrance.
*  This is a really sad day in Israel.
*  The whole country essentially stops in order to grieve those people who died since the
*  founding of the state, whether serving in the IDF or through acts of terror or other
*  acts of violence.
*  And the idea behind the joint commemoration is that if we are going to live as neighbors,
*  we have to learn how to share our grief so that we can collectively build a shared society
*  and a shared future.
*  So one of the stories that was shared was by a man named Adel Abu Badawiyah, who told
*  about this terrible tragedy that had happened years ago.
*  He lived in Jenin with his family and the IDF came into Jenin for some action.
*  The children of the refugee camp where they lived all fled when the soldiers came in.
*  And his little brother Majed was five years old at the time and was really terrified of
*  the soldiers and ran away.
*  And the family afterwards couldn't find the little boy for many hours and they were searching
*  everywhere for him.
*  And finally, they discovered his body in a refrigerator.
*  In his terror, he had hidden there in order to escape these soldiers and then he couldn't
*  get out and he died in the refrigerator.
*  It's just a terribly tragic, awful, awful story.
*  Among the Israeli speakers who spoke was a professor from Tel Aviv University, Amanda
*  Buval Sapir, who talked about his sister Tamar, who was a young newlywed in the 90s when a
*  Palestinian man blew up the bus that she was riding in downtown Tel Aviv.
*  Many of us have memories and some of us, even friends and loved ones, who died in the era
*  of bus bombings in the late 90s and early 2000s.
*  And he talked about the black hole that opened up when his beautiful sister died.
*  And there are many other stories like this.
*  And to think these are the people in this conflict who have lost the most and they are
*  willing to stand together and to offer their stories as a testament not only to what they've
*  lost, but to what they hope can be recovered, which is some kind of shared sense of humanity,
*  even from the depths of the darkness.
*  What happened this past year, and for several years it's been extremely controversial because
*  many people in Israel feel that this is a sacred day to honor Jewish pain and not a
*  time to be building bridges with Palestinian neighbors.
*  But this past year, the protests were worse than they had been before.
*  Thousands of people gathered together in Tel Aviv for this joint forum.
*  And there were protesters who were outside who were honking horns and screaming and protesting,
*  doing everything they could essentially to drown out the words of the speakers.
*  And this is particularly heartbreaking because what you have is Palestinians who are standing
*  in this forum and Israeli Jews standing up to share the stories of the deaths of their
*  loved ones and how their hearts are shattered and how even still they hold the hope of a
*  better future.
*  And their voices are being drowned out by these protesters who are so threatened by the idea
*  of shared grief that they really want to shut it down at all costs.
*  I took the center of this sermon as not being the critique or description of what was happening
*  in Israel.
*  I took it as being about what people in your congregation and more broadly, and I'll put
*  myself in this category as well, were doing with it.
*  And to quote you here, you said, many of us have spent years trying not to look.
*  We don't know because we don't want to know.
*  And that approach to resolving this almost like unbearable cognitive tension here, cognitive
*  dissonance, simply looking away.
*  I'm Jewish.
*  I'm not Israeli.
*  I don't have traction on this.
*  I'm not there.
*  I'm not exposed to what they're exposed to and I don't have a vote.
*  I think that became very common.
*  I'd like to hear you talk a bit about that, about watching that happen among people you
*  cared about this issue and how you were trying to speak to that.
*  First, I think that the fear of being an American Jew or diaspora Jew and speaking out against
*  Israeli policy or a rightward trend in Israeli politics or Jewish religious extremism is
*  legitimately scary.
*  We understand how anti-Semitism works in the world and we understand the way that Israel
*  does receive disproportionate opprobrium among all bad state actors in the world.
*  And so it's scary to speak out and to feel like we might be contributing to a dynamic
*  that is fundamentally unfair and unfair to our family.
*  So that's the first piece.
*  But even more than that, I think for many American Jews, the obvious response to Israel's
*  rightward shift over these years was just to disengage and invest as much as we could
*  in the fight for racial justice, economic justice, climate justice, all of the things
*  that we feel are central to our own self-understanding and to our understanding of the kind of world
*  we want to build wherever we were.
*  So what we saw was a profound disengagement from Israel that essentially frayed the bonds
*  between these two communities.
*  This is a very small global Jewish community and the two great population centers are Israel
*  and the United States.
*  And the rift that we've seen between the two communities has been real and profound and
*  is a values rift.
*  And that's something that has been very worrisome over the course of the last couple of years.
*  And I believe that this anti-democratic trend is not only anti-democratic, but it's fundamentally
*  un-Jewish.
*  That the values that are core to our self-understanding as Jews in the world, which we derive both
*  from Torah, from thousands of years of Jewish tradition, and from our history, our history
*  of persecution, of exile, of genocide, that we have formed a core set of values that are
*  being undermined by those voices that come from the extreme in Israel.
*  And even as those voices have become more dominant in the government, I do not believe
*  that they are representative of the population of Israel.
*  And the proof text to that is that I don't know another country in the world that has
*  had this kind of civil disobedience that stopped literally only because October 7th happened
*  and it wasn't safe for people to gather en masse in the streets and everything kind of
*  shifted in that moment.
*  But I don't know of any other place that we can point to where the people have risen up
*  with such fervor week after week after week for 10 months straight in order to say, you
*  do not represent me.
*  So I don't think it's fair for the world to characterize Israel as taking this dramatic,
*  hardline, messianic, ethno-nationalist turn, but rather that there is a very significant,
*  dangerous core that has risen in power and found its way into the Knesset, into the
*  halls of power, and found its way into the street.
*  And it's our job to make sure that they don't become representative of the population.
*  You called this anti-Jewish.
*  And one question I want to ask, because it's a question that I've been wrestling with,
*  is whether that's true.
*  When you look at Israel, it's the most observant, the most religious Israelis who are the most
*  comfortable turning Israel into this entity that you fear, that I fear, that many of them
*  see the religion that we share, although understand differently, as a call for conquering biblical
*  lands, as a demand for a kind of strength and sword.
*  You're a rabbi.
*  There are obviously rabbis on the other side of this.
*  What are you reading differently than these, to be fair to them, very learned rabbis there
*  are seeing?
*  Yeah.
*  This is a really important question.
*  Every person of faith is engaging in an act of interpretation and choosing what text to
*  prioritize and how to read and interpret those texts.
*  And my choice is to read that the first and most important thing that we learn about
*  human beings in the beginning of the book of Genesis is that all human beings are created
*  with B'tselem Elohim in God's own image.
*  And the way that our rabbis read that 2,000 years ago was that every single person has
*  infinite worth, that all people are fundamentally equal, and that every single human life has
*  something unique to contribute in this world.
*  That is the core premise, the starting point for my faith and for my religious life.
*  And I didn't derive that from some 1990s feminist rereading of the tradition.
*  That comes from the book of Genesis, chapter one.
*  And then if you take a step back and look at the five books of Moses, if you look at
*  our core sacred literature, the Torah, you see that four of the five books of the Torah
*  are dedicated to the experience of our people, the Israelites, walking from out of degradation
*  and enslavement and barbarity and human cruelty toward the promised land on a quest to build
*  a just society.
*  That story, that core narrative lives at the heart of every Jewish ritual, every single
*  Jewish holiday.
*  It is at the heart of our prayer services.
*  There's not a morning, afternoon, or evening prayer where we don't recall the exodus from
*  Egypt.
*  And it is delivered not only as a narrative, but a narrative that is tied to specific moral
*  action, which is you were strangers in the land of Egypt.
*  Do not oppress the stranger.
*  You were strangers in the land of Egypt.
*  You know the heart of the stranger.
*  And you were strangers in the land of Egypt.
*  You must love the stranger, protect the stranger.
*  And that is the source of my Jewish faith.
*  Maybe I am reading our tradition wrong, and those extremist messianic figures deep in
*  bank who are teaching soldiers that they need to wipe out the enemy.
*  Maybe they're right and I'm wrong.
*  If that's the case, I will have a very hard and honest conversation with the Holy One
*  on the Day of Judgment.
*  Something you said a minute ago has to do with the experience of Jewishness, which is
*  very important to the way I understand both the tradition and its teaching that Jews are
*  an exile people.
*  Jewishness is religion formed out of displacement and oppression.
*  And over the past decade, 15 years after the collapse of the Israeli left, after the collapse
*  of the peace process, and I don't take anything away from how difficult and terrifying it
*  is or was to be in Israel in this period, and how confusing it is to know what to do
*  next when peace offers were met with violence, but to settle into a kind of comfort with
*  becoming the inflictor of displacement and oppression while still being the sole Jewish
*  state, it made me wonder a lot about what this all meant.
*  If you were to say what makes, I think, Jewish people or Jewish thinking exceptional, I think
*  it had a lot to do with those lessons of exile that's so core to the tradition.
*  And then when it came to it, when fear and strength collided with one another, they
*  didn't seem to make us act any differently than anyone else through history would have.
*  Well, I think there are two great lessons from history.
*  One is eventually, in essentially any historical context, at some point, live long enough in
*  a place and eventually the Jews will be excommunicated, exiled, pogroms, persecuted, or genocided.
*  And forgive me, I mean, not to grossly oversimplify Jewish history, but there are trend lines
*  that we have to notice here.
*  So what we learn from that, on one hand, the Torah explicitly demands that we learn from
*  that experience in Mizraim, in Egypt.
*  You know what it's like to be the oppressed minority.
*  That is built into your self-understanding.
*  Bring that with you wherever you go, whether that's to Los Angeles or to Brooklyn or to
*  Paris or to Tel Aviv.
*  So that's one side of the message.
*  The other side is, if I am not for myself, who will be for me?
*  The fact that Jews have suffered so profoundly historically in so many places, across so
*  much time, has taught our people that the world is a hostile place that doesn't actually
*  care about Jewish life.
*  Sometimes that hatred of Jews will be overt.
*  Sometimes it will be latent.
*  Eventually, it almost always surfaces.
*  And there's a very deep psychic trauma that comes from holding that history.
*  I can frame the tension in another way, which is there is an entrenched Jewish mentality
*  that comes from the book of Numbers, Amlava Dad Yishkon, that we are a people that dwells
*  alone and apart, that the world does not understand us and never really will, fundamentally,
*  and therefore we need to do what needs to be done.
*  That's also a lesson from history.
*  Or on the other side, the lesson of lo tov heit adam levado.
*  It's not good for a person or for a people to be alone in the world.
*  And our work in the world is to be bound up in the bonds of life.
*  And that's another tension that I think appears in the Jewish community.
*  Do we see ourselves as fundamentally alone and therefore primarily responsible for taking
*  care of ourselves?
*  Do we see ourselves as fundamentally a part of humanity and therefore see ourselves as
*  responsible for building a better world for everyone?
*  And what happens when those two values seem to be in conflict with one another?
*  So that is where, and I think it feels weird even to try to inhabit that space now, but
*  that is where your sermon was, where I think a lot of us were prior to October 7th.
*  Then push forward a few weeks.
*  Hamas attacks and kills 1,200 people in Israel, takes hundreds more hostage.
*  There are social media videos of the most astonishingly traumatic executions of Jewish
*  people that I think any of us have seen in modernity.
*  And there's also at the same time this explosion of rationalization of it, of justification
*  for it.
*  And this is where I began paying attention to your sermons in this period because somebody
*  sent me one of yours that talked about what you call the existential loneliness of the
*  Jew in that moment.
*  So what was that loneliness?
*  As you said, the violence of October 7th was absolutely staggering.
*  And I remember thinking in those early days, could we fathom another civilian population
*  anywhere in the world of any other nation in the world in which massacres at that scale
*  would lead not to some kind of condemnation, but instead to celebration in the street?
*  And I actually don't believe that we can fathom such a thing.
*  And I think that part of the loneliness, especially for those of us on the left, we felt like
*  we were part of an anti-racist movement.
*  We felt we were part of a movement working toward a just society.
*  And obviously in those spaces, any kind of atrocity committed against a civilian would
*  be outright condemned.
*  And I think what it has awakened in many American Jews is a very painful acknowledgement that
*  we thought we were part of a movement.
*  We thought we were part of a worldview that now it's clear doesn't think that we are part
*  of it.
*  And that's very, very painful.
*  And that's really something new for this population.
*  Sometimes, and it's actually something you say in that sermon, sometimes it can be easy
*  to miss who was there because it was so shocking who wasn't.
*  For everything we've been talking about, I think the answer to this community of Jews
*  in America who are liberal, who want Israel to be more liberal, who think there are other
*  ways forward has always been.
*  And I mean, this is a big split, both generationally and geographically.
*  In Judaism, you're naive.
*  You don't live here.
*  You don't know what it's like.
*  You don't know what these people are like.
*  You are naive.
*  The world you are painting would be nice.
*  It is not possible.
*  And you would hear it often from older Jews.
*  You did not live through what we lived through.
*  You think you are safe.
*  You are not.
*  You're naive.
*  We have to be strong.
*  We have to at times be brutal because if we are not, this will come back and it will kill us.
*  And I do think one reckoning, one very difficult reckoning,
*  I've seen a lot of people going through is, was I naive?
*  Were these other voices right?
*  I have been asking myself that question from the moment that I heard what was going on in Israel
*  on Shabbat morning, October 7th.
*  And here's how I have come to understand it.
*  Many of the people who have been critical of me as a progressive rabbinic voice in America,
*  of me and my colleagues, accused us for years of downplaying an anti-Semitism that they believed
*  was always a part of movement spaces and a part of the broader population.
*  And on some level, they were right.
*  I really wanted to believe that there's not a Nazi hiding under every rock.
*  And so I saw hints of really problematic ideology hovering under the surface.
*  And I fought very hard to believe that those were only small exceptions
*  and not reflective of a bigger, looming catastrophe.
*  And also I was right.
*  And we were right.
*  Because given the ever-present reality of that latent anti-Semitism previous to October 7th
*  latent, the only thing that we could do is reinvest in relationships and double down on the work
*  and recommit ourselves to building a shared future there and here that is a just future
*  for everyone.
*  Your next sermon was built around a reading of the story of Avraham and Lot.
*  Tell me the story and what you took from it.
*  This is the story that comes in the book of Genesis when Avraham has established himself
*  in the land and he came with his nephew Lot and with his wife, Sarah.
*  And Avraham, we meet him many times in the course of this Torah portion.
*  It's called Lech Licha.
*  And we meet him as a husband, as a father, as a businessman.
*  But once his nephew Lot is kidnapped, he's abducted in the war between the kings.
*  All of the sudden, Avraham's, he's called Avraham at that time,
*  Avraham's identity shifts.
*  He's no longer just a husband, a son, a warrior.
*  He's now a Hebrew.
*  And so the question is, what does it mean to be a Hebrew?
*  And what does it mean for a moment in time to shift our own self-understanding?
*  I'm looking at Genesis 14, 13, Avraham Ha'ivri, Avraham the Hebrew.
*  The way that I read it this year in light of October 7th
*  is that there are certain wounds to the spirit that are so profound
*  that they actually prompt a fundamental change in our identity.
*  That once this wound hits, we see ourselves differently than we did before.
*  A shift in our own self-understanding.
*  And I see this.
*  I've seen this in many American Jews who describe that after October 7th,
*  they understand themselves differently.
*  They're people who have never stepped foot into synagogue
*  and who would never take their family vacation to Israel,
*  who all of the sudden say, us and we, when they're talking about
*  what happened on October 7th and afterwards,
*  who are talking about being a part of this people
*  in a way that even takes them by surprise.
*  We have been changed by this moment.
*  And my argument in that sermon was that there are two sides to this new identity.
*  There certainly were for Avraham.
*  One side is he realizes how profoundly attached he actually is to his family.
*  And for the sake of the story, let me remind us that
*  Avraham and Lot are a little bit estranged from each other.
*  And even still, his estranged family being taken captive awakens something in him
*  that helped him understand that he was responsible.
*  He was the one who was responsible for getting Lot back from captivity,
*  which he ultimately does.
*  He's able to bring Lot and all the other captives back.
*  And there's another element to the identity of the Ivri.
*  So right after Lot returns home, the text says,
*  Al-Tirah Avraham.
*  God says to Abraham in Genesis 15, verse 1,
*  Don't be afraid Avraham.
*  And it's kind of a funny thing for the Torah to be saying,
*  don't be afraid, because what would he be afraid of?
*  He just won the war.
*  The war is over.
*  He's back in peacetime now.
*  His nephew is home safely.
*  Why would he be afraid?
*  And the rabbis say, and this is 2,000 years ago,
*  he was afraid because maybe there was one righteous innocent
*  among the people that he killed in order to get his captive nephew home.
*  And so what I understand about the identity of the Hebrew, to be an Ivri,
*  is to understand the depth of connection, obligation, responsibility that we have
*  to our family, even our estranged family.
*  And at the same time, to live with the constant awareness
*  that our actions could cause great harm to others.
*  And our work in the world as descendants of Avraham
*  is to do everything in our power to minimize harm to other people.
*  And that felt like the call of this moment for me.
*  Matthew 18
*  Well, what I hear in that is these two very deep sides of not just Judaism,
*  but many traditions and many groups, which is, for lack of a better term,
*  the tribal and the ethical.
*  Having very deep, visceral commitments to your own kin, however you define that.
*  And how you balance that then with an ethical, a creedal,
*  a spiritual code that in theory is binding you to each other.
*  And I guess as a question of practice, not just a question of teaching,
*  how do you understand doing that?
*  Beth Dombkowski
*  It's very hard to hold both of these truths at once.
*  And when we're in trauma and in grief, and we are grieving now,
*  we are in av'elut, we are in a time of mourning,
*  it's really important that we take care of our hearts.
*  And not all of the work can be done at once.
*  And so I fully understand a kind of temporary retreat into the tribal.
*  And away from the universal for the moment.
*  The danger is staying in the tribal.
*  The research on this is quite extraordinary, because it shows that
*  the deeper our tribal connections, the weaker our connections to those outside our tribe.
*  And what I'm actually asking of myself and of us is that we strengthen our tribal attachment
*  at the same time that we strengthen our universalist attachment.
*  And it's extremely challenging to do it.
*  And so I have just taken it upon myself these last five weeks to continue to remind
*  our Jewish community that we can be tribal in this moment.
*  We can and we must engage in the side of the identity of the Hebrew
*  that takes care of other Hebrews right now.
*  That's part of what it means to care for your family.
*  And it can never end there.
*  Because ultimately the problem of the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small.
*  And we know the pain of the world's drawing the circle of their family
*  small enough that it excludes us.
*  We must not exclude others ultimately.
*  This reminds me of one of the threads from the sermon you gave a week after October 7th
*  about trying to walk this line.
*  Just an overwhelming feeling for many Jewish people in that moment was this deep sense of fear
*  and isolation.
*  And that if the world is this dangerous, then I have to act accordingly.
*  And you said that we who have been excluded by the narrowest scope of others' moral concern
*  must not narrow the scope of our moral concern to exclude others.
*  And you went on to say,
*  Tell me about walking that tightrope for you.
*  We know what loneliness and isolation does to the human heart.
*  We know just on an individual basis, and I'm very invested in the work and thinking of Dr.
*  Vivek Murthy right now about loneliness.
*  We understand now what loneliness does to the spirit and to the body of a person experiencing it.
*  Loneliness kills us.
*  It's a sickness in us.
*  It hurts our hearts physically and spiritually.
*  It makes us retreat.
*  It makes us behave badly.
*  Now imagine that on a collective scale.
*  My concern is that right now, the existential loneliness combined with the utter anguish
*  and shock of the atrocities that were committed, combined with the fear that comes from the scroll
*  on my neighbor congregants' garage that says, feed the Jews to the pigs.
*  When we encounter this kind of overt anti-Semitism, and so we're now dealing not only
*  with loneliness, but also with a very real fear for our own safety and security,
*  my fear is that we lead not with our best moral thinking.
*  When we experience how incredibly painful it is to see that our own lives and our family's lives
*  do not matter to many, many people in the world, that many people, including those who we thought
*  were our allies and our friends, do not shed a tear when our elders are abducted and taken
*  into captivity.
*  What we must do, in addition to fighting to get all of those who are captive home immediately,
*  but what we must do is heart work.
*  We have to make sure that we don't close our hearts because there are also many, many people
*  who don't think that Palestinian lives are worth anything and who don't shed a tear when
*  Palestinian children die.
*  And so how can we, who desperately cry out for the world to take Jewish suffering seriously,
*  not also have our own hearts break when Palestinians are suffering?
*  It makes no sense.
*  And so we must also make sure that we extend our circle of care and concern
*  to include the innocents on the other side of that border who really have nothing to do
*  with this conflict and whose lives are in absolute misery right now.
*  And I know how hard it is to do that at the same time, because there are very few people
*  who are actually shedding tears when both Israeli Jews and Palestinians are dying.
*  There are very few people who are doing that.
*  And it feels to me that that is the essential struggle of this time, because I don't frankly
*  want to hear from the people who are in the streets who are shouting about decolonizing
*  Palestine, who do not shed a tear when Vivian Silver, a 74-year-old warrior for peace, who
*  dedicated her life to peace, is murdered by Hamas.
*  If your heart doesn't break for Vivian Silver, then don't tell me what you think my heart
*  should be breaking for.
*  And the same is true on the other side for the people who are absolutely devastated by
*  losses to Jews, but then feel it's offensive to even report on the Palestinian children
*  who are dying in Gaza.
*  I'm sorry, but we have lost our moral center.
*  What we have to do is expand our scope of moral concern to find the humanity in one
*  another again.
*  That is the call of our time.
*  You talked about going to Israel shortly after the attacks and bearing what you called sacred
*  witness.
*  What did that term mean for you?
*  I went to Israel two weeks after the massacres.
*  I went because I had a planned trip.
*  My niece became bat mitzvah.
*  They live outside of Tel Aviv.
*  It was a very scary and hard time and is for their family.
*  My presence, it felt, would really matter to them in that time.
*  And I went because I wanted to see and to hear and to stretch open my heart to the depths
*  of the horror of this reality so that I could come home and share with my community what
*  I had experienced.
*  The survivors from Aqibutz at the border called Kfar Aza, most of them were relocated to Aqibutz
*  outside of Tel Aviv because about 40% of Kfar Aza, this very peaceful Kibbutz at the border
*  was burned to the ground and many, many people died and many were abducted.
*  I went to this Kibbutz and I walked around the place in order to speak with and meet
*  with survivors, people who had themselves barely made it out alive.
*  And almost every person there had lost at least one immediate family member and many had family
*  members who were in Gaza abducted.
*  And as I speak about in the sermon, I was toured around this site by two guides who showed me
*  these picnic blankets surrounded by maybe 10 or so people sitting in plastic chairs.
*  And one of the guides said, this is Shiva.
*  And then the other guide corrected him and said, Shivot.
*  This is many Shivas happening all at once.
*  And there were about 100 Shivas.
*  A Shiva is a house of mourning.
*  It's when after a loved one dies, friends and family come over to sit and tell stories
*  and comfort the bereaved.
*  And in this case, from this community, there were hundreds of people experiencing the
*  death of immediate loved ones all at once.
*  I felt when I walked around this Kibbutz that I was in a DP camp after the Holocaust.
*  The depth of human suffering, people walking around with bandages around their heads,
*  bandages through their hands because many of them had been locked in the safe room for up to 35
*  hours waiting for the IDF to come and rescue them.
*  And Hamas had shot through the doors.
*  And so many of them had their hands shattered.
*  Just looking at the depth of sorrow and human suffering was profoundly humbling.
*  And I felt it was important for me to see it and experience it and to have my heart broken
*  again and again by hearing stories that people were sharing so that I could share back here
*  that perspective with my community.
*  This felt to me like the connecting thread of these three sermons, going back to the one about
*  Israel's government before the Hamas attacks, that in each of them, I saw at its core an argument
*  about the importance, at least right now, as a political act of simply bearing witness,
*  of not just looking but seeing, of not turning away, not turning away from what was really
*  happening in Israel, not turning away from what was really happening in the anti-Semitism
*  and cruelty of the response many had to Hamas's attacks, of then not looking away from how
*  complex this was all going to be and is to hold and to navigate.
*  And so I wanted to ask you about that, about that idea of bearing witness, of seeing,
*  of holding as a political and spiritual practice.
*  So there is a Mishnah, an ancient rabbinic text in the code of law that was codified
*  2,000 years ago that tells the story of what would happen when the people used to go up to
*  the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. And imagine Mecca, like hundreds of thousands of people
*  coming at once on a kind of sacred pilgrimage to Jerusalem. They would ascend the steps to the
*  Temple Mount, and then they would go through this arched entryway, and they would turn to the right,
*  and they would circle around the perimeter of this courtyard, and then they would exit essentially
*  right where they had come in. Except, the Mishnah says, for someone who's brokenhearted.
*  That person would go up to Jerusalem, they would ascend the steps, walk through the arched entryway,
*  but they would turn to the left. And every single person who would pass them coming from the right
*  would have to stop and ask this simple question, Malach, what happened to you?
*  And then the person would say, I'm brokenhearted. My loved one just died. I'm worried sick about my
*  kid. I found a lump. And the people who are walking from right to left would have to stop
*  and offer a blessing before they could continue on their pilgrimage.
*  And I just want to think about how profound the insight is in this ancient ritual. Because if you
*  spend your whole life dreaming of going up on this sacred pilgrimage to the holiest site, the holiest
*  place on the holiest days, and doing your circle around the courtyard, the last thing in the world
*  you want to do is stop and ask the poor guy who's coming toward you, are you okay? What's your story?
*  What's going on with you? And yet central to your religious obligation, in fact, the only religious
*  obligation you have that day is precisely to see this other person in their suffering, to ask them
*  what their story is, and then to give them a blessing. And if you're broken, shattered,
*  the last thing you want to do is show up in this space with all of these people and go against the
*  current in such a public, invisible way. And yet you're obligated to do that. And so I think the
*  rabbis kind of captured this very sacred and profound psychological and spiritual tool for us,
*  which is to say when we are suffering and when we're hurting, we need to be seen by other people.
*  We need somebody to say, tell me about your pain, help me understand what's going on for you.
*  And we need to be blessed. And that's why the loneliness of this moment feels so profound for
*  so many Jews, because we feel like, wait, we often ask people, tell me about your pain, tell me about
*  your suffering. How can I be a good ally? How can I stand with you in solidarity? Why aren't people
*  asking us? And it's a reminder for us that we have to reinforce our commitment to living in a
*  world in which we can see each other in our pain. And when we're walking from right to left, because
*  we're okay that day, not to turn our eyes away and our hearts away from the poor person who's
*  walking toward us who's broken that day. Otherwise, our humanity is lost to us. And it doesn't only hurt
*  the person who's broken, it hurts the whole society. It frankly hurts our democracy. It
*  endangers our democracy when we're unable to actually engage one another's pain, because we
*  feel that our cause is so righteous, our work is so holy, so important that we're going to keep
*  circling from the right, even though there are all these people who are quietly walking in the other
*  direction saying, please, please see me. I'm hurting right now and I need you to help me in this moment
*  of my pain. I need you to help me by bearing sacred witness to my heartache in this moment.
*  That's very beautiful. And then always our final question. What are three books you'd recommend to
*  the audience? The first is Abraham Joshua Heschel's seminal work, The Prophets, which for me in the
*  course of my rabbinate was an absolutely transformative book to help me understand
*  not only our prophetic tradition, but really what's demanded of us in a time of moral crisis.
*  And it's a book that I think about literally every day. The second is John O'Donoghue's book,
*  To Bless the Space Between Us. It is just sublime and beautiful and enchanting and reminds me of my
*  own humanity and of other people's, of our ability to bless each other with love. And he says,
*  we've fallen out of belonging. What does it mean to create a new reality in which we really
*  understand how much we belong to one another? And the third I would say is a novel written by
*  Yadjiazzi, Homegoing, which I really think is one of the best novels I've ever read. It is this epic
*  story of generations, of the descendants of two sisters from Ghana, the impact of violence and
*  enslavement and multi-generational trauma. And it's really also a story of hope and survival.
*  And I've read it many times. And each time I have this sense, I'm so honored to be turning these
*  pages right now and taking in this story. So those are my three today.
*  John O'Donoghue, Homegoing, and the Last Day.
