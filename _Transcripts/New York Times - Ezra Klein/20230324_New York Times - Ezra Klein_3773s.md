# A Radical Way of Thinking About Money
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [March 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6y8-aKs53E)
*  I'm Ezra Klein. This is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  So a bit of housekeeping before we get started. We are going to do another AMA episode pretty
*  soon. There's really a lot going on and we need your questions. We're only going to hold
*  this open for a week or two to handle the volume we get, but please send them over to
*  EzraKleinShow at NYTimes.com with the subject line AMA.
*  So for my sins, I've covered a number of financial crises now and certainly read about a lot
*  to say this. Every financial crisis is different and every financial crisis is the same. It's
*  always something that a lot of people thought was safe. Mortgage-backed bonds or banks holding
*  bucketfuls of long-term treasuries isn't safe. We were wrong. And when we're wrong and we need
*  to reassess how safe our money is or whether we can get money on the fly, we panic. We try to get
*  all the money out at once. We try to sell off what we think is going to be worth anything. We have
*  banks running and running on money markets and then the system goes into crisis. But notice that
*  there are two parts to that problem. You can think about it differently. One is a part about being
*  wrong, about something being safe. And so the implication of that might be we always need to
*  know what is and isn't safe. Regulators have to be more on the ball. Banks need to hold more
*  capital and report their financial condition in ever more detail. They need to imagine what would
*  happen to their capital if there was more financial stress. And because we can't do that
*  for every institution at the level of granularity we wish, we really need to figure it out for the
*  ones that we decide are important and we need to do it for them double hard. But you can also look
*  at the other side of that equation, the panic. You can say, well, we can't always know what's
*  safe. Life's going to surprise us. It always does. So what we need to do is make it so no one really
*  needs to panic even if something isn't safe. We need to panic proof the parts of the financial
*  system that can't be allowed to fail. That's how we stopped financial crises for a long time after
*  the Great Depression. The crown jewel of that project, and there was a lot of regulation and
*  supervision. That's all important too. But the crown jewel of that project was FDIC insurance.
*  You didn't have to run and get your money out of the bank even if you thought the bank was in
*  trouble because a government would back your money up no matter what happened to the bank.
*  We panic proofed the banking system and for a long time we didn't really have bank runs.
*  My guest today, Morgan Ricks, he thinks we need to do a lot more panic proofing.
*  He's now a law professor at Vanderbilt University, but he's worked on both Wall Street and in the
*  Treasury Department during the financial crisis. And he wrote the book, The Money Problem, to talk
*  about the 2008 financial crisis. But the theory of it, particularly this idea of money as something
*  bigger and more complex than we typically give it credit for, it ends up being a very powerful way
*  to think both about what went wrong at Silicon Valley Bank, but also what went wrong with the
*  Dodd-Frank regulations that allowed Silicon Valley Bank to happen, that did not stop this from
*  happening. So I brought him on to walk us through it. As always, my email is
*  azarclineshow.nytimes.com.
*  Morgan Ricks, welcome to the show.
*  Great to be here.
*  So let's begin this conversation back in 2009. You're working in the Treasury Department,
*  you're watching the global financial markets meltdown. And there is this split that emerges,
*  at least for you, between a dominant concept being systemic risk, how risky an institution is,
*  and the question being around panic proofing these short-term debt markets. Tell me a bit
*  about that split.
*  It was a bit of a split. I mean, there were a lot of problems in the financial sector,
*  and no one could deny that. And I was helping the team that was crafting Dodd-Frank, I was
*  helping that team out. And we all agreed that there were a lot of problems. But I really
*  thought there was one sort of preeminent problem for financial stability policy. And I thought it
*  always had been, which was the creation of what I'll call private monies. And we could
*  talk about that more a little later. But demandable and very short-term debt of the
*  financial sector, that it seemed to me was really the central problem for financial stability
*  policy. And I still think that. And so the alternate view was that that was a problem
*  more co-equal with a bunch of other problems. And they were all sort of grouped under this
*  catch-all phrase of systemic risk. And my view was always that that concept really wasn't that
*  coherent. It was sort of a placeholder for our ignorance or indecisiveness in the sense that
*  systemic risk could be in the eye of the beholder. It was whatever you wanted it to be.
*  And so I thought we needed to dig a little deeper and be a lot more targeted and specific.
*  Well, we've had in the law a definition of systemic risk or a systemically important
*  institution, which I think functionally means an institution we've decided is too big to fail.
*  And for a while, that was $50 billion in assets. Then there was a lobbying effort
*  during the Trump administration, which got almost every congressional Republican on board,
*  no small number of congressional Democrats, and ultimately the agreement of the Trump people.
*  And that moved the systemic risk or importance level up to $250 billion in assets. That's been
*  something people focused on a lot because Silicon Valley Bank was part of that lobbying effort. And
*  they would have been considered systemically important if they had not been successful in
*  getting that change made. So why isn't that a good enough definition? You could say, look,
*  we have this 50 billion bucks. We should have kept it where it was and everything would be fine.
*  Well, there's a lot of other financial institutions that are not banks. So the systemic
*  definition that you're referring to is part of Title I of Dodd-Frank and applied to banks and
*  bank holding companies and then other companies that were designated by the Financial Stability
*  Oversight Council as systemically important. But your listeners should know currently there are zero
*  non-bank financial companies that are so designated. And so we have a big financial
*  sector with a lot of different kinds of companies, including hedge funds below $50 billion or below
*  $100 billion, whose failure I think could be really catastrophic. And so picking sort of a single cut
*  off is perilous. I mean, we could say, look, Dodd-Frank got it right. 50 billion is obviously
*  the right number. But you could have a circumstance where a smaller money market mutual fund or a
*  smaller hedge fund below that size threshold would really cause big problems in the financial sector.
*  I think it's sort of fundamentally misguided to say this is a size-based test for systemicness.
*  So then there's another piece of that, which is to stay in that regulatory change.
*  The idea was if you classify an institution as systemically important, then you expose it to this
*  higher level of regulation, of oversight. You give it a stress test to see if its assets are good in
*  an adverse economic scenario. And I think one of the dominant narratives, particularly among
*  liberals, about what happened to Silicon Valley Bank is that it got out of this higher level
*  of regulation. And if it had just been kept in it, we'd be fine today. Do you think that's true?
*  I think it might be true. I mean, we can't run the counterfactual scenario where the 2018,
*  you're referring to the 2018 changes that rolled back a part of Dodd-Frank.
*  Yes.
*  That was in the Trump administration. The Republicans supported it. A lot of Democrats
*  supported it too and changed this threshold from 250 billion. Silicon Valley Bank supported the
*  change, lobbied for it, and it got them out of a lot of regulation and supervision. And it may well
*  be the case that in the absence of that change, the supervisors of Silicon Valley Bank would have
*  been more on top of things, would have been stress testing the institution. But it may not have been.
*  One thing that's interesting about Silicon Valley Bank is that its big issue was interest rate risk
*  in treasury securities. Now, treasury securities, I mean, traditionally we think, I mean, if banks
*  are going to hold something safe, that's sort of like the safest thing they can hold aside from
*  reserve balances of the Fed itself. And we have a whole history in this country since really the 1860s
*  of encouraging banks to buy more treasury securities precisely because they're safe.
*  And so it's not completely obvious to me that in a stress testing scenario, if they weren't really
*  looking very closely at interest rate risk, and the stress tests have not always looked at interest
*  rate risk, that the supervisors would have necessarily seen it and caused them to shorten
*  the duration of their portfolio or enter into interest rate hedges. I mean, the answer is maybe
*  yes, maybe no. One thing I think that gets at, which is interesting, is that one of the implications
*  of basing things on systemic risk and oversight regulation is that not only do you have to get
*  right who is systemically risky, which say what you will, we have definitely gotten wrong. I mean,
*  we said Silicon Valley Bank was no longer systemically important. Then when they failed,
*  we decided they actually were and guaranteed everything that was happening over there.
*  But that we also then have to be right about what kinds of risks are being posed to the system,
*  that if what you're doing is trying to peer into a bank or financial institutions innards
*  and say, listen, are they healthy? Then it's not just that they need to be healthy, but you need
*  to be right about what might occur next. And to your point about the Federal Reserve stress
*  test in 2022, they did not have the right forecast of interest rate risks. So it's very
*  possible Silicon Valley Bank would have passed the test because the regulators would have been
*  wrong in their forecast, just as Silicon Valley Bank was clearly wrong in its forecast.
*  So on the one hand, one of the good things I feel like about the Dodd-Frank rules is there's a fair
*  amount of regulatory discretion, which maybe you want in a complicated industry. But on the other
*  hand, fair amount of regulatory discretion means the regulators have to get it right and they have
*  to get it right again and again and again. And if you have a correlated failure in terms of what
*  the financial sector sees and what the regulators are paying the most attention to, then you could
*  have a really big mess on your hands. I think that's really well put. It puts a lot of pressure
*  on supervisors and regulators to really get everything right. And I think what we've learned
*  through history is like, that's a really tall order. You know, if you'd ask people in 2016 or
*  2017 if Silicon Valley Bank, a bank that was loading up in treasury securities, was something
*  we should be really concerned about, that has kind of a boring business model for the most part. I
*  mean, its clients are exciting. Its depositors have exciting businesses, but Silicon Valley Bank
*  was sort of a boring bank. And I think what a lot of people were focused on in the aftermath of the
*  financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 was really large, complex financial institutions, as it's called in
*  the industry, with lots of derivatives that are doing securities dealing, that are prime brokers
*  for hedge funds. And Silicon Valley Bank was none of those things. And I think it was quite natural
*  for people to be looking at those kinds of risks and not the kind of risks that Silicon Valley Bank
*  posed. And so it does. It puts a lot of pressure on regulators and supervisors to be very attuned
*  to all types of risks, even some that we haven't really seen materialize in quite some time. And
*  that's a tall order. So this is where your book makes a pretty profound move in its theory of
*  financial regulation. So the dominant theory, I think, has been to regulate in general
*  institutions, say, we've chosen, these are the important ones. Now we're going to cordon them
*  off. We're going to look very closely at them. We're going to keep an intense eye on them. We're
*  going to know a lot about their assets and liabilities and so on. And you're saying that's
*  a bit of a mugs game. And what we should instead do is panic proof the markets we're worried about
*  collapsing or the kinds of private monies, to use a term that I think is going to become important
*  here that we're worried about having default. So tell me about this idea of instead of focusing on
*  institutions and their stability, panic proofing entire markets.
*  Yeah. So I mean, one way of thinking about this is, look, I make the argument in the book that
*  really America's system of money and banking is broken. And, you know, sitting here today,
*  we've had four emergency interventions in the past 15 years to prop up a system that was
*  unraveling. That's the 2008 intervention, the Silicon Valley Bank intervention that just happened,
*  the COVID intervention, which is in many ways bigger than all the rest of them. And then there
*  was another intervention that is somewhat forgotten in 2019, where the Fed had to lend $300 billion
*  to Wall Street securities firms to prevent markets from unraveling at that point. And so unless we
*  do something fundamental, this is just going to keep happening. And so the argument in the book is
*  that what needs to be dealt with is private money. And people, maybe when you use that term,
*  will sort of think about Bitcoin. But that's not what I mean. I mean dollar denominated stuff.
*  You know, we're all thinking a lot right now about uninsured deposits. It was sort of Econ 101,
*  that deposits are a form of money. We use deposit accounts as money and banks are in the business of,
*  you know, they have more deposit liabilities than they do actual currency on the asset side of the
*  balance sheet. So they really ended up in a very real sense in the business of augmenting
*  the money supply. The Federal Reserve and other central banks understand this. They include bank
*  deposits in their measures of the money supply. And so when I say private money, I mean
*  defaultable money, money that is susceptible to default. So an uninsured bank account would be
*  that kind of thing. You know, a dollar bill is a type of money that is not defaultable, right? It
*  can decline in value, but there's no meaningful economic system which the Fed can default on it,
*  right? That's the nature of fiat money. So the argument again in the book is that uninsured
*  deposits and a lot of other types of private monies in the financial sector issued by all
*  sorts of institutions are really prone to unraveling. And those unraveling events have
*  a sort of self-fulfilling quality. And when that happens, that crushes the economy. And so these
*  instruments are really the primary source of danger that the financial system poses to the
*  economy. And so that's maybe a little more long-winded answer to your question, but at least
*  you would go- No, I actually want to go very slowly here. Because as you know, when we first spoke,
*  it took me some time to grock what you were saying, but I think once it is understood,
*  it's actually quite profound. So let me try to get at another wrinkle of it this way. The word money
*  is what I think you are pointing to as being confusing here. That when you say money, I think,
*  well, there's a thing, money, right? I have some of it in my wallet. I have some of it, in theory,
*  in my bank account. And you're saying there's not really money. There's a spectrum of qualities,
*  one might call moneyness. So tell me about moneyness. Yeah. So I think you're like most people
*  when they think about money as a concept, you're thinking about the green pieces of paper that we
*  hand around. But bank deposits are also money. We use them to make payments. When I pay my mortgage,
*  I'm not handing over a briefcase of dollar bills. I'm writing a check or actually doing an automatic
*  transfer out of my bank account. But it's the same idea. It's being done through a deposit account.
*  And so the deposit account really is money. Banks create deposit money in the course of making
*  investments, making loans and buying bonds. And so the banking system is out there augmenting
*  the money supply. And again, this is a well-understood thing within economics.
*  There's also some other things, and this is where we get into the moneyness concept,
*  that are quite similar, but not quite as money-like as a bank account. And so if you think about
*  another type of instrument most listeners may be familiar with would be a money market mutual fund.
*  And they issue you shares. And you can't actually use those shares directly to make a payment. I
*  mean, some money market funds offer payment services, but they do that because they connect
*  up with a bank. And so the shares of money market funds, we all understand are money-like. They're
*  kind of money substitutes, but they're not really transactable in the same way, say, a dollar bill
*  or a bank account is. So they're money, but they're a little less money-like. And then if you step
*  back and look more broadly across the financial sector, there are several markets that have this
*  sort of moneyness quality to them. And what they are is they're always really at bottom the same
*  thing. It's very, very short-term or demandable debt denominated in dollars. And so that includes
*  things like the repo markets, which people may have heard of or remember from 2008 that melted
*  down, something else called the Eurodollar markets, which we might get into later if we want to dig
*  deeper, but all sorts of- God, I hope not. That would turn out to actually be really important.
*  I mean, the Federal Reserve put in place swap lines just yesterday, which is done on a number
*  of occasions in the past, precisely in order to back the dollar denominated deposit liabilities
*  of non-US financial institutions. And so that's what those swap lines are really about. They
*  sound really mysterious, but that's what they are. But let me zoom out on this because you can,
*  even for me, I've covered financial crises. I've covered financial regulation. I've learned more
*  about repo markets than I ever really wanted to know. The thing that is consistent here
*  is that you have these money-like debts, which weirdly, I don't think people think of a deposit
*  this way, right? If you put money into the bank, you think, ah, my money is sitting there in the
*  bank. I think the operative metaphor in your mind is actually a kind of storage. But no,
*  what it turns out you have is a claim for the bank to give you back money, and they're actually not
*  holding all of your dollars all at once, which people know if they think about it, but I don't
*  think it's the way we naturally intuit it. But then when you go up a couple of levels to the
*  financial system itself, because they can't fund themselves by keeping $250,000 or less in a
*  federally insured deposit bank, they are constantly funding themselves on short-term debt.
*  So the way money works in the financial system, I think we assume Goldman Sachs has a lot of money,
*  but what they really have is a lot of these claims on money. Is that the right way to think about it?
*  Yeah, or they're issuing a lot of claims on themselves that's denominated in dollars.
*  I mean, the way to think about a broker dealer like Goldman Sachs is that it's funding itself
*  with things that look like deposits from the standpoint of its counterparty. Its counterparty
*  thinks of this as just a cash parking contract. It's called a repo, but that's part of its cash
*  balance. The suppliers of repo financing call that cash. They refer to it as cash. For accounting
*  purposes, it's classifiable as a cash equivalent. And even central banks sometimes recognize repo
*  claims as sort of a part of what they call the broad money supply. So there's all this financing
*  in the financial sector where large institutions especially are relying on really overnight or
*  demandable debt. And that from the standpoint of the counterparty that's financing them is
*  functionally equivalent to cash. And they're using it as part of their cash balance. They're
*  calling it a cash or cash equivalent instrument. And so now to bring these two things together,
*  the reason this matters is, as you said a few minutes ago, the thing we typically call money,
*  the dollars in my pocket, they don't default. They can lose value, but they don't default.
*  There's not a world where all of a sudden the Federal Reserve is not going to use them as money.
*  But these other things we're talking about, a deposit in a bank that is uninsured. So
*  a Roblox was keeping $150 million around in Silicon Valley Bank. So that is an uninsured deposit.
*  That can default if the Silicon Valley Bank falls apart. The repo market can default.
*  There are all these things that people are relying on as money that are short-term or
*  demandable debt, as you put it, that can default. And the big point you're making in the book
*  is that that is what financial crises are made out of. A default in a short-term debt market that
*  people were relying on as functionally money, even though it wasn't actually money backed by the state.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. So a default or a fear of default, right? I mean, we didn't actually end
*  up with a default in the case of SVB, but nonetheless, we ended up with a banking panic
*  that the Fed had to step in and the Treasury Department and the FDIC and take extraordinary
*  measures to make sure it didn't spread. And this is an idea, there are economists who have been
*  writing about this for a long time, Gary Gordon at Yale being probably the most prominent among them
*  who've written about this set of issues. And so I'm not the only one who to sort of conceptualize
*  financial crises in this way. But it is the case that when you look across the sweep of US history,
*  the severe acute financial crises we've had that are associated with severe acute macroeconomic
*  disasters, right? Deep recessions have all involved runs on private money. These things just seem to
*  crush the economy in a way that other sorts of financial disruption don't crush the economy as
*  much. I mean, the tech bubble bursting, right? There was a huge amount of lost wealth and we did
*  have a recession. It was a fairly mild recession though. Even the SNL debacle of the 80s where
*  deposit insurance had to be bailed out by Congress. We never had a panic in the system.
*  And again, we had like sort of a really mild recession in the early 90s. But the really bad
*  ones, the Great Depression, the panic of 1907 and the recession associated with that, and of course,
*  the Great Recession that started in very late 2007 and 2008, all involved this run behavior.
*  And I think there's a causal relationship there, right? I mean, this is something we can talk about
*  also. Just because there's correlation doesn't mean there is causation. But I think there are
*  good reasons to think that actually panics themselves really do crush the economy.
*  Well, let's talk a bit about that because you do, I think, a nice job in the book of outlining these
*  two sides of debate, which is we often have an economic crisis of some sort that starts somewhere
*  in what we might or might not call the real economy. But so for the financial crisis,
*  a couple of years ago, there was a problem in the housing markets for the tech bubble burst in 2000.
*  It turned out we had invested way too much in tech companies that didn't have an actual
*  profit rationale. You can go back to the Great Depression, right? There are real things happening
*  in the economy. And so one view of what happens is that the financial panic, the bank run, the
*  market crash, whatever, is a symptom of this actual problem. And until you fix the actual problem,
*  you can't fix the economy. And then the other view is that really the damage comes from the bank run,
*  from the financial panic, irrespective of what's going on in the actual economy. And you have a
*  nice little lineage of that latter view going back to Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, among others,
*  that I'd like you to talk through because I think it's an interesting argument.
*  So I think you laid that out really well. I mean, there's sort of a natural human tendency
*  to look at the panic in the private money markets and say, yes, but why did the panic happen? Right?
*  And to trace that back to some earlier cause, and there always is some earlier cause. I mean,
*  in this case, in SVB's case, it was an increase in interest rates that decreased the value of
*  their bond portfolio. And there's a natural, I think, human tendency to want to trace back
*  the causal chain to the beginning, right? Go back to the Big Bang as close to it as you can,
*  define the true fundamental cause. But I think that's actually a misguided way to approach policy.
*  But there are sort of two sides of this debate and have been for a long time sort of two sides
*  of this debate about whether we should care about the panics proper, right? The panic itself,
*  or whether we should be concerned about, say, boom and busts and asset markets that tend to
*  precede the panics. You mentioned Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz. They wrote sort of the
*  definitive monetary history of the United States, which they published in the 1960s.
*  And they took the money view, the panic view that I also adopt. I disagree with about Milton Friedman
*  with, well, on many things, but this is one thing I think he got right, which is that the Great
*  Depression was mostly a monetary phenomenon in the sense that the reason that we ended up with
*  unemployment above 20% is that we had a massive monetary contraction in the banking sector.
*  And Ben Bernanke's work has sort of expanded on that and looked at the effects of the panic
*  on the asset side of banks' balance sheets. But the panic is really the central part of the story
*  there and not the stock market crash of 1929, which did in some ways precipitate the panic.
*  But Milton Friedman said, it doesn't really matter what precipitated it. What matters is
*  the panic itself. We could talk more about the Great Depression. There are other contributing
*  causes to that. The international gold standard played a partial role there as well. But I think
*  most experts agree that the banking panic was a major driver of that recession.
*  So your theory and your book are written in the context of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
*  One of the reasons I wanted to talk to you here is that I'm always interested when a theory that
*  is built for one moment ends up being explanatory in another. And I think that's been true with the
*  collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and then the runs on a couple other banks. So tell me how you
*  understand from this perspective what happened at Silicon Valley Bank and the damage it did or at
*  least threatened to do to the economy. Yeah, so what happened is that depositors panicked
*  and there was a run on its deposits. And we could say there's a good reason for that run. I mean,
*  they had lost a lot of money on their asset portfolio. Interestingly, that loss was known
*  to the marketplace long before the depositors actually ran. I mean, SVB's fourth quarter
*  earnings were released on January 19th of this year and it showed the loss on their
*  treasury securities that ended up being a big part of what spooked the depositors. But there was a
*  run and the bank didn't have enough cash to cover it. Now, if it was going to be contained just to
*  that bank, then it's really no problem. You force the uninsured depositors to take a haircut
*  and everyone goes on with life. But the long experience with runs in these markets and what
*  the Fed understands and what the FDIC also understands in the Treasury Department is that
*  these things are contagious. There's a self-fulfilling quality to runs on money-like instruments. In fact,
*  the most recent Nobel Prize in economics went in part to Doug Diamond and Philip Dibbig who
*  are economists who are famous for having sort of modeled this formally, the self-fulfilling qualities
*  of bank runs. And so they have this contagious quality and when you see runs at one bank,
*  you start to see runs at others and then it swaps the system. And the result is, if not stemmed
*  by the central bank or the federal government in some capacity, then you end up with the economy
*  going into absolute freefall. That's the reason we care about this is because of the implications
*  for the real economy. And again, I think this question about looking for the specific cause
*  at Silicon Valley Bank, which in this case was rising interest rates that reduce the value of
*  its bond portfolio, is to miss the forest for the trees. We're looking at a very specific cause,
*  but the more general issue is the runnability of money claims themselves, private money itself.
*  And so my view is we really need to shore up the private money markets and then we could worry a
*  lot less about the particular types of events that could result in a run in the first place.
*  Pete Slauson One reason I find Silicon Valley Bank an interesting way to think about this theory
*  and this question of money is when we're talking about financial markets, like repo markets,
*  one, people very little familiarity with that, and two, we don't treat that stuff like money at all.
*  And so trying to mentally or conceptually reclassify it, to say nothing and reclassify it
*  under policy as something the federal government backs up is very unintuitive. But at Silicon
*  Valley Bank, what you have is interesting because you have a cutoff in the same kind of asset beneath
*  a level it's treated by the federal government as functionally sovereign, right? We will ensure any
*  deposit up until $250,000 and then in theory, although not obviously now in practice, above
*  that we will not. So below $250,000, this is money and you are entitled to it and if anything
*  happens, a state steps in to make sure you get it. And above that, you know, you're on your own.
*  Now we didn't do that, which I think shows that we don't really believe that. We don't want money
*  that people keep in a bank if it's $300,000 to actually be fake above the $250,000 line.
*  They're not fake, but defaultable. But that to me is the place where you start to see, I think,
*  what you're talking about here, which is that you can have just through law the exact same kind of
*  asset and part of it is public money and part of it is private money. And then there's a question
*  of whether or not we really believe in that cutoff we've created. Yeah, well, we don't believe in it
*  for the largest banks. I mean, I don't think anyone would tell you with a straight face
*  that it would be conceivable for an uninsured deposit at JP Morgan, Bank of America, or Citi,
*  or Wells Fargo, would ever be allowed to default in the event of the distress of one of those
*  institutions. We would be courting economic disaster if we allowed that to happen. And so
*  those are implicitly guaranteed and we just have to confront the fact that that's true.
*  We have a lot of small banks in this country where it's not uncommon when they go unsolvent
*  for uninsured depositors to take losses because the FDIC is just convinced that it's not going
*  to spread from there. And then there's sort of this mid-range of banks. I would have thought
*  SVB was on the smaller side in the sense that I would have thought that regulators and the FDIC
*  would allow them to default on their uninsured deposits, but they didn't. And so there's this
*  sort of gray zone in the middle when it comes to the size of the institutions. Stepping back for
*  just one second, I mean, one thing you suggested is that the repo markets and these other
*  institutional money markets might just be backed by the Fed. I think they are probably implicitly
*  backed by the Fed. It keeps stepping in to protect those as well, just as it does for did for
*  uninsured deposits in the SVB case. But this strikes me as a really, really bad way to approach
*  how to deal with these issues, to be able to have institutions that are able to essentially create
*  monies and have it backstop by the state without paying anything for that creates all sorts of
*  other problems and side effects that we shouldn't be happy about. In the Financial Times,
*  Martin Wolf has a line where he writes, banking stands revealed as a part of the state,
*  masquerading as part of the private sector. How do you think about that?
*  That's the whole design of our banking laws. From the start of federal banking laws in the US,
*  generally applicable federal banking laws, which really started in the Lincoln administration
*  during the Civil War during a monetary crisis. What the federal government did was it chartered
*  banks, federally chartered banks. Corporate chartering in the US is almost always by the
*  states, but this is the one area. The federal government charters banks in order to issue the
*  money supply. In fact, back then, they were issuing what were called bank notes, which were tangible
*  dollar bill type things, but they were issued by banks. But the federal government, the Lincoln
*  administration wanted to make sure all that stuff was really stable, all the notes were printed,
*  and had to be collateralized by treasuries. The way this was spoken about at the time is that
*  they were delegating their sovereign power of creating money to these entities that were created
*  by the state for that purpose. That banks exercise delegated power. It was an outsourcing. It was
*  very self-consciously an outsourcing arrangement. The National Bank Act of 1864 is still the core
*  of our federal banking laws. It's the bedrock of all of our federal banking laws. We sort of lost
*  sight of it. I think that's a big part of the problem. But that's just a way of saying that
*  Martin Wolf is recapturing here the traditional understanding of what banks are and what their
*  relationship is to the state. So the federal government steps in at Silicon Valley Bank.
*  They insure deposits up to really any amount. They extend lending and other stabilization
*  facilities to other banks, but you still begin to see a fair amount of contagion. It goes overseas
*  to banks that are in a pretty different situation like Credit Suisse, which is now getting sold off
*  to UBS. Why are we seeing, despite the extension of the insurance here, so much fear and contagion?
*  Yeah, that's a great question. To think back to 2008, and I think this is something that
*  Hank Paulson said, is that when problems erupt in these markets, you want to bring a bazooka.
*  If you bring a bazooka, you might not have to use it, is the idea. We could argue about whether the
*  Fed and the FDIC here brought a bazooka. I mean, the real bazooka would have been if they could have
*  announced a temporary guarantee of all deposits in the financial system. They did that in 2008.
*  That's exactly what they did. They guaranteed money funds and sort of tried to back every segment of
*  the private money markets. This time around, they didn't bring maybe quite as big a bazooka,
*  in part because they couldn't. They couldn't do a transaction guarantee of all deposits of all banks
*  in the system without a joint resolution of Congress. That's a change to the law that happened
*  in 2010. So they were a bit more constrained in what they could do. And it may be that if they had
*  done something bigger, and we can argue about what that might be, but that if they were able to or
*  had done something bigger, that we would not have seen any contagion at all. It's hard to predict
*  how these things are going to play out. Even after Lehman went bankrupt, the day after it went
*  bankrupt, leading economists, some of them were sort of cheering and saying, look, Lehman Brothers
*  wasn't big enough to cause big enough issues in our economy. And I think in retrospect, that
*  prediction sort of turned out to be wrong. So you just don't know how things are going to play out.
*  And if your bazooka isn't quite big enough, you can still see problems spread. And I think that's
*  what we saw here. So one of the historical arguments you make is that, and other people have made as
*  well, is that the inspiration we should look back to is a creation of deposit insurance,
*  which when it is created, when it covers far more of the money in the system, ends up creating a
*  fairly long period of banking quiet after I think what is fairly said to be a very loud period of
*  banking crisis before it. So tell me a bit about that history. What happens after deposit insurance
*  and what do we learn from that now? I think this is a really crucial thing to understand
*  is that we've had this private money problem a lot in US history, but we fixed it before.
*  We fixed it successfully. So in the 19th and the first third of the 20th century, we were seeing
*  panics essentially like every decade on average, and they were really crushing the economy,
*  especially the Great Depression, which is partially, as I mentioned earlier, a consequence of a
*  widespread bank run. But we fixed it. We fixed it over time. And yes, deposit insurance was
*  the last piece of the puzzle that came in at 1933. But it was part of a larger and coherent
*  framework that came actually in three key pieces of legislation. First was the National Bank Act,
*  which I referred to earlier in the Lincoln administration. Second was the Federal Reserve
*  Act of 1913. And then the third one was the Banking Act of 1933, which did a couple of things. The
*  most important was deposit insurance, as well as the Glass-Steagall Prohibition, which people may
*  recall was separating commercial and investment banking. And so once we did that, the 33 Act was
*  sort of the last piece of the puzzle. And we had a really coherent system at that point for dealing
*  with the private money problem, which was for there to be a lot less private money. So we essentially
*  confined all private sector money creation to this set of banks. And we backed it for the most part
*  through deposit insurance. And this worked for 75 years. We didn't have another banking panic. And
*  we didn't have another recession on the scale of the Great Depression or even the Great Recession.
*  So what happened is that we let this legal system erode. We degraded it and let it essentially
*  collapse. And that started in earnest in the 1980s. So I think the question is whether we can fix it
*  again. But the broad takeaway, Ezra, is that, yeah, a key aspect of the way we solved the problem was
*  we said, we're just not going to have private money anymore. We're going to have public backing
*  through the deposit insurance system of the money created by the banking sector. And we're not going
*  to have money created outside the banking sector. And that really worked. I think when something is
*  part of our system, I was thinking about this with public libraries, which I find it basically
*  impossible to imagine we would create today. But I think when something is part of the system,
*  we can ignore mentally what a big cognitive or ideological jump it was for people to get there
*  when it happened. And deposit insurance always feels like this to me, that to go from a world
*  where banking was quite profoundly a private matter. I mean, there was some public regulation,
*  but the idea that the government is responsible for if you put your money somewhere that wasn't
*  safe. It's not that nothing like that had ever happened, but to do it so broadly.
*  That's a very big jump. And there were people who thought that was crazy, and it would create all
*  kinds of moral hazard. And it's very important for people to assess the risks they take and for
*  banks to be exposed to the risks they take, right? If you insure all their deposits, and of course,
*  they can do stupid things. Can you just talk for a minute about that part of it, that move from
*  understanding this money is private to public? Yeah, you know, I think about this kind of issue
*  a lot, because I just think there's a lot of status quo bias, certainly in my field. And this
*  applies to maybe every field. I don't really know, but I can only really speak for mine.
*  And I often wonder whether people who often seem so hesitant to do anything of any real size,
*  as opposed to just incremental tinkering around the margins, would have voted if they had been in
*  Congress for deposit insurance, right? Would have voted for the National Bank Act. I mean, these big
*  moments, or the Federal Reserve Act, right? These big moments of discontinuous change, right? We're
*  really doing something big. We're going to take a new and different path. And so, you know, deposit
*  insurance, when it was passed, was very controversial. Actually, FDR himself was pretty
*  ambivalent, in some ways, pretty negative on it. And it was part of a bigger legislative package.
*  But the idea had been around for some time. I mean, William Jennings Bryan had been championing,
*  had championed deposit insurance in the very early 20th century. So it's something that had
*  been sort of floating around in the air, and ended up getting into the legislation. You know, I think
*  the key thing to think about is that, you know, we were at a moment of utter despair as a nation
*  at that point, and economic catastrophe on a scale that had never seen, been seen before or since in
*  this country. And so that created the political landscape for really doing things that were
*  discontinuous, and that were big changes where we were taking a big jump. And I sometimes wonder,
*  you know, look, I helped work on Dodd-Frank. I'm a big fan of big parts of Dodd-Frank. But I think,
*  in some ways, we missed the mark. And I sometimes wonder whether we'll get another good chance
*  to do something really fundamental without a crisis that again plunges us into a deep recession.
*  And, you know, honestly, I'm as worried about democracy if that happens as I am about the
*  economy. So I think it usually takes a really big crisis to get really big change.
*  So you wrote a Washington Post op-ed with Lev Menon arguing that we should do explicitly what now we
*  appear to have done implicitly, which is to say that the current $250,000 cap, its window dressing,
*  you called it, and the government should formalize unlimited deposit insurance. So first, tell me what
*  the best arguments you hear against that proposal are, given that we did step in to do this rescue.
*  Why do people say we shouldn't do that for everybody as a matter of policy? And then tell me
*  where you think they fall short and why you advocate it.
*  Yeah, so the big argument against that is moral hazard, which has always been the argument
*  against having deposit insurance in the first place by its opponents, but also against extending
*  it. And so what's moral hazard? You know, this is a concept from sort of economic and finance concept.
*  The idea is that if someone else is bearing at least part of the downside, then you have an
*  incentive to take more risks as you get more of the upside. And so deposit insurance has this quality,
*  right? It's the deposit insurer that's taking the downside if the bank loses a lot of money
*  on its asset portfolio. But then it's the shareholders of the bank that are the winners.
*  If the bank makes a lot of risky, high interest rate loans and they pay off, right? That's great
*  for the equity holders. And so if there's an asymmetry here in who's bearing the upside and
*  who's bearing the downside, then that's what we call moral hazard. And it's a theory of incentives
*  of bankers is what it is. And I think there are some problems with this theory when we think about
*  getting rid of the deposit insurance cap, which is that it presupposes that depositors are really
*  monitoring the bank in sort of real time. And that they're going to run away from the bank when
*  they see it taking more risks that might get it into trouble. And that is what supposedly is going
*  to discipline, be what's called market discipline on the bankers, not to take more risks. Because if
*  depositors aren't monitoring the bank, then the executives, the bankers still have the incentive
*  to take big risks because it's still externalizing the costs of failure. It's just on the depositors,
*  but not the FDIC. But from the standpoint of the banker, that really makes no difference.
*  So the idea that deposit insurance induces moral hazard depends critically as a theoretical matter
*  on the idea that depositors are sort of monitoring in real time. And we know there's lots of reasons
*  in both theory and evidence that we see in the world that depositors, even big depositors,
*  really just don't do that. So on the theoretical side, I mean, there's a whole body of literature.
*  Gary Gorton at Yale again is a big contributor here and Bengt Holmstrom at MIT. There's a whole
*  body of theory that explains why money market creditors like this or depositors, holders of
*  what's supposed to be safe claims, really don't do credit analysis. And they shouldn't be expected
*  to. They're what's called informationally insensitive. And so there's a body of theory
*  here that suggests that's true. And there's also just a lot of evidence that we know in a lot of
*  parts of the money market where money market claimants just don't do credit analysis in real
*  time. I think the counter argument to this is, well, didn't the SVB creditors, didn't those
*  depositors pay attention and actually discipline the bank? But this goes back to a point I alluded
*  to earlier is, you know, they only ran after SVB, if you'll recall, had a failed equity offering
*  on Wednesday evening because they had just taken a big loss and announced that they had taken a big
*  loss on a portion of their portfolio that they sold. And the equity markets, the stock markets,
*  which are monitoring in real time and doing excruciatingly detailed analysis on bank balance
*  sheets, realized that this had big implications for their balance sheet and their earnings power.
*  And it's only then that the depositors, when they saw, I think it was about a 40% drop in the stock
*  from closing on Wednesday to opening on Thursday, that the depositors actually started paying
*  attention. And somebody goes back and looks at the earnings release and says, oh my gosh,
*  they have a lot of losses on their held to maturity portfolio. And then they all start in
*  their chat groups or text groups panicking and running away from the bank. But it's not the case
*  that depositors had been monitoring the bank in real time. I would wager that zero of those
*  depositors, when the earnings release of SVB had come out back on January 19th, had actually even
*  looked or even probably known it was released, right? They weren't concerned about that. They
*  weren't doing the monitoring. And if I'm right about that, then the whole theory that deposit
*  insurance is creating moral hazard starts to look less compelling. Well, let me offer another version
*  of that theory. So I think you're completely right. The idea that you have a mid-sized auto
*  parts company is sitting around assessing bank risk is ridiculous. But the system we seem to
*  have at the moment is that if a bank like this fails, the federal government is going to step in
*  and it's going to be the lender of last resort, or it's going to be the insurer of last resort.
*  And in fact, people are not going to lose their money. But you really don't want to end up in
*  the situation, oh, ye bank executive, because you're going to go down in history as a total
*  failure. You're going to lose your job. You're going to be front page news for a while. Your
*  entire bank is going to collapse. Your legacy is going to be gone. So there is a moral hazard
*  problem here by going up to unlimited deposits insurance. And the moral hazard problem is that
*  right now banks are, in theory, at least fairly well incentivized to not become Silicon Valley
*  bank. You really don't want to be Silicon Valley bank. You really don't want the reputation that
*  Greg Becker, the former now CEO has of the guy who let your bank or the woman who let your bank
*  completely collapse on your watch. And that this is actually a totally fine system that, you know,
*  having this kind of slightly ambiguous situation where the government will step in if it gets bad
*  enough, but because you don't really know what bad enough means, you're incentivized to not let it
*  get bad enough, is a bit of the best of both worlds because otherwise you're going to have
*  too much of banks playing fast and loose with what ends up being taxpayer or somehow public money.
*  Well, look, I mean, that's the situation the largest banks are in anyway, because everyone
*  knows that those are implicitly guaranteed. But look, you know, the way FDIC resolution
*  usually works is the FDIC doesn't wait for a run to happen. They're monitoring the banks,
*  and so are the other supervisors. We've talked about the fact that that's not imperfect. But in
*  most situations where banks are taken into resolution, it's before a run has ever materialized.
*  If FDIC decided, look, this bank is insolvent on a balance sheet basis, their assets are worth
*  less than their liabilities. And so that executive of that bank, when the FDIC puts it into resolution
*  has already gone down in infamy. It may be that the FDIC has covered a portion of the deposits
*  and a portion of the losses has been borne by uninsured depositors. But failure can happen
*  with the depositors still being honored by the federal government. Of course, that's what happened
*  at SVB ultimately. And you don't need to have a run in order for that to happen. Maybe the FDIC
*  doesn't hop in quite as quickly as you would want them to in a lot of cases. And I think that's true.
*  That was definitely true in the 1980s, although we shored up the law in 1991 to try to get them to do
*  it better. But you don't need a run to have the FDIC wipe out the equity, wipe out the junior
*  creditors, replace the management team and sell the bank off to someone else or put it in resolution.
*  And that's a much less disruptive way than waiting for the run to happen. Because these runs on banks,
*  it's a guillotine, right? And it's herd behavior and the guillotine falls. But it so happens the
*  guillotine is connected up to a nuclear bomb and the nuclear bomb detonates whenever the guillotine
*  comes down. And so the cost of this type of market discipline, this vaunted market discipline that we
*  love and that I love when it comes to equity markets, when it comes to longer term capital
*  markets, bond markets. But when we talk about money markets, demandable and overnight debt,
*  it's such a damaging form of discipline that we really should be willing to go to some length
*  to avoid it. And I'll make just one more small point here, which is, you know, this is what equity
*  capital requirements are also in significant measure about. When you have an FDIC insured
*  institution, yes, it has insured deposits, but it has to maintain equity capital that's subordinated
*  to all those deposits. So the first loss falls on the shareholders. The shareholders are going to
*  go to zero in the event the entity is taken into resolution. And that in itself, the existence of
*  a significant layer of equity capital is the way that we think about usually dealing with
*  moral hazard incentives. So one thing I hear you saying there is that the centrality of moral
*  hazard to this conversation can subtly obscure what we're should be more worried about potentially,
*  which is simply hazard. And if you take your argument, which to this extent, at least I do,
*  that panics are a huge hazard to the entire economy. They seem to destroy semi healthy banks
*  or even very healthy banks. If they get bad enough, they create all kinds of knock on financial
*  problems that the real hazard is not moral, it is systemic or it's financial. And that panic
*  proofing important classes of private money or money like things is a thing that gets your hazard
*  down and the morals are a little bit less important. Look, I think it's a mistake to turn these things
*  into a morality play. And just to be clear, I mean, when I talk about getting rid of the deposit
*  insurance cap, first of all, you have to charge banks and we do charge banks for deposit insurance,
*  we're not charging enough. And we if we were to scrap the cap, we should do it in conjunction
*  with rationalizing and increasing the assessments so the public should be compensated.
*  But on the moral side, I'm talking about prospectively. So Silicon Valley Bank, I mean,
*  I really have pretty mixed feelings about that situation. I mean, what really galls me and always
*  has is sort of changing the rules of the game in the middle, particularly to protect privileged
*  segments of our society. And we're talking about startups, venture capital companies, Silicon Valley,
*  a center of wealth almost without parallel in the history of this country. And so there's a sense
*  of unfairness that we change the rules of the game to bail out a class of citizens who we maybe
*  shouldn't be that all that concerned about in the grand scheme of things. And I agree with that. And
*  my own feeling when I first heard that the bailout had happened was sort of a feeling of disgust.
*  But when we talk about system design, that's not a moral issue about who's blameworthy and who
*  deserves what in my view, I think we should be trying to create a sound money, a sound monetary
*  system, where money is as much a sovereign product as we can make it. And that's what
*  deposit insurance does. And that ultimately redounds to the benefit of the entire public.
*  And we shouldn't let the issues with SVB color our views about how to do policy going forward.
*  So then there's this broader set of ideas about how to make more private money, public money,
*  how to create a system is a little bit more stable and to stay on the banking side as opposed to the
*  sort of financial debt side. You have a proposal for Fed accounts. Tell me a bit about that.
*  Well, this is a proposal with Levman and who you mentioned earlier, who I also wrote this op-ed
*  about deposit insurance with and another scholar, John Crawford at UC Hastings. And so we wrote this
*  a few years ago. And so the idea here was, look, there actually is one class of institutions,
*  one segment of our society that actually has the ability to hold bank accounts at whatever size
*  they want to that are absolutely fully sovereign and non-defaultable, no matter how large the
*  balance is. And that class of institutions is banks themselves, because banks can hold their
*  bank accounts and they do hold their bank accounts at the Federal Reserve. Those are not
*  defaultable no matter how large the balance. I mean, JP Morgan, believe it or not, has half a
*  trillion dollars in its account. I mean, half a trillion dollars in its account at the Fed.
*  And it's not doing credit analysis on the Fed and thinking about whether the Fed will default,
*  because the Fed can't default. There's no scenario in which the Fed defaults on its monetary
*  liabilities. Those are as good as dollar bills from the standpoint of non-defaultability. And so
*  all the banks in the country are able to maintain these accounts at the Fed. They're great. They're
*  non-defaultable no matter how large the balance. They pay very high interest. They offer instant
*  payments. And so the question that the article asks is, well, what's the basis for that special
*  privilege? Why should we restrict this to the banking system? Why shouldn't we let any business,
*  large or small, any individual that wants to bank with the Fed to just have their bank account at
*  the Fed? I mean, the Fed really is a bank. It's actually a set of 12 regional banks, but it's a
*  banking system and it maintains bank accounts for customers. And it has an asset portfolio
*  consisting mostly of treasury and agency securities. And so why shouldn't I be able to have an account
*  there if I want to? I'm legally not allowed to do that right now, but maybe it would solve some
*  problems, including banking the unbanked and underbanked in this country. We have a pretty
*  large category of people who don't have bank accounts. And so this is sort of conceiving
*  of the monetary framework and bank accounts as more of a public good. We could speed up payments.
*  We can improve the transmission of monetary policy. We could reduce the amount of all these
*  private monies that are out there because more of them would just hold accounts at the Fed. And so
*  we'd reduce our instability problems. And so when you start to think about it, there's this whole
*  host of policy problems that can be ameliorated by the Fed account proposal. And so that was,
*  yeah, that was a paper we wrote a few years ago. And do you see that as something that would be
*  significant for financial crises or just a good public service that the government could provide
*  and a way of directly bringing what is a public service money into actual public alignment?
*  Yeah, I think it's both of those things, right? I mean, so it should make crises a lot less likely
*  to the extent you have migration, particularly of large accounts to the Fed. Well, then they're not
*  holding defaulted private money anymore. And you're never going to have the occasion to have a
*  bank run if large balances are there. So part of it is crisis prevention. But part of it is, as you
*  say, it's sort of like thinking of the Fed more like we think of the post office, where it's a big
*  nationwide system that supplies a public good, the post office, which is something that's had
*  an incredibly important role in the history and development of this country. And we could
*  reconceptualize the Fed as something more akin to the post office that offers a really key sort
*  of network or platform service to the whole population. And that seems to get at the
*  underlying philosophical, political shift you're trying to push people to make, which is to,
*  as I understand it, and tell me if this is wrong, to think of this whole class of heavily money-like
*  obligations, objects, whatever you want to call them, as sort of public infrastructure.
*  I mean, if we've learned anything from the past 15, 20 years, it's that whenever anything in this
*  class of debts or monies begins to default, we do step in and we do treat it as public. And
*  maybe a simple way to put it is we've simply not been willing to face up to the implications of
*  that. If we're going to, this is going to be public whenever it is in trouble, but we're then
*  not going to admit it's public whenever it's not in trouble. And so you do then get into this
*  socializing of the losses, privatizing of the gains problem. If we're not willing to let these
*  things fall, then perhaps we actually need to say more of them should be something that the public
*  has actual control over. Yeah. I mean, look, it's control over the money supply. And I think right
*  now we're in a situation where the Fed, you know, the Fed doesn't control the money supply anymore.
*  It's private money that controls the Fed. You know, private money says jump and the Fed says
*  how high. That's true in all these crises. And we're seeing it, you know, tomorrow the Fed has a
*  meeting to decide whether to raise rates. And, you know, inflation is still, you know, significantly
*  higher than they want it to be. We've had some inflation prints that are a bit worrying lately,
*  but all indications are that the Fed is not going to raise rates as high as it otherwise
*  would have to deal with the inflation problem because it's worried about more SVBs, right?
*  It's raised rates and caused problems for a few banks. Who knows what other banks are sort of
*  teetering that it's not aware of and that if a 50 basis point raise in rates would cause other
*  banks to fail, then the Fed doesn't want to do that. And so we have a situation where,
*  you know, private money has started to exert control over what the Fed does and the size of
*  the Fed's balance sheet. And there's all sorts of other problems, I think, that come. I mean,
*  you spoke of privatizing gains and socializing losses. I mean, I think that's exactly right.
*  And there's all sorts of other side effects of what amounts to the privatization of money
*  creation without any public control, but with a public backstop. And it doesn't take a whole
*  lot of reflection to imagine that, you know, a lot of significant trends in our economy in recent
*  decades might be connected up with this from rising, you know, ever rising asset prices
*  in stock markets and bond markets and real estate and all sorts of other areas which boosts
*  inequality. If you think about the growth of finance itself, I mean, if the Fed and the
*  federal government's writing a put option behind the financial system, you should expect it to
*  grow. A backstop should cause the growth of finance and more financialization of the economy.
*  And so I think it's actually bigger than just crises. We have to think about all the side
*  effects of what amounts to privatizing public infrastructure. Let me key into one question of
*  the Fed accounts, Sarah, that has always been interesting to me, because you mentioned a minute
*  ago rising asset prices, rising inequality. One frustration of the Fed, not in the exact moment
*  we're in, but in the post financial crisis moment was it understood us as having then a pretty
*  profound demand problem. And it wanted to get money out into the real economy. It wanted to
*  get money into people's hands in a way they would spend it. But what the Fed can do is shift interest
*  rates and sort of give or backstop money for banks and other, it turns out through quantitative
*  easing, other kinds of financial asset markets. And you'd hear the old Ben Bernanke thing that in
*  this kind of situation, you want to drop money from a helicopter, but they couldn't seem to do
*  that. And so you had this very frustrating situation where they were pumping money into
*  markets that first and foremost benefited people who held a lot of assets. It was great if you were
*  a venture capitalist or you used a lot of debt financing or whatever else. And by the time it
*  reached somebody who didn't hold any assets, it was quite attenuated. I mean, it was a pretty small
*  stimulus for them. And in a world where you had Fed accounts, in theory, at least it seems, a Fed
*  could just say, great, but his account is a hundred bucks in it now that they didn't have before.
*  It is often seemed to me that given the level of economic intervention we have from the Fed,
*  the fact that the nature of their interventions is so focused on the financialized side of the
*  economy and so distant from normal people is an asymmetry that we may not want to have forever.
*  Yeah. I mean, look, the Fed by its very nature acts through financial markets. And as a consequence,
*  they're quite limited in how they can boost economic activity and support demand.
*  And quantitative easing, which you referred to, was buying a bunch of financial assets,
*  which boosts asset prices, lowers risk-free rates, which reprices assets across the economy,
*  reprices them upward. So it's an asset price boosting intervention. And that's not to say
*  it shouldn't be done. I mean, it also helped support employment, which was really what the
*  Fed wanted. I mean, they don't want to boost assets in and of itself. That's not their aim.
*  They're trying to boost employment and juice demand, but they just have a limited set of
*  tools with which to do that. Now on the Fed account side, could the Fed, if we had Fed accounts,
*  just credit money to accounts? And the answer to that is, well, boy, that would actually require
*  a real legislative change. I mean, right now, to get money into JP Morgan's account, what the Fed
*  does is buys assets from the... If it wants to put more reserves in the banking system, in other
*  words, credit the accounts of banks, it's going to go out and buy treasury and agency securities,
*  which is going to sort of mechanically lead to larger balances within the banking system. So
*  the Fed currently doesn't increase the amount of money by just simply crediting the accounts of
*  the banks. And that would be more akin to fiscal policy, but I think Fed accounts would at least
*  open the door to a more efficient way of doing that kind of stimulus.
*  I think it's a good place to end. Also, final question, what are three books you'd recommend
*  to the audience? Three books. So I'm writing something right now on a different topic,
*  which is the structure of our stock markets. I have a book on platforms that I'm writing.
*  And so something I've taken an interest in is stock exchanges and how they've changed. And so
*  the first book will be Michael Lewis's Flash Boys, which is just an incredible... I mean,
*  typically of Michael Lewis, an incredible story about change in our markets and the efforts of
*  some people to try to make the markets work better. So that's the first one. Second,
*  John Gertner's The Idea Factory, which is about Bell Labs. And what I always find fascinating
*  about Bell Labs, it was arguably the most important engine of innovation in the 20th century. And it
*  was a part of the regulated monopoly telephone system. So there's sort of a tension there that
*  I find very interesting, and it's just a great book. And the third would be Lev Menand's Fed
*  Unbound, which is a historical treatment of a lot of the private money issues that we've been
*  talking about and the Fed's role and how the Fed has really been transformed in the past couple
*  of decades. Morgan Ricks, thank you very much. Thank you.
