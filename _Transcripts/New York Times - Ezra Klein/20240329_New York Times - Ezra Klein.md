# From David Duke to Donald Trump: The Rise of ‘Middle-Finger Politics’
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC-Eecmpuyk)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  I think a lot of Democrats and even a lot of Republicans are still a bit agog that Donald
*  Trump is going to be the Republican nominee once again in 2024.
*  After everything he said and done, after what he did during COVID, after everything he did
*  to try and overturn the 2020 election, amidst all the criminal trials and scandals and corruption,
*  all the people he has betrayed and insulted and double crossed, this guy still.
*  It's not like there weren't alternatives.
*  DeSantis pitched himself as Donald Trump without the wild personality.
*  Maybe what people liked about Trump were the positions, but he was being held back by who
*  he was.
*  At least not on the Republican side.
*  That did not turn out to be the problem for Donald Trump.
*  Vivek Rameswamy was a younger, more cheerful, more multicultural spin on the Trumpist theme.
*  Neither of them found any real footing.
*  Both of them were missing something.
*  And I think trying to think about what they were missing is important because there is
*  this endless dialogue about what is the nature of Trump's appeal.
*  And people keep trying to split him into component parts.
*  The policy, the showman, the vibes, the media.
*  It can make Trump seem a little too unique.
*  You sometimes hear people describe his connection with his base in quasi-mystical terms.
*  But I think that's a mistake.
*  I don't think Trump is that unique.
*  And what is interesting to me about him in part is that he puts together a bunch of traits
*  that occur and recur in politicians like him across places and times.
*  You keep having this archetype of the right-wing populist showman, the grinning ethno-nationalist
*  strongman.
*  You see figures like him in other countries.
*  Bolsonaro in Brazil is a lot like Trump.
*  Berlusconi in Italy had a lot of consonances with Trump.
*  Boris Johnson in the UK.
*  But you've also seen a lineage of figures like him in our country.
*  We have a tendency to narrativize politics and campaigns around candidates, around what
*  politicians are offering.
*  We have more trouble talking about what it is that voters want.
*  One way of thinking about this is we're better talking about supply in politics than about
*  demand.
*  But there has long been demand for a right-wing populist showman in the United States.
*  The demand has been at times unmet.
*  It has been at times suppressed.
*  These people were not given a candidate to vote for in a two-party system.
*  But it never went away.
*  Perhaps it will never go away.
*  John Gans is the author of the excellent substack newsletter Unpopular Front.
*  In June, he's publishing When the Clock Broke, Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked
*  Up in the Early 1990s.
*  You can pre-order that now.
*  And he tells this fascinating shadow story of the 1990s.
*  We think now about this much more consensus-oriented politics, Bill Clinton, I mean sex scandals,
*  but it's this time of peace and prosperity.
*  But if you look closely, if you look at the edges, particularly the edges of the Republican
*  Party, something else was pulsing in our politics, growing, gaining strength.
*  You look at David Duke.
*  You look at Pat Buchanan.
*  These politicians who even then were rising to meet it.
*  And so it is worth looking closely at them, what they tried to do, the kind of response
*  they got, and at Trump, who was watching them closely, who, as you'll hear, was very aware
*  of their efforts, who really learned something.
*  As always, my email, the show's email, for feedback, for guest suggestions, for thoughts,
*  Ezra Klein show at nytimes.com.
*  Jon Gans, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks so much for having me.
*  So your book and your work on the 90s begins with David Duke.
*  So who is he and why is he your launching point?
*  Well, David Duke was a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
*  He was a neo-Nazi.
*  And despite his sordid past, he did quite well, especially among white voters.
*  He ran explicitly against the leadership of the Republican Party and beat them.
*  So Reagan, who was immensely popular in Louisiana among Republicans, among everybody in Louisiana,
*  ran radio ads against him.
*  The entire RNC kind of went to war against him.
*  There was a huge concerted effort by Republicans and by really the entire political establishment
*  to stop him.
*  And he said, these people are outsiders telling you people how to vote.
*  I am a populist.
*  I represent the forgotten white man.
*  And this political establishment doesn't really understand you anymore.
*  And he was able, that message resonated with people.
*  And the concerted attack of the Republican establishment on him failed.
*  This excited a lot of people.
*  And then he was a candidate for the governorship of Louisiana and gave the political establishment
*  quite a scare in late 1991.
*  So what then was Duke's platform?
*  I mean, when you look at the issues and his message, what was he really running on?
*  Duke's message, strangely enough, was not all that different from conservative Republicans
*  at the time.
*  He was against welfare.
*  He was concerned about crime.
*  He was against affirmative action.
*  He was a little bit more explicit about the racial subtext it was for other Republicans.
*  For him, it was more text.
*  And his crowds plainly understood that and were very excited by it.
*  But it seems like it was text for him in an interesting way.
*  He gets to something that becomes very important, I think, in Republican Party politics right
*  around then and very much now is important, which is that you, the white Christian people,
*  are now the embattled minority.
*  And there was a moment in the debate in that governor's race where he's asked if he repudiates
*  his neo-Nazi past.
*  And you can hear him make that turn.
*  As a newfound Christian, a born again, are you here willing now to apologize to the people,
*  the minorities of this state whom you have so dastardly insulted, sir?
*  Mr. Duke, you have 30 seconds.
*  30 seconds?
*  Of course I apologize for things that I've said that have been intolerant and improper.
*  Do you repudiate the Klan and the neo-Nazi?
*  Any other racist organization or intolerant organization that exists in the state or this
*  country, I think we've all got to work together.
*  But you don't make up for past discrimination by putting new discrimination on people with
*  these affirmative action programs and policies.
*  And there's a lot of racism that exists in all communities, not just the white community.
*  And then here's another clip of Duke at a rally the following year.
*  This is now when he's running for president.
*  You know, the government would not tolerate an all-white scholarship program.
*  You know, we can have a Miss Black America, can't we?
*  But you try having a Miss White America in this country and see what they're hiding.
*  You know, the problem, ladies and gentlemen, is not my background.
*  The problem they find with David Duke is that I say things nobody else will say in American
*  politics, things that must be said.
*  One thing I think you hear there is there is an essential quality of slipperiness to
*  these guys.
*  There's always this question of on what level are they talking?
*  What is the message that they are saying explicitly?
*  And what is the message that they are communicating to the people who know that the thing they
*  really believe is a thing you're not really allowed to say?
*  And I think they have different strategies for this.
*  With Duke, strangely, I think it took a form of almost gentility.
*  He could rely on his neo-Nazi past, his Ku Klux Klan past, to send one message.
*  And then he would be telling you, I'm not a racist.
*  I just care about equality.
*  With some other figures, more modern figures, maybe, it takes the form of this edgelord
*  humor.
*  Oh, I'm just joking.
*  You're just humorless.
*  But there is so often among these right-wing populists, this shimmering quality of meaning.
*  Are they saying it or are they not saying it?
*  And I'm curious why you think that recurs so often.
*  Yes, there's a certain slipperiness to him for sure because he lied an enormous amount.
*  I think a part of it is being a little naughty and obscene and walking right up to the line
*  and sometimes going beyond it.
*  And I think that that's a huge part of it, which is just like, these people are stopping
*  your enjoyment.
*  They're somehow preventing you from living the life, saying the things that you really
*  want to say and would make you feel good.
*  The kind of winking or shimmering you're talking about where there's a certain excitement in
*  the fact that he represents something unacceptable and represents something that's frightening
*  and disconcerting to the people that his constituents want to frighten and disconcert.
*  Politics is about when you want to get certain things done, you need the ideas to be out
*  there so you have to push them out into the open somehow.
*  Some of it's just political rhetoric, which is just saying stuff.
*  I want to pick up on that word excitement.
*  There is a kind of electric quality to being part of one of these insurgency campaigns.
*  Particularly when you're dealing with these populists, you have this sort of giant middle
*  finger energy of these campaigns.
*  It's like you're telling off the liberal establishment, you're telling off the media establishment,
*  you're telling off the Republican establishment.
*  And there's a clip I want to play here of Duke at that 1992 rally, which captures some
*  of that energy and language that sounds very familiar right now.
*  And if we don't watch out for our country, first and foremost, we will lose our nation.
*  The only people who are really pushing for this new world order, who are they really?
*  A few of the trilaterals, a few of the CFR people, a few of the international conglomerates,
*  international financial concerns, they have no allegiance to America.
*  They have a worldwide network of money.
*  All they care about is their bottom line.
*  Well, I don't want to part of a new world order where Americans lose their sovereignty
*  and their rights and their freedoms.
*  And that's where we're going.
*  I say it's time to put America first in this world.
*  What is that kind of latent energy, that energy that's not left right, but just a middle finger
*  to sort of the entirety of the power structure?
*  I think basically one of the biggest energies or features of American politics that, as
*  you said, is not left, right or center, and it's not particularly ideological, is a sense
*  among a lot of people of being extremely alienated from the political establishment, feeling
*  that their representatives don't in fact represent them, and that the political establishment,
*  the media universities are corrupt.
*  As liberals, we might respond and say, well, they're not really corrupt because we can
*  point to statistics.
*  In America, there's not really much corruption.
*  The word corruption implies something broader than just breaking the law.
*  It's a sense that they're self-dealing, that they don't have the interests of their constituents
*  that they should have at heart, and that they are unresponsive.
*  And isn't there something to that feeling?
*  Yeah, unfortunately there is.
*  I think that there is a little bit of a crisis in this country that as we get bigger, as
*  the country gets more complicated, these institutions are not particularly responsive
*  to people, particularly people who are not educated.
*  They are not controlled by them.
*  They don't necessarily respond to their concerns and interests, sometimes for good reason.
*  But yes, there is a sense among people that these institutions are alien, and that's true.
*  When you say we're going through a crisis around this, I do question that a little bit.
*  And I question it in this way, that is there ever a time when the dynamic being described
*  here is not true?
*  So the political scientist Larry Bartels distinguishes between this idea of populist waves and populist
*  reservoirs, that often when one of these guys wins, you're like, well, there's a big populist
*  wave sweeping the world.
*  But there's also a way of looking at this, that it's a reservoir, this feeling is always
*  there.
*  There are always insiders and outsiders, always elites and people who are not the elite, always
*  institutions that you can't penetrate, always a rural urban divide.
*  And things happen at different moments, often around changes in media structures and communication
*  structures that make it harder for elites to suppress that dynamic, right?
*  Makes it harder for the reservoir to get tapped.
*  But that it's always there.
*  And it's a reason, I mean, we're starting in the 90s here, the 80s, I guess, with Duke,
*  but you can go backwards.
*  I mean, you go to George Wallace, you could talk about Huey Long, you can look at other
*  countries, you can look at Mussolini.
*  I think sometimes it tends to be very present focused.
*  For sure.
*  I think that's a fair point.
*  And I think that the idea of a reservoir is interesting.
*  Obviously, populism is a, you know, even before the literal populist movement, as a style
*  has a very long history in American politics, as a perennial part of American politics.
*  I do believe under certain conditions, people's perception of the political establishment's
*  to their concerns, which can be not necessarily appear rational, becomes more intense.
*  You see this in the early 90s, when the sort of deleterious effects of Reaganomics become
*  clear and a lot of people's lives are affected negatively by the changes in the economy,
*  the Cold War breaks down.
*  And that has both an economic aspect and an ideological aspect because its orientation
*  point for American politics goes away.
*  And I think that there is a sense among some of the people that I research and talk about
*  that we've done the work of ending the Soviet Union.
*  Now it's time to get the commies at home.
*  So yeah, I think there is a constant hum.
*  And there are also people who would just kind of have these politics more ideologically
*  and are always trying to create a movement.
*  But I think that under certain conditions, that comes to the surface more than others.
*  So in the end, what happens to the Duke campaign in Louisiana?
*  Duke loses by a pretty big margin.
*  There's a big concerted effort.
*  The business community turns against them.
*  They said, look, this guy becomes governor economically, we're going to be in tough shape
*  because no one's going to want to do business with us.
*  A huge black vote came out to knock him out.
*  But what people noticed and was remarkable and maybe his goal in a way was that he got
*  55% of the white vote in Louisiana, which was pretty remarkable.
*  There are deeper roots of racist politics in the South, of course, but it was pretty
*  remarkable at that late date for a lot of people that this neo-Nazi won 55% of the white vote.
*  So after Duke loses this libertarian figure, Murray Rothbard, writes an essay called Right-Wing
*  Populism that takes as its launching point Duke's loss.
*  And it's very fascinating to read today and very important to your story.
*  So can you explain who Rothbard was and what you found significant in the essay?
*  So Murray Rothbard for most of his career was a little bit of a fringe figure on the right.
*  He's a libertarian.
*  He's an extreme free marketer.
*  He was almost an isolationist.
*  He was too much of a free marketer for the national review set.
*  They made fun of him wanting to privatize lighthouses.
*  He never forgot that.
*  He was opposed to military spending because he believed it built up the welfare warfare state.
*  He was a little bit homeless politically for a lot of his life.
*  And he associated himself with the old right, the pre-war right of Lindbergh,
*  isolationism, America first.
*  He thought this was the true tradition.
*  And he saw in Duke a kind of return of that and a way to unseat the conservative and
*  Republican establishment that had sort of shunted him to the side.
*  So I had not read the essay until you drew my attention to it.
*  And as I read it, two things about it struck me as important.
*  And the first is this structural argument it makes.
*  Rothbard says right at the beginning that David Duke is only defeated by,
*  a massive campaign of hysteria, of fear and hate,
*  orchestrated by all wings of the ruling elite from official right to left.
*  And he goes on to say that,
*  the basic right wing populist insight is that we live in a status country and a status world
*  dominated by a ruling elite consisting of a coalition of big government,
*  big business and various influential special interest groups.
*  So tell me about that basic right wing populist insight.
*  Well, I think that that right wing populist insight maps very closely onto the feeling.
*  I mean, it's more ideological, but it maps very easily onto the sentiment that we talked about
*  earlier about a sense of alienation from the political establishment.
*  It's not trying to necessarily go for small government anymore as traditional conservatives
*  wanted to do, but rather grab the reins of power and smash up the things that we don't like.
*  This always feels to me like the thing that separates various kinds of populisms,
*  but particularly right wing populism in this case, which is the fact that the Republican
*  Party is the enemy. At least the Republican Party before you take it over, sometimes after you
*  take it over too. But this also makes it very hard to govern in coalition with the Republican
*  Party. I mean, I think you see this in the way that more right wing populist House Republicans
*  keep deposing Republican speakers. You are at war with what you might otherwise understand
*  as your own political home. Absolutely. I think that that's a
*  contradiction that's sort of hard to square and makes populism hard. It's an effective political
*  strategy or rhetoric, but as a system of government, sometimes obviously has problems.
*  But yeah, the idea of Rothbard and the people around him was that they needed to take
*  attack and take over the Republican Party. Obviously in 2015-16, Trump's candidacy
*  was the realization of this, which was an attack on the Republican establishment from a figure
*  outside. He's not part of the leadership of the Republican Party. He very explicitly comes as
*  an outsider and says, these people are idiots. They don't know what they're doing. They've been
*  constantly selling you out. And he immediately electrifies Republicans. So is Rothbard in this
*  essay in this moment trying to create something new, this new thing of right wing populism,
*  or does he understand himself as describing something old?
*  I think he understands himself as describing something old. So in this essay, one of the big
*  inspirations for the strategy that he's devising or articulating here is Joe McCarthy. So many
*  conservatives and centrist liberals or right leaning liberals looked at McCarthy and said,
*  well, we don't like communism. And we're worried about this. And we're cold warriors.
*  But he's so crude. He's so demagogic. If it was only put nicer. And Rothbard says, no,
*  you don't get it. The form, the means that he used this populist attack on the establishment,
*  exactly the point. That's what was effective about it. He scared the living shit out of them.
*  And that's what I like about it. And it was exciting and fun for people. And he talks about
*  something called, and I think that this is really interesting to think about in terms of Trump.
*  He came up with this in a memo when he was in the 1950s when he was working for a right wing
*  think tank. He called it the popular short circuit, a short circuit. The memo was called
*  in defense of demagogues. We need this demagogue figure to go around the mediating institutions
*  and plug directly into the population that feels the sense of alienation and go straight to them
*  and get them excited and rouse them. And I think that, you know, obviously,
*  Trump resonates with that a lot. Yeah. I mean, this is the other piece of the Rothbard essay
*  that I'm interested in. This idea that the form and the content are fused. He says you need somebody
*  who can quote, go over the heads of the media and political elites to reach the working class
*  directly. And that that requires quote, this inspiring and charismatic political leadership.
*  One of the motivations for this conversation for me is I've been interested for a while about
*  why when you see these figures in different eras and in different countries, is the personality so
*  often similar? We'll talk about Buchanan, but Trump, you think about Berlusconi in Italy,
*  you think about Bolsonaro in Brazil. I kind of keep going down a list of these people. They often
*  come out of media. Mussolini, of course, comes out of the media. And there's often this like
*  Barnum and Bailey quality to them. They're outrageous. They're showmen. And one sort of
*  popular argument among liberals is that these things actually do not need to be connected. So
*  my friend Matt Iglesias at SUBSTAC had this argument about Trump a few weeks ago, where he says,
*  look, the thing about Trump is that he was moderating on Medicare, on social security,
*  in a way you could add into that the Iraq war. Yeah. But he was moving to the right on immigration.
*  And this is actually a sort of popular way to shift the valence, the ideological valence of the
*  Republican Party. And it's just his sort of vile, crazy persona that kept that from being
*  overwhelmingly effective. And maybe that's true, right? If you could push somebody like that
*  through the primary and just put them up like Mitt Romney with a different position on Medicare,
*  maybe he wins the election. I don't know. But the fact that you always have this combination
*  of characteristics connected to each other makes me believe there's something about them that need
*  each other. And Rothbard here sort of offers one answer to it at least, which is that if you are
*  going to be doing the populist thing, you can't rely on any institutional support. And so you need
*  someone who is so electric from a mass media perspective, that it sort of overwhelms the
*  system's defenses and creates a sort of direct connection to the voter. Yeah. I think that there
*  is no separating form and content, as you said, that the figure has to represent the middle finger
*  in order to be effective and get the constituency behind them. I think that Matt is right in the
*  sense that that creates weaknesses too. It builds a constituency. It alienates a lot of other people
*  who might otherwise be amenable to those sorts of things. But I don't think it works without
*  the theatrical, outrageous parts of it. And I think that that is part of the reason why people
*  gravitate towards it. I think you could speak to people, and they may not have very clear ideas
*  about any given policy issue. And yet what they do believe is that the political establishment
*  sucks and they like somebody who tells them to fuck off. Yeah. I mean, political scientists will
*  tell you, I mean, this is an old finding, that the percentage of voters who have what they call an
*  ideological relationship to politics, it's a fraction. Right. Like it's like nobody.
*  Right. And there is this demand for a populist right figure. In American politics,
*  in other countries politics, it recurs across time and place. I think it's very important to
*  understand that demand is maybe going up and down, but always there at some level, even when it is
*  not being met. But the thing that certainly in America, the Republican party is always trying
*  to do is control that demand, harness its energy, harness its votes, but for what it wants to do.
*  For Murray Rothbard's libertarian agenda, for Paul Ryan's and the Tea Party is really an effort,
*  but it really wants to privatize Medicare. In a way, Donald Trump, I think, understands that
*  energy really well because he understands that it does want things. I think specifically it does
*  want things around immigration and national character. But when I look at populist right
*  voters, they don't want Medicare gone. They don't want the social security gone. They maybe want it
*  just to be for them. The form does seem as or more important than the content. In fact,
*  the content seems very malleable and one of Trump's signal characteristics as a political figure
*  is the malleability of his content, how much it will change even rally to rally or even within
*  a single rally. But the energy is actually about this sort of middle finger politics
*  is I think a much more honest sense of it than where the Republican party has often been and
*  why the Republican party keeps getting overwhelmed by it because they want to
*  harness it to a policy agenda that it does not share and often doesn't even care about.
*  No, and it's even sometimes opposed to and that goes back to Duke's campaign because he ran against
*  the kind of conservative Democrat turned Republican who was very austerity focused. This is what Trump
*  realizes, unconsciously or consciously, there's not a big constituency for some of the things that
*  Republicans are really interested in like cutting Medicare and stuff like that. Even
*  increasingly interventionism abroad and stuff like that. And then there's a much broader
*  constituency of people who have right-wing instincts but don't have very particular
*  views about those issues. So yeah, I completely agree with what you're saying.
*  So I want to move here to Pat Buchanan, who I think of as the truest forerunner to Donald Trump.
*  For people who don't know him, who is he and how does he enter this story for you?
*  Pat Buchanan is and was, I suppose, one of the most prominent conservatives in America. He was
*  a protege in a way of William Buckley. He was part of the early conservative movement. He
*  differed from conservatives in that he went to work in the Nixon administration, which was viewed
*  by conservatives as being centrist, pragmatic, not ideological enough. But Buchanan saw something in
*  Nixon, the figure that he had this sort of populist energy. He represented forgotten Americans. So
*  Nixon's presidency had a very big symbolic importance for Buchanan. And he viewed Watergate
*  as a kind of coup by the establishment against this kind of salt of the earth, middle American
*  populism that Nixon represented. He worked in the Reagan administration as communications director.
*  And he said after that experience, the biggest vacuum in American politics is to the right of
*  Ronald Reagan. And he sort of was on a mission to push American politics to the right.
*  I've been trying to decide what order to go on with Buchanan because there's so much to say about
*  him. He's actually so overdue for a huge biography. But maybe start here. What is his relationship
*  in the story to David Duke? Well, Pat Buchanan was among a number of people on the right who looked
*  at David Duke's candidacy and found it very interesting and saw something hopeful there,
*  as if it was an indication that their time had come. What's the evidence of that? The evidence
*  of that is that he wrote it. He said, basically, Republicans ought to look at David Duke is doing
*  and kind of appropriate some of his program, like we did with George Wallace. And he also saw David
*  Duke's candidacy as the point at which his own candidacy for president might make sense.
*  David Duke started to get a lot of attention outside of Louisiana as well. He looked as if
*  there was some sort of interest in the rest of the country. And Buchanan looked at this being a
*  seasoned political insider who had spent so much time in Washington and said, ah, there's something
*  going on. I'm going to try to ride this wave as well. David Duke actually boasted about that,
*  right? We have a clip of him from the same 1992 rally we played earlier, saying, look at the
*  effect I'm having. Look at Pat Buchanan. I noticed that more and more of my issues
*  are now becoming the issues of other candidates. And I really like Patrick Buchanan, but I know
*  where he got his ideas to run for politics using my issues. I know where they came from. He did a
*  column about four years ago after I ran for the House of Representatives in Louisiana. And he said
*  that David Duke was showing the Republican Party the way. And then it's weird. On the other side,
*  you have Buchanan then saying that David Duke was really the one copying him.
*  Well, he says both. Pat Buchanan at one point says, we ought to copy David Duke. And then when they
*  try to connect David Duke to Pat Buchanan, Pat Buchanan goes on TV and he says, no, he's been
*  copying me. I think he's been reading my old columns. I mean, I think that they mirrored each
*  other in a lot of different ways. But I would say that he looked at Duke as a signal of when to
*  sort of launch his campaign for sure. I want to give people a sense for what this felt and
*  sounded like. I have a few clips here, but let's play the first one from Buchanan's 1992 campaign
*  announcement. So today we call for a new patriotism where Americans begin to put the needs of
*  Americans first. For a new nationalism where in every negotiation, be it arms control or trade,
*  the American side seeks advantage and victory for the United States. And the people of this
*  country need to recapture our capital city of Washington from lobbyists and registered agents
*  of foreign powers who are hired to look out for everybody and everything except the national
*  interests of the United States. I mean, that sounds pretty damn familiar right now. So when
*  you're talking about who might sue whom for copyright infringement, but you may have this,
*  well, was Donald Trump paying attention to any of this? So there's this other clip I want to show
*  you here, which we found. This is also from the 92 election. And I find it completely astonishing.
*  It's like a Rosetta stone to this whole era. So this is Donald Trump on Larry King talking about
*  the possibility of Buchanan running and talking about David Duke. There's a tremendous amount of
*  hostility in the United States. Anger. It's anger. I mean, that's an anger vote. That's people are
*  angry about what's happened. People are angry about the jobs. If David Duke runs, David Duke is going
*  to get a lot of votes, whether that be good or bad. David Duke is going to get a lot of votes.
*  Pat Buchanan, who really has many of the same theories, except it's in a better package,
*  Pat Buchanan is going to take a lot of votes away from George Bush. So if you have these two guys
*  running or even one of them running, I think George Bush could be in big trouble. I mean,
*  this is over 30 years ago and Trump sees it. He sees it all really clearly. And he even
*  understands the sort of lineage happening. He's almost complimentary about Buchanan as this better
*  package of this thing that he understands to be politically potent, but maybe a little bit too far
*  for the American people. Trump recently mentioned Pat Buchanan and he said, great guy, conservative
*  guy, great guy. And Buchanan said, Trump is the last shot for my ideas or these kinds of ideas.
*  Yeah, I think that he's a precursor to Trump in many, many ways. Buchanan, although there is a,
*  I hope I can say this, is a thuggish side to him. He is an educated man and articulate. He quotes
*  poetry in his speeches. And in fact, some of his allies on the populist right kind of thought he
*  was too much of a highbrow still. And that sort of contributed to the fact that he didn't really
*  take root and also still too in love with the Republican party, which had been his home and
*  still too in love with the conservative movement that had been his home. But Buchanan is interesting
*  too because he's a border crosser. Yeah. So Buchanan is a genuine extremist. I think it is fair
*  to say. I mean, William F. Buckley, the editor of national review at some point does this huge,
*  long essay trying to decide if Pat Buchanan is an anti-Semite. So there's that, but at the same time,
*  Buchanan, while he's a strange conservative revanchist, he's also kind of a media darling.
*  He's like the in-house paleo conservative, true conservative of the McLaughlin group back then.
*  He eventually becomes a host of crossfire when that show launches, the conservative side of the
*  initial crossfire. He becomes the in-house conservative later on MSNBC. Sure. Joining us
*  now is my MSNBC political colleague, Pat Buchanan. Pat, it's been far too long since you've been on
*  the show. Nice to see you. Good to see you. When Rachel Maddow's show launches, there is a segment
*  called It's Pat, where she argues with Pat Buchanan like he's her racist uncle who she used with
*  affection. Pat, I think that by advocating that the Republican party try to stir up racial animus
*  among white voters here, you're dating yourself. I say, you know, I think they ought to do,
*  they ought to defend the legitimate rights of white working class folks who are the victims of
*  discrimination because that's the right thing to do. Buchanan understood something about the media
*  the others didn't, about the ability to use the fact that it didn't like people like him, but
*  somehow needed people like him at the same time. Pat Buchanan, MSNBC political analyst, I'm very
*  sorry that we're out of time. It's nice to have you back on the show, Pat. Thanks. I've enjoyed it,
*  and as I always do, Rachel. We will be right back. Yes, that's right. He was very good at being the
*  house conservative on TV shows, but was extreme, as you mentioned. But also, people did like him.
*  He was very friendly and polite and nice and all of his hosts that he worked with, all the liberals
*  that he worked with, they said, oh, he's such a wonderful man. I mean, he, throughout his career,
*  evinced his very anti-Semitic ideas. A lot of his Jewish colleagues said, oh, he would never. He's
*  such a darling. He's always been so nice to me. I think he could use a lot of charm. Politicians
*  need to be able to do this and turn on the charm when he needed to and make people feel like he
*  wasn't so scary, which I think Trump does in a different way. I think he was really very canny.
*  This is the era of the emergence of cable news. He just knew how to do that so well,
*  to be on a panel show, to be on a talk show, to give great sound bites. Again, he's a little bit
*  more articulate in a way than Trump, but yes, his use of the media is quite impressive.
*  This goes a little bit to the Rothbard thing of recognizing that you need somebody who can,
*  in a way, go around the institutions. But I think it gets at the way the Rothbard thing was wrong.
*  And something Buchanan understands that Trump later really understands, which is that you don't
*  need to get around the institutions. You need to go through the institutions. There's actually a
*  kind of way you can exploit them. If you are sufficiently outrageous, if you are good copy.
*  There's a famous Les Moonves quote where he's the head of CBS and he says,
*  Donald Trump may not be good for the nation, but pretty good for CBS. And Buchanan has this quality
*  a little bit too, where on the one hand you read the thing he's saying and these are the very
*  institutions that are destroying the entire country. And on the other hand, he's a member
*  in good standing of all of them collecting a paycheck from all of them. And this ability to
*  be in and out of it at the same time, and Trump understood and still understands a kind of essential,
*  there does not need to be a affection for there to be a unity of interest.
*  Oh, absolutely. I think that back when Rothbard wrote that essay, he was talking about newspapers
*  and he thought already, he talks about how McCarthy was using TV. I think it's different
*  forms of media are more amenable to this quote unquote short circuit, because they're not,
*  they have less editorial control essentially. And they're based on ratings and competition.
*  Ratings and competition. Yeah, they build on the need for commercial advantage and that's
*  based on showmanship and theatricality, something that Trump is obviously amazing at. And Buchanan
*  had some very good skill at, but he was a news guy. He wasn't as funny. He wasn't as outrageous.
*  Trump is an entertainer. Television news is entertainment, but it's entertainment for
*  the types of people who watch TV news. There are types of people who don't watch the news.
*  And I think Trump is entertaining for people who don't watch the news as well.
*  I want to talk too about Buchanan's ideological content. So I don't remember if I read this book
*  when Trump was running in 2016 or after he won, but I went back and read this book Buchanan
*  published in 2002 called the death of the West. So I'm going to read you a couple of quotes that
*  I highlighted. So here's one Buchanan writes in 1960, only 16 million Americans did not trace
*  their ancestors to Europe. Today, the number is 80 million. No nation has ever undergone so rapid
*  and radical a transformation. He then goes global in the analysis writing quote, in 1960, people of
*  European ancestry were one fourth of the world's population. In 2000, they were one six in 2050.
*  They will be one 10th. These are the statistics of a vanishing race. So this is publishing in 2002,
*  George W. Bush's president, but this is not the conservatism of George W. Bush. This is not exactly
*  a policy agenda, but it is worried about something much more fundamental. Yeah, Buchanan as most of
*  these people that we've discussed have a racial consciousness. What they're worried about is
*  demographic decline of white people, both economically in turn and sheer numbers. They believe that the
*  core of American civilization is people of white European descent. And the country is no longer
*  America. If those are not the dominant people in the country. I mean, David Duke was a neo Nazi.
*  So the racism is at the core at the very core of how he thinks. So I think that there's no escaping
*  it. And Buchanan, obviously, I'll just flat out say it is a racist and anti-Semite. It's difficult
*  to argue otherwise at this point. I think a lot of times when I get into arguments about how extreme
*  Trump is or what his politics are, I always go back and I'm like, well, who got excited about it?
*  Who immediately when he appeared on the scene, their ears perked up. And it was a lot of people
*  from previously quite marginalized streams of politics, white supremacists, neo Nazis, etc.
*  I mean, Buchanan is in that world a little bit or a lot of it. And they say, finally, this is our
*  breakthrough. Finally, someone's talking like us and is speaking to our concerns. Trump's appearance
*  in the political scene was a rapturous event for them a breakthrough. I want to get another thing
*  Buchanan is good at doing here because he connects that that sort of blood and soil ethnic nationalism.
*  Sure. Then to this other thing that that is happening, it is a very powerful and much more,
*  I think, ideologically normalized sense, which is just the sense of disorientation
*  about our society is changing. So he writes here again in this death of the west book,
*  millions have begun to feel like strangers in their own land. They were coil from a popular
*  culture that is saturated with raw sex and trumpets, hedonistic values. They see old holidays
*  disappear and old heroes degraded. They see the art and artifacts of a glorious past removed from
*  their museums and replaced by the depressing, the ugly, the abstract, the anti-American.
*  They watch as books they cherished disappear from the schools they attended to be replaced
*  by authors and titles that they've never heard of. The moral code that they were raised to live by
*  has been overthrown. The culture they grew up with is dying inside the country they grew up in.
*  And that just feels, I mean, that just is the things people are writing now about
*  absoluteness, about DEI, about changes in the schools just written in 2002 in a slightly
*  different context. Absolutely. I mean, it's the same message. The difference is that now
*  a lot of conservatives would not have associated themselves with Buchanan's brand, right?
*  And Trump has been this breakthrough and now pretty much every right winger in good standing
*  says similar sorts of things. I want to get at why this ripens. Yeah. So Duke fails and fails
*  badly. Buchanan also fails. He runs in 1992. He does not win. George J. B. Bush is a nominee.
*  He runs in 1996. He does not win. And he kind of settles into senescence, as I mentioned before,
*  as not even the big conservative on Fox News. He's a conservative at MSNBC. Right. Like I used to
*  go on Morning Joe with that guy. Right. Like that actually happened in my life. It's weird. And
*  it doesn't work for him. No. Why does Trump succeed where these figures fail?
*  Partially, it's his style as a showman and his skills that he got from that. I think Trump,
*  I like to say he's a synthesis, right? He's a synthesis of different aspects of American
*  politics and culture, one of which is obviously the entertainment industry. He comes from the
*  world of tabloids. He comes from the world of reality TV show. This is where a lot of people
*  know him from. And this is where he gets his showmanship. I think it's that he was more
*  unambiguously an attack on the establishment and couldn't be said, oh, this guy's been hanging
*  around with these people for a very long time. He's been hanging around with rich people in
*  this country for a very long time. But he was unambiguously an attack on the establishment.
*  He also was no holds barred in his rhetoric and it really excited people. His speeches,
*  the way his way of talking was fun. The way that Rothbard talks about this, he says, it's got to be
*  rousing, energetic, charismatic. I think the sheer charisma that he had was part of it.
*  His New York accent conveys a kind of folksy, but highly intelligent, cunning thing to people.
*  And he sounds like he knows what he's talking about. He is a little bit of a gangster.
*  So I think the archetype of gangsters from movies, which we've as being, you know,
*  they're bad, but they're good. They're kind of fun. They know how to get things done.
*  There's no bullshit with them. You know, we have this very affectionate almost picture of gangsters
*  in American culture, and he's a gangster in a certain way. He's a little bit of a mobster.
*  McCann doesn't sound like that. He sounds pretty square. So I think that that's a huge part of it.
*  And he comes from this kind of semi-legitimate family business where it provides for people.
*  It does kind of corrupt things and cuts corners. I think that actually really appeals to people.
*  You've written the quote, the social character of Trumpism is crucial to understanding him.
*  What do you mean by that?
*  You know, it's strange to think about this, but I think Trump is a family values candidate.
*  And I think that a lot of liberals look at him and say, well, he's such a horrible father,
*  and he's got all these divorces, all these children. Yeah. And how could they be so
*  critical? They used to talk about family values. So now look at Trump. Trump's family looks like a
*  lot of American families. There's divorces. There's lots of extra kids. He might not like his ex-wife
*  very much. He might not even really like the kids that much. And he still is able somehow to provide
*  for them and look like a big strong guy. I think that he represents the kind of family values
*  that are in some ways new because of the change of the family structure because of divorce and
*  someone's very old and patriarchal. He's big daddy. He's the head of the clan, the CLN.
*  I think that appeals to a lot of Americans who want to take care of their families in the same
*  way. Their families writ large. There's another thing that I want to bring in here, and I always
*  find this genuinely tricky to talk about among liberals. David Duke, not a fun guy. You don't
*  want David Duke at a party. No. Pat Buchanan, not a fun guy. Not really. I don't think you'd want
*  Pat Buchanan to party. I've met him. He's fine. Well, maybe not from my perspective. I know where
*  you're going. I think it is very hard for liberals to admit that within Trumpism, there is a joyousness.
*  Oh, there's absolutely an enormous amount of enjoyment in it. It's an enormous amount of fun.
*  People follow him on the road. You got merch, right? You got these fun hats. Yeah. Another thing
*  that's been brought up intelligently about Trump is professional wrestling. I think that, yeah,
*  it's an enormous amount of fun to go to those rallies for a lot of people. He is funny. Let's
*  face it. I remember I had Thanksgiving with my family, all very nice upper middle class liberals.
*  I said Trump was funny. Oh, no, he's not funny. He's not funny. I don't think he's funny. Come on,
*  give me a break. He can be very funny. Let me pick up on that, though, because I do think this gets
*  to something real and something Trump picks up on well, that Buchanan picks up on well.
*  I used to think about the efforts to create a Fox News of the left, and it never took, ever,
*  because liberals did not want a thing that felt like Fox News. What took was John Stewart and
*  Stephen Colbert and Rachel Maddow. When you think about the comedy on the right and the comedy on
*  the left, when you think about the attacks on the right and the attacks on the left, as you were
*  saying, the attack on the right is that you're not a real American, right? That's what Bill O'Reilly
*  was always about. The attack on the left is you're dumb. The left's humor is irony, and the
*  right's humor is the insult comic. Trump is fundamentally an insult comic. Barack Obama
*  actually is quite funny, but he's an ironist. I always talk about this sort of empathic chasm
*  around Trump. I empathically cannot actually embody finding Trump appealing. I do not find
*  the guy appealing. I do think one of the things here is that it is sometimes hard for the liberals
*  to appreciate, given how horrifying many of the things Trump says happen to be, that there's a
*  deep enjoyment to him if you're his audience. Oh, sure. Absolutely. I have to tell you,
*  I don't know if I should admit this to such a huge audience, I do sometimes get it because
*  I like gangster movies. I think that shit is funny. I think that the way they express themselves is
*  very appealing. There's a certain type of wise guy masculinity of Trump, which I do think is
*  entertaining. I wouldn't say I could identify with it, but I get the appeal for sure. It's the same
*  reason why we like Tony Soprano and stuff like that. There's something atavistic about it.
*  There's something stupid. You know it's kind of stupid, but there is a kick that's there.
*  I want to go back here to this idea of the middle finger politics, because this feels to me like the
*  trap liberals ran with Trump. That part of what makes him funny is how outraged he makes them.
*  Oh, for sure. That the energy is actually unleashed in the interaction. It is, I have a little kid.
*  What is the first joke little kids tell? It is some kind of complete nonsensical setup,
*  and then the joke is poop. The absolute er-joke is a little bit of shock value.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Right? Like, can you believe I just said that? Can you believe we're saying that together?
*  Yeah.
*  At a much more kind of elevated level, a lot of the energy, it seems to me in a Trump rally,
*  when I watch them, is this, can you believe we're doing it together? And then the response, right?
*  If there was never a response, if my kid didn't think I would ever have a response to him saying
*  naughty words, it wouldn't be funny. He doesn't find the word bagel funny, even though it's kind
*  of a funny word to say.
*  Yeah, there has to be a reaction.
*  There has to be a reaction. And that feels like the deep bind, that you're kind of trapped in this
*  interaction with it.
*  Well, yeah, okay. I think Trump's insight and the insight with a lot of these people,
*  and this might be the key populist insight, is that there's something obscene about power,
*  and you have to be able to walk up to the line and go past it. Trump is obscene. He says obscene
*  things and people love it. I do think that this is what happens with the way populist politicians
*  campaign though, which makes it hard to say, oh, just don't react. They do two things. They have a
*  very effective little tactic, which is, well, if they get reacted to, they play off that. And if
*  they don't get reacted to, they take it a little farther and see what happens.
*  So that's the supply side of Donald Trump, the aesthetics of Donald Trump.
*  I'm curious if you think though that there was a change in the reservoir,
*  a ripening also of the issues. When you think about what Buchanan is talking about here and
*  elsewhere, he talks a lot about this change in morals, in culture, in this idea of what equality
*  is and what it means. He talks a lot about how the West is being made to feel that it's racist and
*  everything that is achieved is ill-gotten. Is something also happening as you have Barack
*  Obama who becomes president and very much to the opinion there's no Donald Trump without
*  Barack Obama. How much is also, I mean, the thing Buchanan is a little bit early on,
*  the sense of white people, of Christian people beginning to feel like an embattled minority,
*  whether or not they actually are, has matured to a point that it has become a mass politics
*  from before it was a fractional politics. Absolutely. I like to point this out. How
*  did Trump get started in politics? Right? Birth or ism? What is birth or ism? Obama's not really a
*  citizen. As you're about to see, Donald Trump is not backing away from the firestorm of controversy
*  he ignited this week on The View when he called out the president of the United States about his
*  birth certificate. So there is something very strange going on. He spent a lot of money to keep
*  this out of print. There's something very, very strange going on, a lot of legal fees.
*  Why can't he produce a birth certificate? You've never seen George W. Bush's birth certificate,
*  have you? No, I haven't, but I'm sure he has one and I guarantee he was born here. And I hope that
*  Barack Obama was born here. The core of Donald Trump's entire politics from then until now
*  is certain people, and this is why some people respond to it, is certain people are not really
*  American citizens. What is denying the election? Certain people's votes. The election is stolen.
*  Yeah, well, no, it's just that certain people's votes don't really count and aren't real. So the
*  core of Trump is narrowing the idea of American citizenship down to a certain type of person,
*  which is obviously racialized. Certain people are citizens, real citizens. Other people aren't
*  really. I think that's at real core of it. Like, yeah, you were saying Paul Ryan looked at the tea
*  party and said, oh, you know, it's about cutting Medicare and so on and so forth. He said, no,
*  they don't like Obama. They don't think Obama's really an American. That's it. He got that
*  immediately. He says he's not really American. That's what he was saying. What he's constantly
*  saying is these people aren't really Americans. So there's that. The other thing that ripens,
*  and I think is that deindustrialization took place. There's a lot of insecurity. People don't have
*  the sense of the same kinds of jobs, middle class jobs that they could hope for. They see
*  rural communities, especially really collapsing and falling apart. I mean, look, it sounds like
*  very big melodramatic rhetoric to talk about the death of the West or something like that. But I
*  mean, my God, if you look at a lot of the country, they're ruins. But it was a once great civilization
*  and there are parts of this country that look ruined. I mean, this is a way that we can is
*  too much of an egghead. Yeah. West is an egghead way to think about this. Exactly. And Trump says
*  he says crippled America. And he says it right. Those are very abstract concepts. And he says
*  your life sucks. Look at where you live. It looks horrible. He just says it. He says,
*  and we're going to fix things. I think that that's really underrated is that people on the right say,
*  oh, urban areas are so horrible and people are afraid to go out on the street. Whatever. But if
*  you go into a lot of rural ex-urban areas, there's a, I would argue, like kind of an ongoing depression,
*  which is missed by economic statistics. And I think that is a huge part of the sense of
*  dissatisfaction that he gets into. I do think it's worth noting here that it's not true that
*  everybody voting for Donald Trump is left out of the economy. In 2020, he won voters with family
*  incomes of a hundred thousand or more. And there are a lot of really, really rich people voting for
*  Donald Trump. It is also true that many of the people who vote for him are feeling left out of
*  the economy. They're certainly feeling left out of this intersection of the economy and the culture.
*  One way I think income doesn't capture everything here is look, you don't have a lot of poor
*  graduate students voting for Donald Trump. And you do have a lot of people who say run local
*  car dealerships, but the people running local car dealerships in smaller cities have a very
*  different relationship to mass culture than the poor graduate students. They do feel like they're
*  being left out of something. And so then if you go back, you do have David Duke making this argument
*  that the culture is losing itself as a white Christian nation. That if you are now a sort
*  of traditionalist white Christian, that you are fundamentally on the outs. Buchanan picks up on
*  that and says, we are the majority, the forgotten man, the silent majority, and they are betraying
*  our values. They are accepting of homosexuality and pornography and licentiousness and whatever
*  it might be. Trump actually then just picks up on the fact that this world, evangelical Christians
*  in particular, now don't feel like the silent majority. They feel like the embattled minority.
*  I can't even not bake a cake for a gay wedding kind of thing. And he doesn't present himself
*  exactly as one of them. He presents himself as the son of a bitch they need, defending them.
*  Yes. Oh, absolutely.
*  And that both, I think, reflects a kind of intuition on his part, but also a genuine change,
*  not in the social character of Trumpism, but of the nation. We are a secularizing nation. We are
*  a nation where there are differing power structures. We are a nation where what is okay in 2020 or 2016
*  is very different than what was okay in 1990 or 1980. I always think this is actually very, very,
*  underplayed, is the importance of the sense of Christian religious embattlement in the Trump
*  phenomenon. Yeah, I think the evangelical Christian voters and what some people identify themselves
*  as and are becoming more and more identified as Christian nationalists, they're kind of one
*  constituency that has, I think, a pretty clear instrumental attitude towards Trump in certain
*  ways. They know that he can get through certain conservative policy programs and they've been,
*  rewarded for staying loyal to him. So I think that in some ways, they have a very instrumental
*  idea of Trump, again, goes back to the kind of gangsterism of it being like, we need a gangster.
*  Although I do think this is something that has changed a bit. I mean, this has been very
*  broadly reported on, but in 2016, the relationship was instrumental. He said he would put our judges
*  on the court. Yes. And 2024, it's no longer instrumental. At least not among evangelical
*  Christians as a kind of community. It's become a deep, he is chosen by God, sort of thing.
*  Yeah, no, that is absolutely true. Something changed there very dramatically.
*  Yes, there is obviously a lot of people who have a messianic conception of him. And I think that
*  what his politics are plugging into is something mythical. It is a sense of American decline,
*  American catastrophe that can be reversed through his power. And a lot of people who had versions
*  of that are becoming seduced to his message and that he's the deliverer of that. And that's the
*  strength of his politics. One of the things that has been an interesting shift during the Trump
*  years is it's almost a little bit jarring. Big business was supposed to be a Republican constituency,
*  there was still a big sense of material division in American politics. And Democrats were allied
*  with the environmental groups and the racial equity groups and Republicans had the corporations.
*  And over the past six, eightish years, that's shifted. And even the people coming up behind
*  Trump, your Vivek Ramaswamis, your Ron DeSantis, they're making a lot of their target, the
*  corporations, DeSantis versus Disney. The sense of the basic insight of the populist becoming
*  increasingly the organizing insight of the Republican Party. How do you think about that
*  ideological shift? I think that that's very interesting, important and subtle and hard
*  to tease out sometimes, but I think we could start to do it. So I think that there's an attack on
*  corporate America, so-called woke capital. I do think though, ultimately, Republicans are never
*  really that unfriendly to business, no matter what they say. And there's been some indications
*  from comments of people on Wall Street that said, you know, because of what happened last time,
*  Trump wins, Trump doesn't win. It's not such a big deal. We can really work with this guy.
*  And the Trump administration in actual practice was very good for business interests,
*  not only just tax cuts, but there was some study that done that like, if you had a direct business
*  connection with Trump, like your company saw a market increase in profits after his election.
*  From our perspective, it's corrupt. But for a lot of other people, it's what he's meant to do.
*  He's meant to get the economy going in a certain way, which is not stimulus and so on. So it's
*  connecting the right people. It's making deals happen. And that's the conception of the economy
*  that is a network of family firms and relationships, not big abstract concepts. Well, this gets to
*  a very core part of Donald Trump's more banal appeal to people, which is, look, David Duke,
*  Pappy Cannon, what the hell do they know about the economy? I think the thing liberals do,
*  where they try to pretend Donald Trump had no business acumen and like, well, if you just
*  invested the money he got when he was young in the S&P 500, he also would. Trump turned money into
*  branding and power and cultural centrality. He represented for years in America what success
*  literally meant. He was the big money guy. He was a big money guy. He had the apprentice. He had
*  celebrity apprentice, but he also has these buildings. I mean, you can walk around New York
*  today and like, look at these gigantic buildings with his name on them. He built real things in
*  the real world. And then because until 2020, when the pandemic hit, I would say Trump was largely
*  drafting off of the Obama recovery and then Republicans were happy to spend as much as
*  he wanted. So in addition to the Obama recovery, Republicans stopped cutting spending and just
*  added stimulus into the economy. The economy is pretty good. It's actually better now than it was
*  then, but it was pretty good. And so between both like the memory of a pretty good economy before
*  the sort of inflation and interest rate hit post pandemic and the fact that Trump is still
*  good at performing still maintains that sense in people that he is maybe this great businessman,
*  that he is somebody who is in some ways connected to like the fundamental currents of economic
*  success. There are a lot of people who don't like his more outrageous comments, his more horrifying
*  comments, who don't like January 6th, but they just don't care that much. Their relationship to
*  politics is more arm's length and transactional. And they're like, yeah, Trump, that guy's good
*  at running economies. I think that that's all absolutely correct. I mean, he was the symbol of
*  a rich guy for so long. He was what people knew as a rich guy. I think this is kind of telling is
*  that I have this memory of being a child. And when I was a child, I didn't really understand any of
*  this stuff. Donald Trump was in the news a lot and he was the rich guy, right? And it was Donald
*  Trump, Donald Trump. And then I heard he went bankrupt. And in my child's mind, I was sad that
*  Donald Trump went bankrupt because I was like, but he's the rich guy. It felt like something had
*  been lost in culture or something. I was like, but that symbol is no longer there now. I don't know
*  where to orient my child mind about it. And I think that that resonates with a lot of people
*  on a deep level. They're like, yeah, he's the rich guy and I want him to be successful. And if he's
*  successful, I'll be successful. I'm in proximity to it. It'll touch me. That'll happen. That's
*  maybe thinking a little too little of people, but I think there's some people out there who think
*  this way. I do think here you get this difference between sort of the liberal conception of how you
*  want to run an economy, which is rightly or wrongly, let's put a bunch of technocratic experts in
*  charge of things. And this sort of populist conception, which is you need to break through
*  to the part where the treasure is kept. You need a person. I mean, this was always Trump's appeal.
*  Yeah. He said very explicitly, he has this line I love from 2016 where he says,
*  I've been greedy my whole life and now I'm going to be greedy for you. And there is a sense of him
*  as a guy who knows how to work the back rooms. And if you believe the whole thing is corrupt,
*  then what you need is a guy who understands the corruption working on your behalf.
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  And then he does this very explicitly. So I want to play a clip from Trump that gets it sort of
*  two dimensions of this simultaneously, because it both includes one of the really terrible things
*  he said recently that got a lot of liberal outrage attached to it. And then also gets at,
*  I think him making this argument from a recent rally.
*  If you're listening, President Xi and you and I are friends, but he understands the way I deal
*  those big monster car manufacturing plants that you're building in Mexico right now,
*  and you think you're going to get that you're going to not hire Americans and you're going to
*  sell the cars to us now, we're going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the
*  line. And you're not going to be able to sell those cars. If I get elected. Now, if I don't get
*  elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole that's going to be the least of it. It's
*  going to be a bloodbath for the country. That'll be the least of it. But they're not going to sell
*  those cars that building massive. I think that that clip is really interesting. So on the one
*  hand, people probably heard about Trump saying, if I'm not elected, it's going to be a bloodbath.
*  And I think in context, I feel like he is if you're being fair, fair. He's saying this sort of as
*  an internet like a very weird way to make a point about how badly America is going to be broadly
*  ripped off. Right. And there's this way in which he gets pulled out of context. And then that looks
*  to his supporters like like the media is against him. Right. And on the other hand, that is a crazy
*  way to describe that. Yeah. But there's also this other thing he's saying like we're I'm friends
*  with President Xi. He knows how ideal like I'm going to be like I'm going to be the son of a
*  bitch on your side. Right. Cutting the good deals from for you being the sort of gangster negotiator
*  on your behalf. And like that's a message he's like pinging at his people right there. And there is
*  power to it. Absolutely. I think that that's a key to the conception of business that his supporters
*  have. And it's not a stupid conception of business. It's true. I mean, business has a lot of relationships
*  and Trump has has instrumentalized them. He thinks he's better than he probably is. But you know,
*  there is a correct populist assumption, which they look at elites and they say, well, these people
*  are all friends and I'm not part of that group of friends. Why do people get involved in politics?
*  Right. When you're let's say you're on the make as a businessman, a small businessman. Well,
*  you get involved in politics, you meet a lot of other people can help you out. These things are
*  just true in parts of the American system in the highest rhetoric. They don't often get spoken to.
*  And I think that appeals to people too. He's just talking about what how the sausage is made.
*  Sometimes it's too crude. Sometimes it's a stupid way of looking at things. Things are more
*  complicated. But he he's willing to tell people the truth from their perception about how things
*  are actually done. And then there's the other side of the bloodbath comment, which is whatever he
*  meant it as in that paragraph, this is a guy who presided over encouraged, like a January 6th
*  insurrection that almost like literally did have blood, but almost became a true murderous blood
*  bath in the halls of Congress. And he's opening rallies with the people who participated in the
*  insurgency singing the Star Spangled Banner. Well, yeah. And there is this question always,
*  I think, and this goes back to the slipperiness of how to take them. You have a quote I really like
*  about January 6. And you write, from a certain perspective, the critics who say that talking
*  about fascism takes Trump too seriously or correct, it involves too much hocus pocus and cloaks him in
*  a certain dark grandeur. And it gives everything a Spanglerian gloom that makes him seem bigger than
*  he is. After all, he's just a crook and a con man and idiot. But the phoniness, the bombast and the
*  ridiculousness was a part of the original thing too. There's always been a deeply moronic side to
*  fascism. Fascism is perhaps most fundamentally a moron putting on world historical errors,
*  morons trying to make history. What better way to describe January 6. The second biggest mistake is
*  to take it too seriously. But the first biggest mistake is to not take it seriously enough.
*  But you don't really say then in that piece, where does that leave you? How do you take it?
*  It's difficult. I think you constantly have to adjust your judgment of it. Look, the song
*  with the January 6 people, I mean, this turning the fallen of the previous attempts into martyrs,
*  after the February 6, 1934 riots at the French parliament, which is one of my favorite comparisons
*  to January 6, there was a concerted effort by the French right to turn the fallen into martyrs. And
*  to say this was a moment in which our movement was sort of baptized by fire. There's definitely
*  an attempt to raise the people who were at January 6 into martyrs. I mean, that's very difficult to
*  argue with, I think. But in terms of that question, I would say this. I think that the record of
*  thinking of Trump as a fascist or would be fascist has a better predictive power than saying that
*  he's not. So everyone said, this guy, you know, he's such an idiot. He's so weak, you know, he
*  doesn't really have the political skills. And he definitely doesn't have the organization. He doesn't
*  have an SS or an SA or the black shirts behind him. Really. He's got these kind of idiot militias that
*  are totally disorganized. Okay, true. But the people said, well, what would a fascist dictator do?
*  They would try to use their militias to make some kind of extra legal attack on power and try and
*  stay in office, right? Well, he did that. So I would say that the theory of Trump, of treating
*  Trump as if there was something seriously constant with the history of fascism, just has a better
*  record as a theory of Trump. I mean, it's obviously not perfect. It's obviously not a perfect analogy.
*  I actually want to put the literal question of fascism to the side for a second, because I think
*  people get really caught up on very specific historical questions. There was actually an
*  argument you've made, I think, quite well. But the point that treating Trump as genuinely dangerous
*  has a record. And something you said gets at one of my really core concerns right now.
*  Two things. One is that this point that the fact that he sometimes seems a little buffoonish
*  is actually important to understanding how, not why it can't happen, but why it can. Because the
*  buffoonishness of these guys going all the way back. Mussolini, Hitler, anybody. And I don't
*  always love the comparisons. Partly because he's a Jewish person, I think Hitler is a specific
*  comparison. But a lot of the people who have deeply endangered political systems or taken them over
*  in a violent way, one way they got there was people underestimated them for a long time. And the way
*  they got underestimated was they seemed a little bit ridiculous. But the second thing there is you
*  were just saying, one of the critiques made of why it couldn't go that far with Trump last time was
*  that he didn't have a strong organization. He could barely run his own administration.
*  That's not where he is now. Well, I still don't think that he has quite... I think there are more
*  people who are willing to do his bidding and would be part of a Trump administration, be more
*  effective. He doesn't have vast armies of uniformed men at his disposal to intimidate voters and that
*  sort of thing still. But yeah, he's a little bit more organized and canny in terms of his danger
*  absurdity level. I think another thing, even for his supporters, for everybody, I think this is a
*  way that Trump works on everybody. There was an article a while back about why Hasidic Jews like
*  Trump. And they use the Yiddish term Haimish, which is like homey, cozy, right? There's something
*  familiar about Trump. And this also goes back to his New York accent and stuff like that and his
*  gangsterism that kind of puts you at ease because you're like, it's familiar. I know this kind of
*  guy. They're not that dangerous. They're just kind of a... It's Pat. Yeah, it's Pat. Like,
*  all right, he's a little bit outrageous. But it's not that alien or scary because he's just like a
*  guy I know from TV. I know guys like this. I know guys that talk like this. It's going to be strange
*  to see this. He can kind of drop the menacing scene and seem a little cute sometimes and look
*  kind of... And hug people and seem lovable. And he has the ability, I think, to put on the charm
*  and drop people's defenses. And I think that that's what people are responding to a lot is that,
*  hey, it's just kind of a schmuck. And we know a lot of schmucks. But I think this argument for
*  why Trump was underestimated worked better before January 6th and after. If the question in 2016
*  was for a lot of liberals, like, how can people like this guy? He's saying the most awful things.
*  He seems like this cruel buffoon in many ways. He's even saying terrible things about Republicans.
*  The question in 2024 for a lot of them is, you've all seen what he's capable of. You saw January 6.
*  You saw that mob at the Capitol. You see the criminal cases against him right now. You saw
*  him actually try to intimidate people to overturn the election, not just with a mob, but also
*  calling state election officials. And yet, if you look at polling, Trump is polling better than he
*  ever has in terms of his matchups with the Democrat. There's never a period in any previous
*  election where Trump led. And he's not been behind for very long in this one. And he's leaving now.
*  And so there is this thing that I think people thought, well, if people just see what he's
*  capable of, they just know that we're right about him. And it didn't work at all. But I'm curious
*  how you read that. A lot of people just don't really understand that stuff and don't give a shit.
*  Well, what do you mean don't understand it? Because it's not like you need a lot of,
*  like, you don't need a post-grad degree to understand a mob at the Capitol.
*  I don't know. I think that the amount of people who are aware of what happened is probably smaller
*  than you think it is. The amount of people who conceptualize it in the way that we do, that it
*  was a sincere attempt to overthrow democracy in America, is not as big as we think it is. The amount
*  of people who view it as something positive and what they want to look wanted is probably not huge
*  either. But I think there are a lot of people who just don't have a strong view or clear understanding
*  of what happened at all and don't care. You see this in the history a lot where there's moments
*  in which these would-be dictators get to a point where it looks like their coalition's about to
*  collapse. They do something outrageous. They do something really bad. Mussolini did this when he
*  had an opponent killed and the conservatives who backed him were like,
*  this is starting to look like it's not the kind of thing we want to do. And they even say, and it
*  looks like he's about to collapse. And then somehow they politically navigate this situation. The
*  conservatives say, well, we can still get some things out of him. Now he's vulnerable. He needs
*  us even more. And now we got him. So we'll continue to provide support because this actually leaves an
*  opening for us. Right after junior six, you're like, oh, the Republicans are going to finally
*  have enough. No, he's been able to navigate and get over those waves and breakers several times.
*  He's lucky, but he has a certain amount of skill. And he also has a lot of, he still has a
*  constituency behind him, which they can't ignore at their peril. Sometimes a literal peril.
*  I don't know how he becomes dictator, but he definitely wants to. That's not up for debate.
*  That shouldn't be up for debate. So when you then think about the history of how
*  sort of these populist right figures do end up diminished, right? I mean, some of them just get
*  defeated, right? You kind of just doesn't win. Duke doesn't win, but in other countries they do win.
*  Sometimes in other countries they do take over. When you look at history, what do you think this
*  nets out to? I mean, is it just either they don't win the first time or they get defeated in a war?
*  Like what is your view to the history here? Sometimes, yeah, they get defeated. They get,
*  they take over a country and then they get defeated in the war or, you know, usually
*  sometimes they take power for a little while. They get into some kind of crisis and their regime
*  collapse because it doesn't have enough support. And sometimes it just fizzle out. I think it's
*  important to remember, I think fascist propaganda about the thirties and so it's like, it makes
*  these movements look inevitable, like the force of history, right? Like they're just moving and
*  they're there was impossible for them to stop. And they had so much power for you on them.
*  And that gives us a kind of cartoonish picture of them in point of fact, there were many
*  contingent points along the line where things could have gone otherwise and their political
*  support could have collapsed all of a sudden. And they got lucky just as easily as things taking
*  power is, you know, fortune goes the other way and he doesn't get the right equation. He doesn't get
*  the backing of the people he needs. It doesn't form the coalition he needs. It might go back into the
*  reservoir to use your metaphor, but it just fizzles in a certain way.
*  Aaron Powell And what about the reservoir itself? I mean,
*  one of the things that I find scariest about Trump and is the way he's infected the broader
*  Republican party, particularly now that he's been back on the scene. I mean, different people are
*  trying to learn something from him on the right. And I do think it creates this question of how do
*  you reduce the demand for something like him, which I'm not sure is the same question as how
*  you beat him. Aaron Powell
*  My obvious instinct to this as a kind of social democrat, New Deal democrat kind of guy is that
*  we need to, I know the economy appears to be doing well. I strongly believe that there are
*  structural issues that need to be answered about how Americans leave behind a better life for their
*  children, how jobs feel more secure, how the country feels productive and heading in a certain
*  direction. Our country has a story behind it and leadership that feels like it's taking it that way.
*  I think that's a big part of it. I hope I do believe in the United States, especially
*  everyone who's tried to become a mini Trump hasn't really been able to do it.
*  The stances campaign, Fizzle, Rama Swami didn't really go anywhere. I think honestly, and I hate
*  to say this because it's something he would say it's really he's pretty special guy. And he
*  Aaron Powell More and more people are saying that.
*  Aaron Powell People are saying it. I think like as I was saying, he's a synthesis like he
*  is uniquely positioned to synthesize all of these different aspects and come together as
*  the kind of perfect candidate for these types of politics. It makes sense. Oh, you're like, oh,
*  yeah, TV guy, business guy, big racist. Yeah, it kind of all adds up. And so much of this politics
*  is a cult of personality and about the charisma of the individual who represents all of these things.
*  Like the leader really matters in these types of politics. So I think that the loss of this
*  leadership beat through looking like a loser two times, ending up in jail. I think it would be
*  pretty devastating. I think it would be a big setback for right wing populism to lose Trump for
*  sure. Aaron Powell And then always our final question, what are three books you'd recommend
*  to the audience? Aaron Powell Ah, okay. So my first book I would was is kind of big and long,
*  but it's one of my favorite books about American history is called What Hath God Wrought? The
*  Transformation of America 1815 to 1848. History of America and like the Jacksonian times. It's a
*  wonderful history, but I just think it's so interesting to see how the country, although it
*  was so different back then, there are so many things that feel familiar, so many culture,
*  kind of culture wars, so many political issues, so many different divisions between different
*  geographic parts of the country that really still have some kind of resonance with today. And I just
*  think it's a wonderful book and everybody should read it. Now, if you don't want to read a 900 page
*  book, I can offer something much shorter, which is a book called After Nationalism, Being American
*  in an Age of Division by Samuel Goldman. It's just a wonderful book on what it means to be American
*  today and how we've lost and still have some of the myths and themes of American history.
*  And the third book I would recommend is The Politics of Cultural Despair by Fred Stern,
*  where he talks about the kinds of people in Germany who prior in the 19th century kind of created the
*  ideological underpinnings for what became Nazism. And it's a wonderful book.
*  John Gantz, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
