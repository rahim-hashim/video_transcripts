# How Martin Wolf Understands This Global Economic Moment
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [August 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-DM2Hp23CM)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Hey everyone, as you've probably noticed already, there's a different voice behind
*  the mic today.
*  My name is Roger and I'm the senior editor for the show.
*  Ezra is officially on book leave for the next few months, so we're going to be having
*  a range of different guest hosts subbing in while he's away, starting with yours truly.
*  So let's get to it.
*  A few months ago, the US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, gave a speech that
*  I think is the single clearest distillation of how the Biden administration is thinking
*  about this moment for the global economy.
*  In that speech, he argued that the world is experiencing something of an economic paradigm
*  shift.
*  For a whole host of reasons, from climate change, to the rise of China, to Russia's
*  weaponization of its energy resources, the era of unfettered globalization and free markets
*  is ending.
*  And according to Sullivan, we're entering into a new era that requires very different
*  kinds of policies and institutions.
*  The speech really stood out to me because over the last few years, most economics coverage
*  has been dominated by the inflation story.
*  But this, to me, is the much bigger economic story that's been simmering in the background.
*  The global economy is undergoing a series of big tectonic shifts, many of which are
*  years and years in the making, and policymakers around the world are trying to figure out
*  how exactly to respond to them.
*  So for a while now, I've wanted to spend an episode focused on that bigger story.
*  And in my view, there's just no better person to do that with than Martin Wolf.
*  Wolf is a former senior economist at the World Bank and currently the chief economics commentator
*  at the Financial Times, as well as the author of numerous books, including most recently
*  the excellent book, The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism.
*  A few months ago, I happened to be at an event with Wolf, and when I asked him about how
*  he's thinking about all of this, he outlined this framework that I found to be the most
*  helpful analytical model for understanding this moment in the global economy.
*  And so I asked him to come on the show and walk me through it.
*  As is always the case, the show's email is Ezra Klein Show at NYTimes.com.
*  Here is Martin Wolf.
*  Martin Wolf, welcome to the Ezra Klein Show.
*  It's a great pleasure to be with you.
*  Great pleasure to have you.
*  So I want to start with the big picture.
*  Tell me about your shifts, shocks, fragilities framework and why you think that's a helpful
*  way to think about the global economy.
*  Well, I think we have to step back first.
*  It's obvious, really starting with the global financial crisis, that a lot of things have
*  been happening in a very disorderly and confusing way over the last 15 years.
*  Obviously, these processes started earlier, which have surprised and shocked people.
*  And so the normal way of thinking about the world, let's just try and forecast the next
*  year or two or three, doesn't really work very well.
*  One needs a more analytical framework.
*  And I've been thinking about this for quite a while and a number of different approaches,
*  But the one I found most useful is to think about where we are in terms of these three
*  aspects of the global environment and focusing very much on the economy.
*  So the first is shifts, by which I mean long term structural processes that are occurring
*  and are likely to continue to occur over a generation or more.
*  Things that most of the time we don't think about, but they're constantly changing the
*  environment we're in.
*  And then the second, rather different set of things are shocks and events that were
*  always conceivable.
*  You couldn't really forecast them because the probabilities and the processes weren't
*  known well enough, but they could happen and it so happens.
*  A lot of them have.
*  Very recently we've been through a period of exceptional shocks in terms of their rapidity
*  and their impact.
*  And the final aspect of the world's economic system, if you like, is the underlying fragilities,
*  the things that make the shocks so powerful.
*  And those are both economic and political and the political also includes institutional
*  processes.
*  And I argue that the fragilities are extremely important in understanding why we find it
*  so difficult to cope with both the underlying shifts and the shocks well.
*  Well I want to dig into each of these and I want to start with the shifts because as
*  you said, they're the ones we often ignore even if they are often changing the global
*  economic environment more than anything.
*  So let's start with the first one.
*  Tell me about the rise of China and how it has shaped the global economy.
*  Well this is, I think, probably the most visible and unexpected thing if you look at the world
*  from the point of view of 40 years ago.
*  So I can remember very well, because I was working in the World Bank at the time, in
*  I think it was 1980, when for the very first time the World Bank was visited by a few Chinese
*  officials, senior ones.
*  And they were wearing mouse suits and they really seemed to us, almost like a visit from
*  Mars, we didn't know anything about China, its potential impact, the economy, was it
*  very, very poor, very undeveloped and we didn't really think it was particularly important
*  and we didn't think about what it meant.
*  Now four decades later, four decades, this is the fastest economic transformation I think
*  in world history, even faster than the rise of the United States in the late 19th century
*  and early 20th century, China is a superpower.
*  And it is part of, the biggest part, of a broader rise of East and South Asia, which
*  you have to remember contains half of the world's population, and which was, one might
*  say the centre of civilisation for a very long time.
*  For that, China in particular and the broader rise of Asia has completely transformed the
*  balance of economic influence and power, and so global power.
*  And it has changed patterns of trade, it has changed the nature of competition, both economic
*  and political, it has changed the Western sense of itself.
*  Remember this was a world that the West essentially ran for several centuries and suddenly we
*  got this non-Western, non-liberal power erupting into the middle of it.
*  So I think that is pretty obviously the biggest shift and the most rapid shift in the world.
*  Today China and Russia, if you add them together, it depends on your weight, are about half
*  the economic size of all the Western economies together, and that's a huge shift in power.
*  And you started getting at it in that answer, but what are some of the specific ways that
*  the global economy is different today, in large part because of the rise of China, because
*  of the rise of South and East Asia?
*  How is it different than it was when you were at the World Bank in 1980 because of these
*  trends?
*  Well, it's important to stress, and I'll come to the ways in which it isn't really different,
*  and that's quite important.
*  The most important one of all is the shift in world trade and world markets.
*  So for many countries around the world, particularly the commodity exporters, but also countries
*  quite close to China, this is their far and away their biggest market.
*  This is the market whose rise and fall, both in the medium term and in the shorter term,
*  really shapes what's going on, the prices of commodities, their opportunities, and so
*  forth.
*  So that's on the export side.
*  It has also created a completely new set of suppliers, a new set of competitors.
*  Very large number of developing and emerging countries, but also developed countries have
*  found that industries that they thought were well established and stable have been outcompeted
*  by China and have disappeared.
*  And that's become a very big political factor, not just in the US, where it clearly is if
*  you look at the background to what President Biden is doing, but also in Europe.
*  The Germans are very worried about Chinese competition and many developing countries
*  in South America, also India, feel that they're exposed to the threat of deindustrialization.
*  A lot of the progress they made is being reversed because China is such a phenomenal competitor.
*  And then finally, and crucially, because of this new emerging power on these multiple
*  dimensions and the growing difficulty of cooperating with them successfully, we're beginning to
*  see real fragmentation in the world system.
*  It's not quite decoupling very far from it, but there is much less of the sense that there
*  is a single global order overseen by the dominant Western powers above all the US.
*  These are really profound transformations.
*  At the same time, it is important to stress where the West remains absolutely dominant.
*  The world's dominant currencies are those of the United States and its allies.
*  The dollar remains the single most important currency by far.
*  The Western capital markets, financial markets, particularly those based in New York, to a
*  lesser extent London, remain the dominant financial markets.
*  And overall, I would say that, and this is shown with the recent developments in artificial
*  intelligence, that the Western countries remain technologically in the lead.
*  But even there, there's certainly much more real competition than there used to be.
*  So on multiple dimensions, we live in a very, very different world from the one that we
*  took for granted four decades ago.
*  There's so much in there I want to follow up on and that we will, but I want to stay
*  with China for a second, because I think China's ascendancy, its continued ascendancy at least,
*  was considered inevitable a few years ago.
*  But in the last year or two, the narrative has really flipped in a lot of ways, right?
*  So first you had the zero COVID lockdowns that really hurt the Chinese economy.
*  Entire cities were locked down, unemployment spiked.
*  There was this major protest movement.
*  But then last December, the country lifted its lockdowns and the belief was that growth
*  would surge.
*  It would continue on its previous path.
*  And that just hasn't really happened.
*  Growth for China has been much lower than expected.
*  The unemployment rate among China's urban youth recently reached the highest number
*  on record, over 20%.
*  The country's real estate sector, which has long been the engine of its growth, looked
*  like it was recovering and then started tumbling again.
*  So given how important China's rise has been for the global economy, how it's shifted so
*  many things, what do you make of the trajectory now?
*  What's actually going on with the Chinese economy?
*  And why hasn't it gotten back on track as quickly as people expected?
*  So actually, I've written a number of pieces on this possibility.
*  These were quite a long time ago, six or seven years ago, both in the Financial Times and
*  elsewhere.
*  And I think we have to start by saying it's not yet clear whether this is a fundamental
*  break in China's rise or merely an interruption.
*  And that depends partly on what the Chinese do and partly what happens in the world.
*  If it is a break, then there's of course a crucial question of how profound the break
*  is.
*  So let's just consider these aspects.
*  And it really involves understanding what's going on.
*  So the growth rate that China had up to about 2012, so a few years after the financial crisis,
*  which was close to 10% a year, there wasn't any doubt that that wasn't going to be sustained.
*  It was going to slow.
*  And the slowdown occurred partly because export growth couldn't be sustained at that rate
*  because China just become too big and it had saturated so many markets.
*  But also, they had done so much of the investment that was needed.
*  Their infrastructure had already become superlative, really almost overdeveloped for the size of
*  the economy as it was.
*  They needed to find some other way of maintaining growth.
*  And what they went for was the biggest real estate boom or bubble, I think, in world history,
*  which meant that they then started generating huge increases in debt to finance this huge
*  real estate boom on which demand was heavily dependent.
*  And so China, in the last decade or so, started showing many of the characteristics of the
*  Western countries before the global financial crisis.
*  I think of it, sometimes I refer to this as the law of the conservation of financial bubbles.
*  We stopped and they immediately had to run into one.
*  They blow up one, which is indeed what they did.
*  Now it was obvious by 2016, I was starting to write about that, that was not a sustainable
*  driver of growth in China.
*  And at some point, they were going to stop it.
*  And in the last year or two, three, they really have stopped this.
*  But that, of course, knocked out or weakened a massive part of demand in the economies.
*  And that's one big structural reason why demand has been weak and growth has been weak and
*  employment has been weak.
*  That's, as it were, the macroeconomic structural challenge they have.
*  And Japan has faced the same problems since the end of the bubble in the 80s.
*  And the bubble in the 80s, and I've been writing this for about 30 years in Japan, was motivated
*  by the desire to do exactly the same thing in Japan after their high growth period ended.
*  So it's the transition from ultra high growth to merely fast growth that really breaks this
*  debt accumulation, high investment model.
*  Then even more, I think, important, certainly as important, is the second huge problem,
*  which goes something like this.
*  The Chinese system tried to achieve something quite extraordinary.
*  And I think only Dong Xiaoping would have had the nerve to do it, which was to combine
*  a communist political system with a capitalist economy.
*  Most of us would have said, can you do that?
*  And asked in 1980, we said, it's impossible.
*  And I think Dong was prepared to do this because he knew they needed the growth.
*  But one consequence of that sort of growth within a communist system with no rule of
*  law is that corruption clearly exploded.
*  It was inevitable that it would because all the resources above all the land that capitalists
*  needed to do their business, all this depended on permissions from government.
*  And the officials who provided it, well, quite naturally, they wanted a share of the winnings.
*  And the capitalists were perfectly prepared to give them a share of the winnings.
*  And in the process, the capitalist system and the party system merged.
*  And it started making people feel this was a completely corrupt system.
*  And there was lots of protests about this.
*  And Xi Jinping was clearly, who was obviously a bit of a control freak, also thought this
*  was threatening to the viability of the Communist Party.
*  So what he did then was to crack down on corruption.
*  But if you crack down on corruption, you are cracking down on the market economy in China,
*  because the, I've written this many times, corruption is part of the system.
*  And so the more he cracks down on corruption, the more difficult it is to sustain the dynamism
*  of China's capitalist system.
*  Many of the capitalists get frightened.
*  Some of them leave the country.
*  Some of them stop doing the risk taking they did before.
*  The bureaucrats become more cautious.
*  And the underlying growth dynamic of the system also slows.
*  It seems to me this macroeconomic problem that I've described has coincided with this
*  deep problem of how can you run a capitalist economy indefinitely in a politically accessible
*  way within a system in which all power is concentrated in the Communist Party?
*  How do you do that?
*  They don't know how to do that.
*  Then of course, along came the great shock, we're going to get into the most important
*  shocks of the last few years, indeed the most important, the pandemic.
*  And that really started destabilizing the system, frightened the wits out of the people,
*  constrained economic activity and slowed down the whole engine.
*  And a lot of the growth in a system like this depends on the expectation that growth will
*  continue.
*  As soon as businessmen conclude that actually the economy isn't going to grow very much,
*  then they conclude, well, we shouldn't invest so much.
*  And if they decide that they're not going to invest so much, then the growth will slow
*  and then you are in a trap.
*  And I think their danger is that now they are in moving into such a growth trap.
*  And that means that where China is going to go over the next 20, 30 years is, I think,
*  one of those great uncertainties that we have to contemplate.
*  And other countries have written a lot about this recently, like India, may well be doing
*  better.
*  Well, let's talk about that.
*  Because if the story of the global economy over the last 20, 30 years has been the rise
*  of China, now, for all the reasons we've been talking about, we're beginning to see a pretty
*  significant shift in certain kinds of investments away from China and towards countries like
*  India, but also Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia.
*  So for instance, right now, the vast majority of iPhones, and this has been the case for
*  a long time, the vast majority of iPhones are made in China, as opposed to about one
*  in 20 in India.
*  But by 2025, the share of iPhones made in India is expected to rise to closer to one
*  in four.
*  And then you have other companies from Sony, Google, Microsoft, shifting production from
*  China to places like Vietnam and Thailand.
*  And so one prediction, as you sort of alluded to there, is that as China continues to become
*  less and less attractive, both for the structural reasons you talked about, in addition to the
*  sort of West's encirclement of it and the geopolitical risk of investing there, that you're going
*  to see a shift in the regions and really the world's economic center of gravity away from
*  China specifically and to this broader set of Asian countries centered around India
*  and others.
*  And so I'm wondering what you make of that possibility and then what you think it would
*  mean for the world economy if it did happen.
*  Now people are really beginning to look at India with interest.
*  And of course, India is like China, inconceivably vast.
*  Its population is now the same size as China's.
*  And it is expected that in the course of this century, it will become maybe four, five hundred
*  million or more bigger.
*  So the human resource potential is essentially limitless.
*  Now hitherto, India did liberalize in the 1990s in its trade opened.
*  It has never made itself a really successful base for manufacturing production, though
*  it has been quite successful in some aspects of services.
*  There is no doubt that this government in India is very determined to find ways to get
*  India into the production of goods for export, part of the global supply chain within this
*  China plus one context.
*  And of course, they would certainly like there to be more services coming from India consulting,
*  IT services and so forth.
*  There is no doubt there's potential there.
*  There's also no doubt that providing the quality of infrastructure, the quality of the bureaucracy,
*  the integration of production systems that China has created will be immeasurably difficult.
*  So my assumption at the moment is that China will remain a central part of supply chains
*  for many products for the foreseeable future.
*  But there will be additional countries playing a part.
*  It will become, as it were, more Asian and less Chinese.
*  From our point of view in the West, this probably means that in the things that China has been
*  so successful at, like you mentioned, the assembly of iPhones and the production of
*  so many other products, it won't mean things will be so different.
*  And it is also worth stressing that in some areas, and I think one of the most interesting
*  is in auto-beam manufacture, where China's market is far and away the biggest in the
*  world and where they are real leaders in electric vehicles.
*  And more broadly, they are leaders in solar cells in many aspects of the Green Revolution
*  more broadly.
*  China's lead might actually grow.
*  So it's going to be a very complicated pattern.
*  But I do think it is plausible if people play their hand right that the desire of our companies
*  to diversify their source of production and to resist being swallowed by China will lead
*  to greater diversification of the location of production across Asia and a little bit,
*  but I suspect less, bringing back production in certain areas home, back to our homes.
*  But it's going to be a complicated process and I think it's incredibly important to
*  stress that it leads for the foreseeable future.
*  Removing China altogether, given the immense efficiency of its productive systems, the
*  concentration and agglomeration of skills in particular areas, removing China altogether
*  just seems to me wildly infeasible.
*  Well that in a lot of ways brings us to the second big shift that you talk about, which
*  is deglobalization.
*  So you've been starting to get at it here already, but first, how has globalization
*  shaped the world economy over the past, say, 40 years?
*  And then also, how is that beginning to change now?
*  Well, this is a very big and complicated story.
*  So let's look at it in the big picture.
*  I think it's first very important to understand that globalization is not just trade and certainly
*  not just trade in goods.
*  It includes trade in services.
*  It includes flows of capital, foreign direct investment, portfolio capital, the integration
*  of capital markets.
*  Flows of ideas, its flows of people.
*  It is the creation of sets of institutions, which are to some extent global ones.
*  The World Trade Organization is a feature of this.
*  So it's a very complicated process, and that makes it rather difficult to discuss simply.
*  So it's very important to understand some of these things could change radically and
*  others could endure.
*  My core belief is that given modern technology, the way we can spread information around the
*  world however hard we try to control it, that the complete end of our, as it were, global
*  self-awareness, the awareness that we are sharing economic systems and indeed the planet
*  will continue in many ways to grow.
*  And the environmental crisis is one aspect of that.
*  I think it's very important.
*  If I focus more narrowly on trade and the related investments, I think the things we
*  can say are something like this.
*  First of all, if you use standard measures, ratios of trade to world GDP, the proportion
*  of a value added in a product which comes from many different countries because the
*  components and the assembly are all in different places.
*  In all those sorts of dimensions, and perhaps even more important, certainly less important,
*  the extent to which companies became transnational, genuinely organized their production systems
*  across borders.
*  In all those respects, what happened between, let's say, 1980 and 2010 or so, 2008 to 10,
*  is completely unprecedented in world history.
*  We became more integrated on all those dimensions by a really very large factor than had ever
*  happened before.
*  China was a big part of that, but it wasn't the only part of that.
*  Essentially the system that the West had created for itself, particularly say in Europe, in
*  the post-war period went global.
*  What we can say now is if we look at it in terms of policy and in terms of actual flows
*  of trade and capital, that ceased to be dynamic.
*  It ceased to grow faster than the world economy about 15 years ago.
*  Since then, we haven't had a huge reversal on the evidence, but it hasn't continued
*  to grow.
*  As it were, we've passed peak globalization in all those dimensions.
*  There are other aspects, I'll give you the most obvious one, data flows.
*  Data flows are absolutely exploding across borders just as they are within our countries.
*  So it's a very complicated picture, but in the big picture globalization hasn't continued.
*  It hasn't reversed, at least not in a dramatic way, but politics are now against it.
*  I'm not at all sure that will reduce trade, but it will shift it around.
*  It becomes more politicized.
*  The liberalization process that was dominant for some decades has clearly halted and most
*  of the evidence suggests is now somewhat reversing.
*  We're becoming more regional and we're becoming more suspicious of trade with countries we
*  deem potential adversaries.
*  That's a very important development.
*  How far that will go towards reversing the globalization process, we don't know, but
*  we're seeing that.
*  I really appreciate that answer because I think there's been a narrative over the past
*  few years that what we're witnessing is sort of the cracking up of globalization.
*  And that's not really what you see in the data, right?
*  Like trade and capital flows.
*  While as you said, as a percentage of world GDP tended to peak around 2008, they've generally
*  in absolute terms been increasing over the past few decades.
*  And then COVID was a setback and everyone sort of thought this was a big setback moment
*  for globalization.
*  But by 2021, global trade had recovered to past pre-pandemic levels.
*  And then global flows dipped again in the wake of Russia's invasion, but overall trade
*  actually increased in 2022.
*  And that's even true in areas where there's been the most talk of deglobalization, right?
*  The dollar value of trade between the US and China set a new record last year.
*  Oil and gas markets have basically completely adjusted to Russia's invasion.
*  And so I think one view of this is that when you look at the data, it looks like the story
*  of the last few years isn't one of globalization's downfall, but globalization's resilience.
*  But on the other hand, I think what you're getting at in the end of that answer when
*  you talk about geopolitics is what I've recently come to think about sort of as the paradox
*  of this moment in deglobalization or globalization.
*  And this is a point made in a recent paper by Penelope Goldberg at Yale and Tristan Reid
*  at the World Bank that I found really helpful, which what they argue is yes, when you look
*  at the data, globalization looks fine.
*  But the argument they make is that the data on trade flows in particular is actually a
*  lagging indicator, right?
*  Trade is downstream from trade policy.
*  Policy is downstream from political sentiment.
*  And when you look at the policies being made right now, when you look at the way that political
*  rhetoric around being tough on China and onshore industry, it seems like we're clearly moving
*  in the direction of deglobalization.
*  And their argument is eventually it could really show up in the data in a significant
*  way, but that data is just a lagging indicator.
*  And so I'm wondering sort of what you think about that theory.
*  I think that's perfectly plausible.
*  As with all turning points in world history, including world economic history, it's very
*  difficult during those moments to identify what's going to happen, at least unless you
*  have the start of World War One, in which case things are pretty dramatic very, very,
*  very quickly.
*  So if that, for example, actual hostilities between the US and China over Taiwan, God
*  forbid, then things could change very rapidly because I think we'd move quite rapidly into
*  something like a global blockade.
*  And the impact of that is sort of unthinkable.
*  It's certainly gigantic.
*  It would be a transformational moment, as the Great Depression was in the 30s and of
*  course, World War Two.
*  So I think this is very perceptive.
*  But I would like to introduce another nuance, which is, I think, very, very important.
*  The US debate on trade is sui generis because the US is sui generis.
*  And I think it's important, particularly if we're talking to Americans, for them to understand
*  – it's a point I made often – is that things like this don't look the same elsewhere.
*  And there are two or three aspects of this which are crucial.
*  First, the US sort of thinks – and it's the only economy that can think like this
*  at all – that it is possible and possibly even desirable to be close to self-sufficient.
*  The United States became the biggest economy in the world largely as a self-sufficient
*  country with a very small amount of trade and highly protectionist trade policies in
*  the 19th and early 20th centuries.
*  When it liberalized trade, it did it in large measure, not entirely, because it wanted to
*  the development of its allies, particularly in Europe.
*  And it was perfectly prepared to open its markets to help them as long as it didn't
*  disrupt its own economy too much.
*  And that worked out quite well.
*  So it created a global order which it sort of assumed wouldn't be too dramatic in its
*  effects upon itself.
*  And the similar attitude continued as this worked quite well through the 80s and 90s
*  while China was blowing up, blowing up in the sense of becoming such a gigantic player.
*  But more recently, it's pretty obvious that the Americans suddenly said to themselves
*  something that everybody else knew, took for granted.
*  My God, this trade stuff is changing our economy dramatically.
*  We're losing lots of jobs.
*  We're being forced to specialize in areas we're good at.
*  And we're losing labor-intensive manufacturers.
*  We don't like this.
*  Why don't we go back to being self-sufficient?
*  And in addition, we expect to be a completely secure superpower.
*  We don't depend on crucial imports from other countries.
*  We can basically make everything ourselves.
*  And because of its resources and scale, that's not a completely ludicrous proposition for
*  Americans.
*  But if you look at any other country in the world, or even Europe as a whole, we can't
*  be self-sufficient.
*  We're always going to be huge net importers of commodities, as China is.
*  Our markets aren't large enough and our technologies are not in aggregate advanced enough to be
*  self-sufficient in all the products we need.
*  And that's even truer of the smaller countries within them, let alone all the countries around
*  the world.
*  In other words, all the prosperous countries in the world today, other than perhaps United
*  States, know that their standard of living depends on sustained, enormous trade with
*  one another.
*  Some of it's regional within Europe and some of it's global.
*  I won't go into the individual countries.
*  So they look on this as a de-risking process in the genuine sense.
*  Yes, there are some risks and they want to manage it.
*  They want to maintain crucial technological strengths.
*  Germany is very concerned about that.
*  Japan is concerned about it.
*  But there is no debate that I can see, not really anywhere, about actually ending globalization,
*  reversing the great process of integration of the last 50 or 60 years, because they know
*  it's completely and utterly infeasible.
*  And so the nature of the debate, the rhetoric about this, is in a very profound way different
*  from the US and all the Asian countries I mentioned.
*  India has a little bit of this dream of self-sufficiency, though.
*  I think it's absurd.
*  And this means, I'm not trying to say that the US isn't crucial, of course it is, but
*  might actually happen.
*  It's very different from what Americans might envisage or imagine or conceive of from their
*  own debate.
*  It's just not the same debate elsewhere.
*  I think that's a really important point about the uniqueness of America here.
*  But also I think it's important to point out that there are also, I think, some really
*  key debates within America and within the American conversation.
*  And something that I've noticed when we're talking about how the US views the future
*  of globalization is that there are really two major critiques of globalization here
*  that I think are often conflated, but lead to very different policy prescriptions.
*  So one is what you can think of as the China shock argument, which as the now famous paper
*  David Otter and colleagues showed, was that globalization and the sort of outsourcing
*  of jobs to China led to a pretty significant loss of manufacturing jobs in a lot of Midwestern
*  factory towns in the US that many believe helped fuel the rise of Donald Trump.
*  And then sort of the second argument is what you can think of as the China entanglement
*  argument, which is that the US economy is now deeply entangled with and dependent on
*  the economy of a country that is increasingly authoritarian and hostile, which makes us
*  really vulnerable if China decides to weaponize certain choke points in the global economy
*  like Russia recently did with energy.
*  And often in the US, I think these two different critiques are made together, but often in
*  practice they can lead to very different policy directions.
*  So to take one example, one of the big questions in the US right now is what to do about critical
*  minerals.
*  Because if you want to manufacture, say, electric vehicle batteries, which the US wants to do
*  a whole lot of, you need a bunch of lithium and cobalt and nickel.
*  And the same is true with different minerals for a whole lot of clean energy technologies,
*  including solar and wind.
*  And right now, a huge percentage of critical minerals are processed by China.
*  And so there's this question of how we want to go about getting those minerals here.
*  And the Inflation and Reduction Act was pretty clear about this.
*  It said that for an EV to be eligible for one of the major tax credits in the bill,
*  it needed to be made with a certain percentage of critical minerals processed in the US or
*  one of the handful of countries that the US has a free trade agreement with.
*  And the intention there was to onshore a lot of the critical minerals processing back
*  here to America.
*  But something the Biden administration has been doing as a way to sort of work around
*  the law is to create these new so-called critical minerals agreements with certain allies like
*  Japan and Europe so that EVs with minerals sourced from those countries can qualify for
*  the tax credit.
*  Now that is very nerdy and in the weeds, I know, but this is where the divide in the
*  US comes in.
*  Because if your main worry is about the US being too entangled with China, then you are
*  clearly going to favor those kinds of agreements because they help you to untangle from China
*  quickly.
*  But if your main worry is about creating more domestic blue collar jobs, then those agreements
*  look terrible because we should be mining and processing those materials right here
*  in the US with US labor.
*  And you sort of see this divide within the Democratic Party right now.
*  The Biden administration signed one of these agreements with Japan earlier this year, and
*  it got attacked by a bunch of high ranking Senate Democrats and not just the usual suspects
*  like Joe Manchin, but folks like Richard Neal, like Ron Wyden, who are usually pretty staunch
*  administration allies and who hold really key positions.
*  And so it really does seem like even within the US, there's multiple different critiques
*  of globalization.
*  One sort of that leads you towards more of this on shoring, we need to do it all alone
*  approach and one that's much more in favor of a friend shoring, let's together try to
*  disentangle from China approach.
*  And it seems those really lead in different directions.
*  And so I guess I'm wondering if that's something you've seen as well.
*  And more broadly, how you understand some of these different cleavages or divides within
*  the deep globalization conversation.
*  I think that that's a perceptive and important distinction.
*  Obviously if you look at the recent discussions in the United States and the way these issues
*  were handled in this very significant speeches by Janet Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury,
*  Sullivan, National Security Advisor, they are trying to converge on a view which is
*  more as it were in the latter camp that as you defined it.
*  Yes, they talk about a foreign policy or Sullivan talks about a foreign policy for the middle
*  class which brings these dilemmas right into the open, obviously, but it looks as though
*  the insistence that we're not decoupling, we're de-risking is more security oriented
*  than it is jobs oriented.
*  And therefore I can understand from the point of view of those Democrats who are really
*  concerned about the latter, it doesn't look as though where the core of the administration
*  is landing is where they want them to land.
*  But I think there's also an analytical aspect of this.
*  Obviously these are very different issues as you've implied, which means that trade
*  policy gets very complicated when you have all those different concerns.
*  I mean my own view is that there is obviously real issues about generating employment and
*  good employment in America, but the China shock is ancient history.
*  If you look at the data, basically happened in roughly the first decade of this century.
*  And since then actually the share of manufacturing employment in total employment in the U.S.
*  has been remarkably stable and there's been no repeat of this extraordinary shift.
*  Trying to bring back all the industries that went then is I think going to be very costly
*  and mostly very unproductive.
*  And in other countries I don't think many of us really think that we can bring back
*  the sorts of industries that were lost to China at that stage.
*  The reason this is such a huge issue in America is that America failed so completely to generate
*  place-based adjustment policies that allowed crucial parts of your economy and particularly
*  places in your country to adjust to these shocks.
*  And that's a much broader policy error than just a trade policy error.
*  We do get absolutely clearly into two fundamental longer run issues which you can see.
*  The one is obviously of huge concern to Americans which is can we avoid losing our technological
*  leadership to China?
*  My view is the main issues there will be the nature of domestic policy, the ability to
*  sustain innovation and make sure that innovation and innovation hubs continue to be dynamic
*  because I think the US clearly has the best systems in the world.
*  It should be more confident about that.
*  And the second aspect is of course straight national security things which is can we produce
*  the things that are actually essential for our capacity to fight wars if we have to fight
*  them, God forbid.
*  And there's the economic security.
*  We don't want countries to be able to turn off the taps and that's why we want to diversify.
*  We want to diversify productions to friendly places but that doesn't lead you necessarily
*  to producing at home.
*  It isn't the case that if everybody produced their own protective equipment at the beginning
*  of COVID we would all be more secure.
*  The probability is we would have ended up in that situation with chronically inadequate
*  domestic supply.
*  It would have been just as bad.
*  So we have to be very subtle in the way we think about economic and national security
*  and the policies we frame.
*  There's one final element which is how does this all look to China?
*  The US thinks it's very vulnerable.
*  The Chinese know they're vulnerable.
*  They feel very vulnerable to embargoes of all kinds.
*  I think that reciprocal vulnerability, the Chinese awareness that they need trade, that
*  they need investment, that they need technology is actually a stabilizing force in the world.
*  It means that there will be very strong voices in China arguing against a hostile policy
*  because the interests in favor of avoiding that are so great.
*  If we really cut China off, quite apart from the huge economic threats, costs to us, they
*  will be sizable.
*  It's inevitable the Chinese will then feel they have nothing to lose by hostility because
*  we cut off all the gains.
*  So we have to be very, very careful about this policy of trying to reduce China's capacities
*  against us and reduce our dependence on China because it means it also reduces China's dependence
*  on us, which I think has significant strategic value.
*  I do think again that the recent visits by Secretary Blinken and Secretary Yellen to
*  China indicates that these nuances are understood in the administration.
*  I understand fully why Congress people might take a different view because they still remember
*  and they represent places which have been hit by Chinese competition.
*  I think focusing on that and trying to pursue a policy designed to reverse that is very
*  likely to prove a costly failure.
*  So I'm glad you mentioned the Jake Sullivan and Janet Yellen speeches because we've been
*  talking a lot about these big structural shifts in the global economy, the rise of China,
*  de-globalization.
*  We haven't got to talk explicitly about your third big shift, climate change, but for those
*  who want to understand more about the policy response to that, we just did a great episode
*  on the Inflation Reduction Act with Rob Meyer that we can link in the show notes.
*  And it's very clear that these shifts have really been top of mind for the Biden administration.
*  So to the speech you alluded to, in April, Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan,
*  gave a speech outlining what he called a foreign policy for the middle class that I felt was
*  the clearest articulation of the Biden administration's thinking to date.
*  And I really think of it in two separate parts.
*  I'll do my best to summarize it here.
*  One is the diagnosis, which is that the era of unfettered globalization and free markets was
*  a failure on multiple fronts.
*  Geopolitically, it enabled the rise of an authoritarian China and empowered a rogue Russia.
*  Economically, it created a disastrous climate, fragile supply chains, skyrocketing inequality.
*  Politically, it made the US vulnerable to the rise of populists like Donald Trump.
*  And then the second part of the speech is really the prescription, which is more or less that
*  industrial policy, the kinds of policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS Act,
*  that these kinds of policies can sort of help address all of these different pillars at once.
*  With these bills, we can simultaneously decarbonize the US economy, become less dependent on China and
*  Russia, and deliver a more equal economy all at the same time.
*  And the reason I make that distinction is because you just wrote this really great book,
*  The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism, where I think you share a lot of the Biden administration's core
*  diagnosis, especially this part about economic forces making the US political system vulnerable
*  to a politician like Donald Trump. But in your recent columns, you've been a little bit more
*  critical of the Biden administration's proposed solutions to that problem. So I'd just love to
*  hear from you. I know you got at it a little bit already, but what does this vision, this policy
*  vision of the Biden administration get right? And what parts of it are you more worried or
*  skeptical of? So this is obviously a central question. My view is that their analysis
*  broadly defined of what's gone wrong in America and the political consequences
*  of the erosion of the sense of security of what you would call the middle class,
*  and their sense of vulnerability and insecurity, which is reinforced in complex ways by cultural
*  changes, has been a very important economic and political process, which has led, among other
*  things, to their attraction for a classic authoritarian demagogue in Donald Trump.
*  And that's very, very frightening. It has world significance. Obviously, it has significance for
*  the US. And they're entirely right in recognizing that and wanting to do something about it.
*  So the question is, beyond the rhetoric, are they broadly on the right lines with what they are
*  proposing? And I think there are probably two ways of thinking about that, which indicate why I'm a
*  bit skeptical. The general approach of economists, and I plead guilty to this, is that if you've got
*  all these different objectives, you want to make your economy more secure. You want to get more
*  jobs for the middle class, the working class, as I would define it. You want to improve national
*  security. You want to promote decarbonization of your economy. You want to make, do something that
*  really reduces carbon emissions. You would say, well, you will need multiple instruments of policy,
*  very distinct instruments of policy, to achieve those objectives. Because that's sort of the basic
*  rule of thinking about policy. You need at least one instrument for every objective,
*  and sometimes you need more than one. So I think that they are expecting too much
*  from what is essentially an industrial policy. It is a multifaceted industrial policy,
*  but nonetheless, I think they're expecting too much. In particular, I think they won't end up
*  by generating anything like the scale of permanent employment they hope for. They will not, I think,
*  generate genuinely globally competitive industries to the extent that they want from this. A lot of
*  them will need subsidies indefinitely. And most importantly, the amount of resources, money that
*  is going into this is just not big enough fundamentally to reshape the economy. Where it
*  might work is improving nationalist security in a few areas, which seem to me quite important.
*  I do understand, for example, why the US does feel very vulnerable in its dependence on import
*  semiconductors, which are truly essential products and are produced in very few places in the world.
*  Similarly, I can see the concern about, though I'm less worried about this, the dependence on
*  Chinese solar panels. But even there, I think the discussion of how you define what your
*  economic and security vulnerabilities are and how you respond to it optimally is
*  rather inadequate, somewhat naive. So I'm concerned that the policy has great rhetoric. It has a few
*  quite visible totemic activities, but it's not going to change US emissions very much.
*  It's not going to change US manufacturing trajectory very much. In the end, it's not
*  going to change the political environment that much. And a lot of that might be because really
*  and truly Congress and therefore the American people aren't prepared to make the really radical
*  changes that might actually do much about this. So I would consider myself sympathetic with the
*  objectives, understanding the politics of the objectives. But I'm less than confident that we
*  will, five, 10 years from now, look back on this set of policies and say, this was truly
*  transformative. And as I pointed out in some of my columns, the US has a fairly long history of
*  industrial policy. Some of it has been a magnificent success, but a lot of it has been a pretty bad
*  failure. And once you start on this in the sort of political system the US has, rent seeking by
*  people trying to get hold of subsidies can easily lead to massive distortions. In fact,
*  distortions in the economy, which are not so terribly distinct from the rent seeking we're
*  already seeing in many of the US economy's most important sectors. I may be wrong. I hope I'm
*  wrong. But my view is there's too much expected from what are really overall quite totemic changes.
*  I think that's really well put. But to put on my Biden administration hat for a minute,
*  because I have talked to a lot of folks in the administration or who recently served in the
*  administration and I want to respond how I think they would. And I think the first way they'd
*  respond, which is something you alluded to, is that of course these bills weren't perfect,
*  but they were the best that could be done within the constraints of the American political system.
*  The Biden administration had a 50-50 Senate that hinged on one senator in particular, Joe Manchin,
*  in a highly polarized society with a budget reconciliation process that forced everything
*  into one bill. And it had tried to include things like an expanded child tax credit,
*  care agenda, and that just didn't work. The only way you could get enough political support was
*  to go with this more industrial policy approach. But I think the second thing they'd say is,
*  look, we don't know if these industrial policy bets are going to pay off.
*  But when you look at what's been happening already, it seems like they're already working.
*  And not only working, but surpassing basically everyone's expectations.
*  So according to the administration's estimates, more than $500 billion in private sector
*  manufacturing investments have been announced since they took office. Biden himself recently
*  pointed out that while spending on manufacturing construction only increased 2% in the four years
*  of the Trump presidency, it's increased 100% in just the first two years of his presidency.
*  And it seems like every week there's a new battery making plant or chip fab or solar
*  project being announced. So I think part of the case they would make is, look, it's working.
*  And then you look at the projections outward. And I think some of the best, most extensive
*  modeling of this has been done by the Princeton-led Repeat Project, which they're looking at the
*  modeling of the jobs that Biden's legislation could create. And they're specifically looking
*  at the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure bill. And under their middle of the
*  road scenario, they estimate that the combination of just those two bills alone will create around
*  1.5 million additional jobs by 2030 and 2.5 million by 2035. And you mentioned, you're not
*  sure how many of these jobs will be permanent, but of those 2.5 million jobs created by 2035,
*  just over 600,000 are in construction. The rest are in other areas like manufacturing that will
*  continue past the construction phase. And then lastly, I think a point they've made to me
*  is that it is truly important to build up a domestic manufacturing base, not just because
*  of the jobs it could create or the dependency on China in particular, but also because it's
*  important to have the kind of flexibility to adapt to the challenges of tomorrow.
*  And I think China here is ironically the go-to example, right? When COVID hits, China is quickly
*  able to manufacture a ton of PPE that it is then exporting while the rest of the world struggles
*  with shortages. And the reason is because it has these deep reservoirs of experience and know-how
*  and infrastructure needed to manufacture at scale. And when you talk to folks in the Biden
*  administration, they talk about wanting to build that same capacity here, not just because it will
*  help with the industries of today, but because we live in an uncertain world and in an uncertain
*  world, we don't know what challenges we're going to face next. And it's important to have that
*  sort of core industrial capability right here at home. And so I know that was a lot, right? It's
*  political constraints. It's the fact that the IRA and these bills are already working. It's the
*  need for a domestic manufacturing base. But I'm just wondering how you think about those arguments
*  from me as the quasi representative of the Biden administration here.
*  Well, let's respond in turn. On the first one, I am really sympathetic to the argument. And that's
*  one of the reasons why, unlike many of my friends, and I've been criticized by some of my friends on
*  this, and you probably would guess who some of them are, I have been more open to the view that
*  this is worth trying. And it's worth trying because I think something had to be done politically.
*  I'll come to the economics in a moment. And as you rightly say, given the nature of American
*  politics in general, and specifically today, this was probably the best that could be done.
*  And I accept that. So it's conceivable that, you know, if I'd been asked by anybody in the
*  Biden administration what they should do, and they told me this is all they could get through,
*  I would have said, okay, of course, go for it. So that seems to me perfectly reasonable.
*  The second is, and Paul Krugman, who I admire and respect, has made this point particularly
*  forcefully, it does seem that these programs have led to more investment than most people expected.
*  And that is important. And it might last. And I'm just putting the qualifications,
*  because we really don't know how this is going to end up and whether viable industries will be
*  produced. But, and you put forward, in fact, this is where the buck comes in,
*  some figures on gross jobs that might be generated. Now, we know that a lot of these
*  jobs will go to people who are already employed. And many of those people will be people who are
*  already employed in manufacturing. So how much of it will be a net capacity increase in manufacturing
*  is, I think, and it's not clear to me, the third element, which I think is probably true,
*  and it comes back to our earlier discussion about the desire for a pretty large amount of
*  self sufficiency is that to be a strong economy, one needs a strong, flexible, and resilient
*  manufacturing sector. And that's certainly how everybody thought about this, you know, from the
*  middle of the 19th century on until relatively recently. How far this is true in current
*  circumstances, how far it is true that you can move people who have skills and capacities in one area
*  to the ability to produce effectively in another area that is particularly sensitive for you,
*  is not clear to me. You pointed out that the Chinese could produce more protective equipment
*  quickly than anyone else could. But of course, they did actually export a lot of this, it was
*  available. How much the US should have invested in the capacity to produce something that they
*  thought most of the time they were not going to need, I think is at least an open question.
*  The overall economic benefits of focusing on the revitalization of manufacturing in a very
*  highly advanced high wage economy like the United States is something that one just has to be a
*  little skeptical about. And I think that there could still be substantial disappointment in this.
*  But I do recognize, this is the final point, the US is the only economy in the West that can
*  plausibly have a go at this. And it might be because of the scale of the economy and therefore
*  the economies of scale that can be generated within it, it might turn out that quite a few
*  of these industries are reasonably viable, and they give therefore correspondingly reasonable
*  degrees of increased security. I can understand those sorts of arguments. But the real test will
*  be how costly this is going to be, how much of it will generate truly competitive industries in the
*  long run? Is the electric vehicle industry going to end up as an American industry, fully competitive
*  with the Chinese industry or not? These are pretty fundamental questions. And the only test there
*  is the test of time.
*  So we've been talking a lot about these bigger shifts in the global economy and how the Biden
*  administration is responding to them. But there are plenty of more immediate crises that the
*  administration is responding to as well. So I want to pull in the second half of your framework here.
*  Tell me about the shocks and fragilities facing the global economy.
*  Well, the shocks that we've been going through, I'm going to put aside the global financial crisis,
*  though actually I think we've very much been living in its shadow. It's not gone. But the
*  shocks that matter obviously were the pandemic, then the impact of the recovery from the pandemic
*  with the pandemic itself on global supply chains, and the disruptions caused there. And then, in my
*  view, largely as a result of these two things together, the sudden and completely unexpected
*  rise in inflation. Suddenly we were having inflation in the way we hadn't seen for 40 years.
*  And it was linked, of course, to an energy shock, partly before the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
*  but reinforced by it. So it had inevitably, for someone like myself, echoes of the 70s,
*  and early 80s. And that has led, of course, to something really important, which was a big rise
*  in interest rates. I noticed that many economists think that the Fed has now finished its tightening
*  monetary policy, but it's quite a tightening. And it's been quite sudden. And of course,
*  this then links to the fragilities, because the most important fragility in the economic space,
*  as it were, which is global and national in the US case, we have extraordinarily highly indebted
*  economies. It's particularly true in the US for government debt, which is at very high levels by
*  historical standards. That's overt government debt, very high levels. And of course, debt in
*  the non-financial corporate sector, the financial sector's leverage and the household sector's
*  leverage, it's less of a problem. If we look at the world as a whole, and we talked about China,
*  but that's true almost everywhere, we have the most highly leveraged economy, as far as we can see
*  from the data which are limited that we've ever had. And the general rule for economists is if
*  you've got lots and lots of debt around, and it gets much more expensive, and it is, that you're
*  likely to see financial shocks, financial crises. And we've seen some of those, and we could well
*  see more of them. This then all interacts, of course, with other fragilities, which the most
*  important are political. But those are the shocks, which are now interacting with one of our most
*  important fragilities, creating a real question about what the next five, 10 years will be like.
*  A crucial element here is how quickly does the legacy of the shocks dissipate? And here,
*  I think recent evidence might make one a bit more confident about the path of inflation.
*  And that suggests one might be more confident about the future of interest rates, in which case,
*  we may be okay. But right now, we don't know. Let's talk about the inflation picture then,
*  interest rates, because this is one area where the nature of the shock has really changed in
*  recent months. So we're recording this in late July. And according to the June CPI report,
*  headline inflation has come down from around 9% at its peak last year to around 3%. Basically,
*  every other indicator, even though stripping out things like energy and food and rent are down as
*  well. And meanwhile, unemployment in the US has remained below 4%, which is something that most
*  economists really didn't think could happen six months or a year ago. The story was that a
*  recession was inevitable if you wanted to bring inflation down. And that just hasn't been the
*  case so far. So give me a read of the current inflation story. What's happening and where do
*  you think it goes next? That's really important. And I think an honest statement from me so often,
*  including this discussion is I don't know. But my perspective has been that I got something
*  importantly right, and I got something importantly wrong. And the question is where this plays out.
*  I was one of the people who was concerned about the inflationary consequences of the pandemic
*  quite early. I thought that the huge expansion of fiscal deficits combined with the huge monetary
*  expansion of the 2020 and the continuation of that in 2021 created very severe inflation risks.
*  And so I was relatively hawkish on this in 2020 and 21. And that proved to be correct. And I argued
*  this wasn't going to be temporary in the sense that the Fed could just ignore it. So I supported
*  the tightening policy. And I think it was broadly correct. Now, I was one of the people who thought
*  that once inflation began to be entrenched, particularly in labor markets, and you were
*  seeing it in wages and earnings across much of the Western world, that it will be very difficult
*  to disinflate smoothly without a rise in unemployment. And there were a number of others
*  who took very similar views. And right now, it's beginning to look as though that was too pessimistic.
*  I think there is one quite interesting reason why that might be wrong. And that is that actually
*  unemployment is not a good measure of labor slack. And that in particular, there is, as I understand
*  a reduction in hours worked in some economies, I'm not sure how much in the US, but certainly elsewhere.
*  And that's, of course, also an indication of labor slack. And of course, there's a reduction
*  in vacancies. And that is also an indication of labor slack. And it may be that now, with our
*  very much more competitive labor markets than 50 years ago, and much more flexible labor markets,
*  a reduction in vacancies, and perhaps to some extent hours, is itself enough of a loosening
*  of the labor market, a reduction in excess demand, that all of their own will eliminate or vastly
*  reduce the pressure on wages. And so might the reduction in headline inflation, even though it's
*  not a reduction in 2% levels, the target levels of core inflation. So at this sense, I think-
*  Can I just jump in there? Just to clarify, just to make sure, because I think this is a really
*  important point. So what you're saying is that one reason why we might not have seen sort of
*  unemployment have to rise for inflation to come down is because when you look at sort of typical
*  models of the core drivers of inflation, a huge one is wages. And so the belief is that as long
*  as labor markets remain tight, and usually sort of employment is a measure of the tightness of
*  labor markets, wages will keep pushing up and so inflation will keep pushing up. And like the
*  typical way to solve that is that the Fed raises interest rates, which causes unemployment to rise
*  and things cool off. But what you're saying is that actually what we're seeing is that the labor
*  market seems to be cooling off without unemployment rising, because there are these other sort of
*  metrics, right? Like hiring is back to pre-pandemic levels, vacancies are down, workers aren't
*  quitting as frequently. And so what we're seeing and what economists might have not expected is that
*  wage growth itself is starting to slow down, the labor market is starting to cool, but it didn't
*  require a big spike in unemployment to do that. I just wanted to make sure that I'm clear on that.
*  And that is an argument that one of the Fed governors, if I think it's Governor Waller made,
*  and I was rather skeptical about it, but it looks more plausible now, or at least less implausible.
*  And let me be very clear, I would be very, very happy if that turned out to be the case, that we
*  can eliminate the danger of a sort of wage price spiral without actually raising employment
*  significantly. It will mean, of course, that for many workers, their real wages will have declined,
*  which is not a good thing. Because after all, there has been now an extended period of high
*  inflation, and we're not expecting negative inflation. So price level will be higher and
*  wages won't have fully caught up. And of course, as the Bank for International Settlements recently
*  pointed out, the last mile might be the most difficult, because we haven't got back to core
*  inflation of 2% yet. And that's presumably the target. And it might turn out that actually,
*  we're not going to be there so easily. So I'm somewhat agnostic about the future.
*  I think it's still quite possible that getting core inflation back to 2%, which I think is the
*  right objective. We can discuss that separately in the circumstances. There's a lot to be said on that,
*  that getting there will still require a slowdown, which shows itself up in open unemployment.
*  But it now looks to me at least more plausible than I thought a year or so ago,
*  that the disinflation process can be carried out without any significant rise in unemployment.
*  And that would seem to me wonderful. And it shows that the labor market and the economy,
*  which is not surprising in a way, doesn't operate now in the way it did half a century ago,
*  and in a way that is rather cheerful. And if that's the case, it's quite plausible. The feds
*  has reached peak interest rates now. And in the next year, interest rates will start coming down
*  and things will look better. So I take your point that getting from three or 4% down to 2% inflation
*  could be much harder and more painful than getting to this point. And that core inflation,
*  should be the right measure of that. But I think there are a few responses you'll hear from some of
*  the more dovish economists to the argument. And I want to hear what you think of them.
*  So the first one is that core inflation actually isn't the right indicator,
*  because a huge component of core inflation, and just for people, core inflation is inflation,
*  excluding certain volatile prices like energy and food. But a huge component of core inflation,
*  about 40% actually, is shelter, it's rents. And the price of rents has a well known lag
*  in the data of about a year, because most people have one year leases. And so the current rent
*  prices baked into the core inflation measure are still reflecting the housing market of a year
*  before. And in this case, the housing market of mid 2022. And we just know from a lot of different
*  sources that rents have been falling for some time now, even if that hasn't been reflected in
*  the numbers. And so I think the first response you'll get from economists is, look, when you
*  look at core inflation, it's sort of artificially high. But if you look at something like super core,
*  which also strips out rent, it's much lower. So that's sort of the first argument is like,
*  maybe core inflation isn't the right measure. But then the second and I think more important
*  response is, why are we even shooting for 2% in the first place, especially if that might require
*  really bringing the hammer down on the labor market. So when I look at the current economy,
*  right, GDP growth is the highest in the G7 in the US right now. Labor force participation for
*  prime age workers is the highest it's been in decades. Real wages are on the rise for the first
*  time since March 2021, which means that even with inflation at its current levels, workers across
*  the board are coming out ahead. We mentioned earlier the low unemployment rate. And so in
*  many ways, this feels like exactly the kind of pro worker, fast growing economy that we've been
*  hoping for really ever since 2008. And so it feels strange to say that we're going to bring the hammer
*  down, we're going to throw people out of work, we're going to possibly, you know, risk another
*  banking crisis, just to get inflation down from four or 3% down to 2%, which, you know,
*  the 2% target itself is a pretty arbitrary one anyways. And so I'm wondering how you think about
*  both of those points, both the sort of core inflation point, and then also the like, is it
*  even worth trying to get down to 2% if it's going to require some pain? So excellent points and
*  excellent questions. And I think I would divide my responses into the time horizon and the target.
*  They're very different. So the crucial point, as I think our earlier discussion shows, there's
*  huge uncertainty about what's going to happen. And you've indicated some of the aspects of that.
*  I think that the Fed has already done a very substantial tightening. And I would not,
*  I think I probably wouldn't have supported the last rise. It would be perfectly sensible
*  for the Fed to say, given the lags in monetary policy, that we've already done a sizable
*  tightening in response to this unexpected surge in inflation, that may well be one of the reasons
*  why inflation is slowing, that people are aware that we're not going to accommodate anything.
*  But there's no reason whatsoever to tighten further, given the lags, we'll see what happens.
*  And if these arguments about shelter are correct, we'll begin to see over the next six months to a
*  year, very appreciable slowdown in core inflation. And we don't need to act, given the tightening
*  we've got in the bank already, preemptively against, you know, bring down the hammer, as you put it,
*  any more than we've done, maybe we've done too much, we're going to watch and see. And I think
*  that would have been and would be a perfectly sensible policy. And if it becomes obvious that
*  core inflation is indeed, for the reasons you just, beginning to fall rapidly towards our target,
*  and we finally hit it a year or a year and a half, or even two years from now, that's not a big
*  problem. And as soon as it's obvious that's happening, we're going to start loosening,
*  and probably quite aggressively. I think that will be a perfectly reasonable approach for the Fed to
*  take. The time horizon combined with the uncertainty would suggest to me, and given the arguments you
*  made, that the right thing to do now, possibly to have done, is nothing, and just see what happens.
*  Then there's the question of what the objective is. Now, I think that targets are, to some extent,
*  arbitrary. And whether it's 2 or 2.5% really doesn't excite me very much, and I wouldn't worry if it
*  ended up in 2.5. And there is an argument to be made that maybe inflation should be a bit higher.
*  I won't go into that argument now because it's complicated, but one could make it.
*  I think there are two considerations nonetheless that the Fed does, and I think should bear in mind,
*  in deciding this. First, if the Fed decides to change its targets significantly,
*  just because it's difficult after an unexpected period of inflation to get back down to it,
*  it is going to undermine, ineluctably, the credibility of any target. And I think one of
*  the great benefits of where we've been, and one of the reasons we got through this crisis, without
*  a huge spike in underlying core inflation, including wages, is actually very clear from the
*  figures that the credibility of inflation expectations in the medium to long run has
*  not been undermined. And so the Fed risks undermining its long-term effectiveness by
*  showing itself willing to change the target. Not the timing of getting back to the target,
*  but the target itself, just because it gets a bit difficult. So that's the one reason.
*  The second is, if it creeps up, you start getting to a situation in which inflation is high enough
*  that people start thinking about it all the time. One of the reasons for 2% is, and Alan Greenspan
*  said this a long time ago, and I happen to agree with this point, which is the most important thing
*  we want to do is have a rate of inflation in which basically nobody really thinks about inflation.
*  It's just something that, it's not part of decision making, not part of wage setting,
*  it just goes away. So for those two reasons, provided you don't overdo it now, that's very
*  important. There's no reason they have to get back to 2%, you know, six months from now,
*  but a year or two, I would say that it will be damaging and risky to give up precisely when it
*  looks as though they might be actually able to get back to target without huge costs. And that's
*  just the sort of circumstances in which the right thing to do is, as I said, do nothing and watch.
*  So I want to end by zooming back out to the big picture. When you look at all of these shifts,
*  these shocks, these fragilities taken together, where does it leave you? What are the different
*  potential trajectories you see for the global economy moving forward?
*  Well, I think there's a dominant possibility. I want to be optimistic. So we've had three massive
*  shocks, and that's really extraordinary. We've had them in a very short period. Well, why not assume
*  that that's just unlucky in the draw, and we're not going to have further such shocks. And we're going
*  to get back to something like normal. The people will realize that fighting a war with China is
*  insane. People will start focusing on de-risking a bit, but not actually decoupling. I think that's
*  already beginning to happen. Business as usual will continue. We'll have quite strong economies
*  with high employment across the world. We will manage the energy problem. We will generate more
*  growth with the energy transition. And we will maybe, I think it's actually the more likely chance
*  that over the next 10 years or so, we'll have a good period. And we will preserve a lot of what's
*  really, really good about globalization and maybe lose some of it. There will be many big problems.
*  I think the climate transition is the biggest. But I think there's a dominant possibility
*  that we've survived a period of extraordinary volatility, and not that badly, and it will get
*  back to normal. That's the nicest possibility. The second possibility, of course, is that for
*  political or geopolitical reasons, we have some more really important turbulence. And the thing
*  that has worried me most here is actual war. That it's not just Russia, Ukraine, which is frightening
*  enough, given that Russia has 5,000 nuclear warheads, but possibly US, China over Taiwan.
*  That geopolitical relations are not managed in a stable way. I think it's a low probability,
*  but it's non-zero. And of course, that would be very, very serious. I think that it is possible
*  that the climate situation we're seeing runs away. We have a runaway climate shift, which
*  with incalculable consequences much more quickly than we now expect. That would again be an economic
*  as well as a social and human disaster that would clearly make things worse. And of course,
*  we can have political developments within any of our countries, but again, the US is most likely,
*  which will destabilize much more of the world, possibly even the whole Western Alliance system,
*  which is an important part of global stability. I don't regard these as high probabilities.
*  On the more optimistic side, again, we have technological changes underway, notably in
*  artificial intelligence, which we're not discussing, that might mean conceivably a huge further
*  acceleration in global growth. These, I think, would be possibly hugely beneficial.
*  So I want to stress that though there are lots of worries and concerns, there were pretty large
*  worries and concerns in 1950, and that turned out to be the beginning of 20 years of extraordinary
*  success for much of the world. And I would also like to stress that this period of globalization,
*  everybody's so critical of, generated the fastest reductions in poverty worldwide ever,
*  not just in China, but across the world. So I remain ultimately, provided we manage our politics
*  in a sensible way, both nationally and globally, I'm actually an optimist. And I want people to
*  feel they should be and can be optimists. We have the capacity to improve our world,
*  and we should take advantage of that capacity and that opportunity.
*  Well, it seems like no matter what trajectory we end up heading for, we're going to need lots of
*  wisdom to help us navigate it and hopefully get to those optimistic situations. So let me ask you
*  the question that we always end the podcast with, which is, what are three books that have influenced
*  you that you'd recommend to the audience? Well, I'm going to do something which I think
*  is possibly a bit naughty, but I hope it's all right. I have, as you know, been focusing
*  very much of my efforts intellectually on what's happening to our democracies and the policy
*  and the environment within which our democracies are operating. And apart from obviously my own
*  book, there are three works which are being particularly important in my thinking about
*  three relatively recent books. Two of them, unfortunately, are co-authored by one person,
*  Darren Atremolio of MIT, who has, I think, been an enormously significant thinker in the area of
*  political economy. He's, I think, the leading economist, academic economist who's written
*  on political economy. And one of them was really important for me. It's a book he wrote with
*  Robinson, this is Atremolio and Robinson, called The Narrow Corridor. And it's about the fragility
*  of democracy and the finding that sweet spot between Leviathan, the excessively authoritarian
*  state, and anarchy on the other. And that's organized freedom. And I think it's an absolutely
*  brilliant discussion of that. And the second book he co-authored is the most recent with Simon
*  Johnson, is called Power and Progress. And it focuses on something absolutely fundamental,
*  which is, can we shape technology to our own ends? I'm more skeptical than they are,
*  but it's unbelievably important that we manage to find a way of controlling the technology that
*  we are generating, the energy technology, which we failed to do, and now the computing technology
*  that we are employing, so that we are the masters of our technological development, not the slaves.
*  And I think this is such an unbelievably important topic, and it's one I didn't focus on. So I think
*  those two books are really important. The last is, to me, a seminal book, which is sort of in a way
*  an anti-Atremolio and Robinson, was by Robert Gordon. It's called The Rise and Fall of American
*  Growth. And it really explores why there was this huge wave of innovation between 1880 and 1940,
*  roughly 1950, 1960, actually, into the 60s, and then the decline. And it's much more pessimistic,
*  and that is very disturbing for the future, because if productivity growth slows, I think it
*  becomes much more difficult to sustain our sort of society. Our democracy, I think, was the product
*  of growth, and it depends on it. That's a controversial view. Anyway, these three books are, I think,
*  pretty important books, and they're ones I would like people to read.
*  And your book, of course, is The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism. It's excellent. People
*  should really pick it up. Martin Wolf, thank you so much for joining me today. This was really
*  informative, and I had a lot of fun. It was very hard work intellectually, which shows that you've
*  been asking the right questions, and the right questions are the questions to which we don't
*  actually know the answers. Thank you all so much for listening.
