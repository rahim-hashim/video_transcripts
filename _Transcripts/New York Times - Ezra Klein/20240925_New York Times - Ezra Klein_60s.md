# What the Leader of Hamas Wanted to Gain From the Oct. 7 Attacks
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg)
*  I think it's fair to say that when he unleashed his soldiers on October 7th, that he might [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg&t=0.0s)]
*  have hoped for any number of things, even deeper penetration into Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg&t=6.68s)]
*  But it was basically a suicide mission to spark something even larger if possible. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg&t=11.06s)]
*  What he was operating from was a sense that nothing is happening. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg&t=16.34s)]
*  We are still here in Gaza, living the life of the oppressed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg&t=19.78s)]
*  Palestine is not free. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg&t=25.18s)]
*  The West Bank is in the circumstances it's in. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg&t=26.18s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Israelis are negotiating through the good offices of the United States with [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg&t=29.06s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, the Abraham Accords, and it's ignoring us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg&t=33.36s)]
*  We need to blow this up. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg&t=38.3s)]
*  And in their terms, hope for the best that Hezbollah, militias from the Houthis, Syria, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg&t=40.9s)]
*  Iraq, and maybe even Iran will join the battle and the final answer will come. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg&t=46.739999999999995s)]
*  But short of that, we will have exploded Israel's sense of the status quo. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcO3posGuAg&t=52.74s)]
