Video Description: There’s a quieter transition happening beneath the pageantry of this week’s inaugural events — a transition not of power per se but of the rules around how power in Washington works. And the new rules look very different from the old ones.

# The Message of Trump's Inauguration Was Clear | The Ezra Klein Show
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0)
*  I feel like I've been watching two different presidential transitions take place. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=0.0s)]
*  There's been the official one, with all of its pomp and its pageantry, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=5.0s)]
*  the one we call the peaceful transition of power. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=9.0s)]
*  The state of the vote for the president of the United States. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=11.0s)]
*  I watched Vice President Kamala Harris preside over the certification of the election she lost. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=14.0s)]
*  I watched President Joe Biden welcome his successor, President Donald Trump, back to the White House. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=20.0s)]
*  The Honorable William J. Clinton. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=26.0s)]
*  I watched every living former president assemble under the Capitol rotunda to honor Trump's second inauguration. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=28.0s)]
*  What a difference this inauguration was to four years ago. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=35.0s)]
*  When a mob had just stormed the Capitol, when Trump sought to upend the election results, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=39.0s)]
*  and upon failing, did not attend Joe Biden's inauguration. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=44.0s)]
*  Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=48.0s)]
*  The cause of democracy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=54.0s)]
*  And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=56.0s)]
*  This transition, the official transition of presidential power, has been orderly. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=63.0s)]
*  But there's been this other transition happening too. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=72.0s)]
*  A transition not of power, but of political system. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=75.0s)]
*  A transition in the rules and expectations of power. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=79.0s)]
*  There's breaking news from the White House tonight. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=82.0s)]
*  President Biden has pardoned his son, Hunter Biden. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=85.0s)]
*  Something for months the president insisted he would not do. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=88.0s)]
*  The blowback is certainly coming from all directions for President Biden, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=92.0s)]
*  and it isn't just Republicans that are crying hypocrisy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=95.0s)]
*  I understood Joe Biden's pardon of Hunter Biden. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=99.0s)]
*  Hunter had become a particular fixation of the Trumpist right. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=102.0s)]
*  Hunter Biden is guilty of human sex trafficking, and we have the receipts. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=105.0s)]
*  And the idea that they would unleash their revenge on him individually seemed all too real. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=111.0s)]
*  Joe Biden has already lost two children. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=117.0s)]
*  Others may disagree. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=120.0s)]
*  I had trouble begrudging him his refusal to lose a third. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=121.0s)]
*  President Biden leaves the White House with a flurry of 11th hour pardons. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=125.0s)]
*  But then came so many more pardons, culminating in pardons of Anthony Fauci and much of Biden's family. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=129.0s)]
*  It's going to set a terrible precedent. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=136.0s)]
*  And it wasn't just pardons. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=138.0s)]
*  There was the refusal to enforce a ban on TikTok that Biden himself had signed into law. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=139.0s)]
*  And alongside that came the bizarre decision to announce that the Equal Rights Amendment was now ratified, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=145.0s)]
*  as Virginia had accepted it in 2020, becoming the 38th state to do so. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=151.0s)]
*  Today, I affirm the Equal Rights Amendment to have cleared all the necessary hurdles to be added to the U.S. Constitution now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=156.0s)]
*  The Equal Rights Amendment is the law of the land now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=165.0s)]
*  But that wasn't true. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=169.0s)]
*  It wasn't ratified. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=171.0s)]
*  Congress had set a deadline of 1982 for ratification. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=172.0s)]
*  The opinion of Biden's own Justice Department is that Virginia's late act is meaningless. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=176.0s)]
*  The ERA is not ratified. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=181.0s)]
*  And the Biden administration knows it's not ratified. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=183.0s)]
*  All this was just an effort to make the president seem more powerful, more consequential than he really was. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=186.0s)]
*  And why did it wait until the final days of his presidency? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=193.0s)]
*  Changing the Constitution under a controversial theory is not what you do on your way out the door. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=197.0s)]
*  The Biden of 2020 would have done none of this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=204.0s)]
*  In key cases like the family pardons, he said he would not do this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=207.0s)]
*  And then he did it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=211.0s)]
*  This feels in its own way like Biden's submission to the new regime. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=212.0s)]
*  The powers of the presidency are whatever the president can get away with. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=216.0s)]
*  I'm not naive. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=221.0s)]
*  I recognize the presidents have been testing the limits of their authority since the dawn of the republic. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=222.0s)]
*  But for a president like Biden, whose core message was about the preservation of America's constitutional democracy, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=227.0s)]
*  and not just that, but the informal system of norms and values and behaviors that scaffolds that system, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=233.0s)]
*  for that president to leave in this way was a profound statement of its own. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=241.0s)]
*  Maybe the message was cynicism. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=246.0s)]
*  Maybe it was acceptance. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=248.0s)]
*  Because it is clear that things are to be done differently now. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=250.0s)]
*  The beginning of Donald Trump's second term certainly revealed a president who intends to govern based on what he can get away with. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=254.0s)]
*  Trump announced immediately that he was declaring birthright citizenship invalid, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=261.0s)]
*  unilaterally changing the clear language of the Constitution and daring the courts to stop him. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=266.0s)]
*  He's giving TikTok or a pre from the clean language of the law so he can figure out a way to save it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=272.0s)]
*  He's pardoning the January 6 rioters. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=277.0s)]
*  He's renaming the Gulf of Mexico to be the Gulf of America and Denali to be Mount McKinley. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=280.0s)]
*  I was struck in Trump's inaugural address how almost everything mentioned was an executive action that Trump would take and the courts would decide to accept or reject. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=285.0s)]
*  He talked little of laws he wanted to persuade Congress to pass. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=296.0s)]
*  What interests Trump is what he can do alone. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=300.0s)]
*  And watching Trump take the oath of office from the good seats were the CEOs of the major platforms that control America's attention. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=303.0s)]
*  There was Elon Musk, the owner of X and Tesla. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=311.0s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Metta. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=314.0s)]
*  Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=316.0s)]
*  Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=319.0s)]
*  And a bit further back was Xu Chu, the CEO of TikTok. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=321.0s)]
*  For all Trump's talk of manufacturing jobs and auto plants and infrastructure, the CEOs of GM and GE and Ford and Caterpillar were not in that room. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=325.0s)]
*  This wasn't just an assemblage of America's rich. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=335.0s)]
*  It was our attentional oligarchy assembled before Trump. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=338.0s)]
*  All this came just days after the Trump family launched a crypto coin in their own name, a meme coin. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=344.0s)]
*  You can't spend it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=351.0s)]
*  It's just a way to invest in Trump's fortunes, to invest in Trump, to make him richer. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=352.0s)]
*  The meme coin shot to more than $70, and the Trump family and its partners seem to own about 80 percent of the coins, making their holdings worth notionally tens of billions of dollars. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=359.0s)]
*  And then Melania Trump, she launched her own meme coin, which also shot up, although it seemed to harm the value of the Trump meme coin. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=370.0s)]
*  This is all insane to even try to describe. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=378.0s)]
*  But Melania's meme coin comes after she sold her biopic and another project. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=381.0s)]
*  She's an executive producer on both to Amazon for $40 million. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=385.0s)]
*  The scale of the graft and the grift right now is astonishing, and it's all out in the open. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=390.0s)]
*  It's not like politics was free of corruption in 2018 or 2022, but this is a new era of brazenness, of cashing in on power. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=395.0s)]
*  And who's going to stop Trump and his family? Who's going to tell them no? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=403.0s)]
*  We talk about America's system of government as if it is a solid thing, bound by the Constitution and institutions, the way a belt cinches around a waist. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=407.0s)]
*  But it's really just a pile of norms in a trench coat. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=416.0s)]
*  Knock the norms down and everything changes. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=419.0s)]
*  I can imagine what we're seeing leading to backlash. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=421.0s)]
*  I don't think it's safe, I don't think it's good politics to rub America's face in this much oligarchy and corruption. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=424.0s)]
*  I could also see it leading to a consolidation of power as Trump and his allies unite to protect their power, unite to help each other, as has happened in so many other countries. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=430.0s)]
*  But we are either way entering a new era. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=440.0s)]
*  Power did not just pass from one president to another. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=442.0s)]
*  It passed from one regime to another, one set of rules to another. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=445.0s)]
*  And you can see it so clearly because the old regime ended even before the new one began. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6yu6H7scN0&t=449.0s)]
