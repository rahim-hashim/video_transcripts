# When Great Power Conflict and Climate Action Collide
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [August 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KdXQJkCrhA)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  Hey everyone, it's Roger here.
*  I'm the senior editor for the Ezra Klein show, filling in for Ezra while he's on book
*  leave.
*  Before I get into today's episode, I have some bittersweet news, which is that this
*  will actually be the last episode I will be guest hosting.
*  At the end of August, I will be officially leaving the show to pursue my own writing
*  and journalism career, which is really exciting, but also really tough.
*  I've been with the show for four years now, and it's been my dream job in so many ways.
*  It's hard to put words to just how much I'm going to miss it.
*  Anyways, I'll say a bit more on all of that in the outro after the interview for people
*  who want to stick around for it.
*  But for now, I do want to get into today's episode.
*  So we've done a few shows now on the decarbonization effort here in the US.
*  Decarbonization is necessarily a global phenomenon.
*  Nearly 90% of annual greenhouse gas emissions come from outside the United States.
*  So when we talk about decarbonization, what we're really talking about is totally transforming
*  the entire world's energy system.
*  And energy is the foundation of the global economy, of military power, of the relationships
*  between countries, of basically everything.
*  And so when you change the world's energy system, you're completely upending all of
*  that too.
*  So I wanted to have a conversation that takes a global view of decarbonization and the kinds
*  of transformations and collisions and tensions that come with it.
*  And the two individuals who I think have done some of the best work on this are Megan O'Sullivan
*  and Jason Boroff.
*  O'Sullivan is the newly appointed director of the Belfer Center for Science and International
*  Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School and previously served in multiple government roles,
*  including as a deputy national security adviser in the George W. Bush administration.
*  And Boroff is the founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia
*  University and also spent time in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, including
*  as the senior director for energy and climate change for Obama's National Security Council.
*  And in recent years, both Boroff and O'Sullivan have together done some of the deepest analysis
*  of the crucial nexus between the world's changing energy system and the realities of geopolitics.
*  So I wanted to bring them on to talk about that intersection and what it means for the
*  future of the world as we know it.
*  As always, if you have feedback or guest suggestions, the show email is eserclineshow.nytimes.com.
*  Let's get to it.
*  Jason Boroff, Megan O'Sullivan, welcome to the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Thanks for having us on.
*  Good to be with you.
*  Great to be with you, Roche.
*  So your big picture argument is that decarbonization isn't some simple shift in what kind of cars
*  we drive or how we power our homes, that it represents a much more fundamental transformation
*  of the global economy and geopolitics.
*  So talk me through that idea.
*  What is the energy transition, as it's sometimes called, and what does it mean for the world?
*  Maybe I could start by just saying it is so easy to underestimate the scope, the scale,
*  the complexity of this energy transition.
*  Maybe most people think of it simply as switching an energy source from one to another.
*  They think about going from a gas-driven car to an electric vehicle.
*  But it is so much more complicated than that.
*  It is essentially changing not just what energy source we use, but changing how we produce,
*  store, transport, and use energy.
*  And energy, of course, is at the foundation of virtually everything that humans do.
*  So we're talking about remaking the entire energy system of the world, and that is the
*  backbone of a hundred trillion dollar global economy.
*  So this is a massive undertaking, and what makes it even more complicated is that unlike
*  other energy transitions in the past, we're talking about doing it in a very compressed
*  timeframe due to the urgency of climate change.
*  Just think about the moment we're in today.
*  The summer of 2023 will be the warmest ever recorded on planet Earth.
*  Last month in July in China, there was a town that recorded a temperature of 126 degrees,
*  the highest ever in the country.
*  And on that very same day, John Kerry, the US climate envoy, showed up in Beijing to
*  restart talks between the two world's largest emitters on climate change, because there's
*  no solution to climate that doesn't include the US and China.
*  And Kerry was largely rebuffed.
*  China didn't seem to have a lot of interest in talking with us, because we're in a moment
*  of some of the worst tensions between two of the world's great powers.
*  The world is shifting to clean energy sources that depend on a lot of minerals we'll talk
*  about that are very dominant, heavily concentrated in China.
*  Forces of fragmentation are growing at a time when we need more, not less, cooperation and
*  trade in clean energy.
*  There are growing forces of backlash from the developing world, lower income countries,
*  toward how the rich countries are approaching this problem.
*  So there are a host of broad geopolitical trends, challenges that are complicating the
*  effort to move as quickly as we need to to clean energy.
*  And the reverse is true, too, that the transition to clean energy, if we're not careful and
*  thoughtful about it, risks exacerbating some of those challenging geopolitical trends.
*  That has been a lot of the focus of what Megan and I have been collaborating on how to think
*  about.
*  Before we get to a lot of these different geopolitical dimensions, I also just want
*  to level set where we are just in terms of energy and the transition on an even more
*  basic level, because it sometimes feels like we're in something of a contradictory place
*  right now in the transition.
*  So on the one hand, over the last year, we've seen a flurry of really unprecedented clean
*  energy investments, right, including the Inflation Reduction Act here in the U.S.
*  And those investments are working with the fact that the price of wind and solar and
*  EVs have come down dramatically over the last decade, which means despite what's happening
*  this summer, we're on track for much better warming targets than just a few years ago.
*  And on the other hand, total emissions continue to rise.
*  Oil and gas demand hit a new record last year and is expected to hit another this year.
*  The fossil fuel industry is projected to spend more than $500 billion this year alone to
*  bring new oil and gas supply online, which, for context, the IRA was originally projected
*  to spend $370 billion over 10 years.
*  So where are we right now in the energy transition?
*  And how should we think about what feel like very contradictory indicators?
*  Well, I think it's a really insightful and astute question.
*  And I think for the reasons Megan talked about, the scale and magnitude of this challenge
*  and how unprecedented it is, two things can both be true at the same time.
*  When you look at where we are in clean energy, there is a lot to be excited about.
*  20 million EVs on the road, that figure is going to grow 35% this year.
*  The cost of solar, of wind, of batteries has fallen 80-90% in the last decade.
*  When you look at how much renewables we added in the last 20 years, we're going to do that
*  again in just the next five.
*  So on almost every metric you look at, we are exceeding many of our wildest expectations.
*  We're breaking record after record for the pace of clean energy deployment, for the pace
*  of clean energy cost declines.
*  And as you said, other than a pandemic or a recession, oil use is going up every year.
*  Coal use is going up, gas use is going up, and emissions are going up.
*  That's what happens when you take a global economy as big as the one we are, when you
*  have huge numbers of people around the world who use very little energy at all, when you
*  grow populations, when you give people higher levels of prosperity.
*  As much as we talk about the phrase energy transition, the history of energy is not one
*  of transition, it's one of addition.
*  And by that I mean, when we think of transitions, we think of going from wood to coal or coal
*  to oil, these great historic transitions that take decades to play out in the Industrial
*  Revolution.
*  That's true as a percentage of the total.
*  But what the planet cares about is not percentages of the total.
*  The planet cares about how much fossil fuels we're using and how much CO2 we're emitting
*  by burning them.
*  That number has never gone down.
*  We're using more wood today than we did in the 19th century.
*  That's because the denominator keeps getting bigger.
*  That's what happens when the amount of energy the world is using goes up because of rising
*  levels of income and rising populations around the world.
*  So if we want to have a clean energy transition that solves the climate crisis, we need to
*  do something we've never done before, which is not just have a transition where we add
*  a lot of clean energy and the percent of the total that is fossil fuels goes down.
*  We need the total amount of hydrocarbons to start going down and the emissions associated
*  with them to go down or otherwise be captured or stored.
*  To just reinforce the excellent point that Jason just made, last year, 2022, the world
*  used more coal than it ever has before.
*  Even though we're making these huge additions in renewable energy, that's basically simply
*  able to fuel the increase in energy demand that is happening globally.
*  It is again only in a recession or a pandemic that energy use has gone down.
*  You both have made the case that one way of thinking about this moment is that we're
*  leaving behind an age of energy security and entering an age of energy insecurity.
*  I want you to unpack that because in many ways, it seems like a decarbonized world would
*  be a much more energy secure world than one run on fossil fuels, right?
*  Oil and gas are these zero-sum resources concentrated in a handful of countries.
*  That means when Vladimir Putin decides to invade Ukraine or OPEC feels like prices
*  have gotten too low, you get all kinds of price fluctuations and shortages and so on.
*  But the sun and wind provide more than enough energy to power the world.
*  No country has a monopoly on them.
*  Italy seems like a greener energy system would also be a much more secure one.
*  Maybe we could start with you here, Megan.
*  What does that view get right and what does it miss?
*  I think that view is very accurate when we talk about the geopolitics or the security
*  of energy in a net zero world.
*  A world where we do have an energy sustainable global economy.
*  Often people assign the day 2050 to that.
*  Those are the global ambitions is to get to net zero.
*  I think it's true and Jason and I have written about this.
*  It is likely that that sort of world is more energy secure and there are fewer uncertainties
*  and potentially even less volatility.
*  What that portrayal misses, and this is something that Jason and I really are focused on, is
*  that the transition from, let's just say 2050 from today to 2050 is anything but smooth.
*  It's anything but incremental.
*  But actually there are all kinds of uncertainties and fluctuations and volatility in the system
*  making that transition because again, we're thinking about not a transition that is only
*  driven by the market, which would be in itself uncertain in some respects.
*  We're talking about a transition that has a huge element of geopolitics as countries
*  think about the energy transition as actually having competitive advantage.
*  We think about countries that look at the transition as something that's a threat to
*  and so you may have countries that want to thwart the transition and then you have others
*  that are seeking to expedite it.
*  So there's a huge element of policy, there's a huge element of geopolitics and there's
*  a huge element of technology.
*  All of these things come together to make the energy transition very uncertain in ways
*  that we can discuss, especially when we think about oil producers today.
*  How are they looking at the system and what does that mean for their relative power base?
*  In a net zero world, they're likely to have less geopolitical influence than maybe they
*  do today.
*  But that doesn't mean between now and then that it's a straight decline.
*  Instead, we've actually argued and we're seeing it now that these countries have enhanced
*  geopolitical influence and economic influence because of the nonlinear nature of this transition.
*  What you described, Roger, I think is absolutely the promise.
*  We are being reminded, if we needed any reminder, by the crisis that was prompted by Russia's
*  invasion of Ukraine, that if we shifted toward a clean energy system that was much more dependent
*  on electricity, more dependent on renewable energy, although not entirely, you'd have
*  less dependence on globally traded hydrocarbons that are inevitably exposed to geopolitical
*  risk.
*  So the urgency of climate is now matched with a growing recognition of the urgency of energy
*  security, which I think a lot of people forgot was a risk for many years.
*  The promise now is really to harness those two forces together to accelerate the move
*  faster to clean energy.
*  What Megan and I have been writing about are some of the risks that come with that transition
*  that she just described.
*  I think, as she said, they sort of fall into three buckets.
*  The first is the end state when we get to a net zero economy, and we are not on track
*  for that at all, but hopefully we get there.
*  That new clean energy system has its own potential risks.
*  Heavy dependence on critical minerals will come to that, I'm sure, most of that done
*  in China today.
*  A system that has much more solar and wind, which tends to be more variable, places much
*  greater strains on the grid in the need for flexibility to manage that.
*  So you've got to manage these things carefully.
*  As Megan said, that's many decades in the future, and the process of getting from here
*  to there, if we're not careful and thoughtful, can be messy and volatile and disorderly,
*  and that presents its own risks to kind of the legacy hydrocarbon system, not to mention
*  the emerging clean energy system.
*  And the third thing I would just mention is that climate change itself is going to be
*  a major threat to energy security in the coming decades.
*  Warmer waters, severe droughts make it harder to cool power plants or nuclear plants, can
*  affect hydropower output, even affect wind speeds.
*  So the impacts of climate change themselves can create risks to energy security.
*  The last thing I'll say is none of this is to suggest we should slow down the pace at
*  which we're moving to clean energy.
*  We need to move a lot faster as world events are reminding us this summer.
*  But it is important for us to be clear-eyed about what the risks are, because if we don't
*  navigate them, if we don't anticipate them, if we don't de-risk the transition, if people
*  see challenges with affordability or reliability to energy in the process of transition, there
*  could be a backlash.
*  I mean, you could lose support for the faster climate action we need.
*  So one area of the bumpiness that you both talked about on the path from here to a net
*  zero world is one that you alluded to, which is that the move to clean energy isn't going
*  to completely get rid of resource constraints.
*  It's just that the key resource constraint is going to shift to what you just referred
*  to, Jason, as critical minerals.
*  And you both just wrote this big report on critical minerals.
*  So tell me first what critical minerals are and how they are important to the energy transition.
*  But then more specifically, the most obvious analogy here is to say critical minerals are
*  the new oil.
*  So what does that analogy get right and what does it miss?
*  So the transition to clean energy depends heavily on these so-called critical minerals
*  like lithium and nickel and a range of things that are needed for clean energy, such as
*  batteries and solar.
*  They're used for a lot of other things, too, including the iPhones in our pockets and sensitive
*  defense requirements and other things.
*  But the kind of goals we're talking about to get to net zero emissions by 2050, the
*  projections are that demand for critical minerals go up something like sixfold.
*  We're not on track for our climate goals and copper demand is projected right now to double
*  by 2030.
*  These are huge increases.
*  And I think it is hard for people to fully appreciate the scale and magnitude of how
*  difficult it is to grow those supplies.
*  Today, it takes an average of 16 years to bring a new mining project to development.
*  And it's not easy to build mines all over the place.
*  And those have impacts.
*  They have impacts on indigenous communities if we're not careful, on the environment if
*  we're not careful.
*  And today, there is a lot of concentration of where those minerals come from.
*  If you look at oil, for example, the largest producers of oil, the U.S., Saudi Arabia,
*  and Russia each produce around 10 percent of world supply.
*  If you look at the largest producer of cobalt, of rare earth elements, the largest producer
*  each of those is more than 50 percent of world supply and most of 60, 70, 80 percent of the
*  refining and processing is done in China.
*  So there's a very heavy dependence on China right now in global supply chains that creates
*  a lot of concern about what happens if the whole clean energy system becomes dependent
*  on these minerals moving forward.
*  Let me pick up where Jason just stopped to answer the specific part of the question,
*  Roger, about to what extent is this a parallel to oil?
*  And obviously, oil is the easiest thing for people to get in their heads because this
*  is a physical commodity.
*  And so it is involved in geopolitics in a similar way.
*  And I'd say there are certain parallels, obviously, but the parallels break down in a couple of
*  ways.
*  I'd say the first thing is the most important thing is that the critical mineral is an input
*  into something else rather than the commodity itself that powers the economy directly.
*  So certainly, if the supply of these inputs are disrupted for political reasons, for natural
*  disaster reasons, supply chain, whatever the reason, it is going to have an effect on the
*  economy.
*  These critical minerals, the US in 2022 identified 50 of them.
*  These critical minerals are identified by definition, they have importance to America's
*  economic and national security interests.
*  So a disruption of supply would have an impact on our economy, but it wouldn't necessarily
*  be as pervasive as an oil embargo.
*  It wouldn't mean that our economy seizes up in short order.
*  It might be a little bit more like what we've experienced last year with chip shortages
*  and how that affects supply chains and increases the cost of anyone who rented a car or tried
*  to buy a car or lease a car, these types of things.
*  So it would have disruptions and some of those could be very concentrated in industries,
*  maybe the automotive industry, certainly in the world of defense where a lot of critical
*  minerals are used.
*  So that's the first thing is that they're different.
*  It's an input rather than the commodity that actually powers everything.
*  One difference as well is that actually in today's world, the production of these critical
*  minerals is much more concentrated than oil and gas.
*  And the US again, by definition, a critical mineral is one that we have heavy import dependence
*  on.
*  So for 15 of the 50 minerals, the US is reliant on imports for 100% of our consumption.
*  And for the other 35, it's more than half or about half.
*  And so this import dependency is problematic when you have a very concentrated number of
*  producers because when we think about how do we protect ourselves against anything that
*  may be disruptive, well, we have a diversity of suppliers.
*  That's what we tried to do when we were importing a lot of oils to have a diversity of suppliers.
*  But it's hard to do if the concentration of production is so focused on just a number
*  of countries.
*  And that's one of the reasons why some of the vulnerability is even more acute than
*  it might be when it comes to oil.
*  This brings us to the country that you all have mentioned a few times, which controls
*  a lot of these minerals right now, and that's China.
*  And here I want to pick up on one of the points you got out in the report, which is that it
*  doesn't really make sense to think of control of clean energy technologies, control of these
*  minerals and then what they create as one thing.
*  It's really sort of three separate components, right?
*  One is where the raw minerals are located, which, as you said, is highly concentrated.
*  But then two is sort of who has the capacity to process them into a form that's usable.
*  And then three, it's who has the manufacturing capabilities to take those processed minerals
*  and turn them into EV batteries or solar panels or whatever, which, as you alluded to, is
*  like one of the differences, I think, between these critical minerals and oil.
*  But China really dominates all three of these right now.
*  So just to put some numbers on it, different minerals are located in different places,
*  but China currently supplies around 70% of the world's rare earths, which are really
*  crucial for a bunch of clean energy technologies.
*  And then where China really dominates is processing and manufacturing.
*  For instance, China currently processes the bulk of the world's lithium, cobalt and graphite.
*  And Chinese companies currently control more than 75% of the world's EV battery and solar
*  PV manufacturing supply chains.
*  And so what you'll hear from lots of folks in the Biden administration, Jake Sullivan
*  has said things like this, John Podesta, is that they're worried that China could weaponize
*  its control over clean energy supply chains in the same way that Russia did with oil and
*  gas.
*  To your point, Jason, you know, it's only going to have more leverage.
*  It could possibly be even more painful because of how much of the market that China controls.
*  And already just last month, China announced export controls on two metals, gallium and
*  germanium, that are key inputs to solar cells, among other things.
*  And so the big question I have, and I'd love to start here with you, Megan, is how worried
*  should we be about China weaponizing these supply chains?
*  And how could it affect the energy transition if they do?
*  Let me make three points.
*  First, I think the world, the Biden administration, people in general, analysts, others, are right
*  to be concerned.
*  As you described very accurately, China has enormous dominance of these clean energy supply
*  chains right now.
*  And so then the question is, do they have the intention to use these for geopolitical
*  or other economic purposes?
*  And I think obviously there's some costs that would be borne by China if it did this, but
*  we have a couple of examples.
*  China's stoppage of the export of rare earth elements to Japan in 2010, when there was
*  a dispute over some islands in the East China Sea.
*  And then, as you mentioned, just a few weeks ago, we had two critical minerals and export
*  controls that China put in place.
*  So clearly they are inclined potentially to use this as they see it in their interest.
*  But they may not only use export controls or bans, they could also do something that
*  we found a lot of potential investors and manufacturers are worried about.
*  They could dump a lot of these critical minerals onto the global market at a critical moment.
*  And that could really, you know, viscerate some of the investments that people are making
*  in increasing the production and processing of these minerals in other parts of the world.
*  So they have the ability to create a lot of uncertainty in these markets in a way that
*  undermines investments and allows them to maintain their dominance.
*  So it's a legitimate concern.
*  My second point would be that we really need to look at this on a mineral by mineral basis.
*  The numbers that you suggested are very important and indicative of the leverage that China
*  could have.
*  But we have to go a deeper level because take for instance, copper and nickel, where China
*  processes 40 and 35 percent of global supply.
*  That's true.
*  You would think that gives them enormous leverage.
*  However, they use a huge amount of those minerals themselves.
*  So we have to look at are they actually exporters?
*  So they may be doing a lot of the global processing, but they may be consuming them themselves.
*  So they may not be exporting the minerals.
*  So we need to really separate out on a mineral by mineral basis where they have leverage.
*  And it's not across all 50 of these minerals.
*  It's more targeted.
*  And then we need to focus our action on those minerals that they have the processing capability
*  and they also are very influential in the global trade of those minerals.
*  So Rare Earth Elements is the most vulnerable spot.
*  And you gave us some good statistics on that.
*  And there you have China that does the production, the processing, and dominates the global export
*  market.
*  Lastly, the third point I'd make is, so what does this mean?
*  What are we going to do?
*  A lot of people have responded to these realities by saying, we've got to produce all this stuff
*  at home in the United States.
*  And I think there's no question in the task force that you referenced that Jason and I
*  co-chaired and just the report was just released in June.
*  The task force says, yes, we have to do a lot more to increase production in the United
*  States because we do geologically have a lot of these minerals.
*  But it also says, we can't fool ourselves to think that the United States is going to
*  be able to meet all of its own needs.
*  Even if the geology suggested we could, mining in the United States, there's a long history
*  we could go into it in great depth.
*  But there's a lot of social and political and environmental factors that will make it
*  hard for us to really mine everything that we could potentially mine in this country.
*  And so we have to think about how to work with others in order to get enough global
*  production that is not constrained in China.
*  And we also have to recognize that there is going to be a relationship with China that
*  is around these critical minerals and that we have to think about how to manage that
*  in a way because it is not going to be something that we're going to be able to replace, particularly
*  in the timeframe in which it's going to become really urgent.
*  Let me just add two quick points.
*  One on how worried we should be.
*  And she talked about the possibility of mining.
*  We should remember, at least from the standpoint of China, China's dominance for the most part
*  is about the refining and processing.
*  That's about manufacturing.
*  It's not about geologic abundance.
*  There's a lot of cheap oil in Saudi Arabia.
*  There's not a lot of cheap oil in many other places.
*  You can build facilities to do refining and processing of critical minerals in almost
*  anywhere.
*  It takes time.
*  It takes investment.
*  That doesn't happen overnight.
*  So it is a different kind of challenge than the geologic good fortune of nature about
*  where oil or gas supply is.
*  There's a question about how to think about the concern with critical minerals.
*  They're important for not just clean energy, as we talked about before, iPhones, almost.
*  We depend on China for a lot of pieces of the global supply chain.
*  And when you listen to administration officials, Jake Sullivan, for example, in an important
*  speech at Brookings recently talking about a small yard and a high fence.
*  And by that they meant we want a lot.
*  The administration is saying we want a lot of trade with China, but there's a small number
*  of things that are very sensitive, have national security or defense implications.
*  And in that area, we're going to try to distance ourselves and try to reduce our dependence
*  on China.
*  So the question is when you're talking about batteries or solar panels, where do they fall
*  on that spectrum?
*  How should we think about them?
*  Are they a commodity like everything else you need for your iPhone?
*  Or is there something particularly sensitive that would make us want to think differently
*  about that?
*  And I think the answer is wherever you put it on that spectrum, with energy security
*  generally, ever since Winston Churchill famously said, security in oil lies in variety and
*  variety alone, a big part of the answer is diversification.
*  That's part of the reason you're seeing Apple move iPhone production toward India and some
*  other places to reduce dependence on China.
*  Now as Megan said, diversification can't mean we do everything domestically.
*  It's simply not going to be possible and we can go into why we think that is.
*  So diversification means you need to be working with a lot of other partners around the world.
*  We need more free trade agreements, more trade partnerships at a time when protectionism
*  is in vogue and there's been a retreat on both sides of the aisle from support for some free
*  trade principles.
*  So we need to engage more with a very broad array of partners around the world.
*  We might want to think about other tools with oil, for example.
*  We have strategic stockpiles.
*  And I don't want to forget the fact that we should think about reducing demand.
*  You can recycle, you can use minerals more efficiently, and there's a range of electrochemistry
*  technologies in the works that might allow us to build a lot of these clean energy components
*  with far fewer inputs and that would be a huge win as well.
*  So for all the reasons you both just talked about, policymakers are really trying to quote
*  unquote, de-risk their clean energy supply chains from China.
*  And the way they've mostly gone about doing that is by building up domestic capacity.
*  So like the Inflation Reduction Act has all these provisions designed to help onshore
*  production of clean energy technologies to domestically source inputs like critical minerals.
*  Europe's Green Industrial Plan has a similar intent.
*  And as you're saying, you know, you both have been very sort of critical of this strategy.
*  But I think the response you get from folks in the Biden administration would go something
*  like this.
*  First, you know, integration is great in theory.
*  In an ideal world, we'd be able to rely on trade and cooperation.
*  But that's just not the world we're living in.
*  On one level, there are some countries willing to weaponize their resources.
*  But even beyond that, something we've seen over the past few years is that at the end
*  of the day, when there are massive shocks to global supply chains, countries tend to
*  look out for themselves and their people first.
*  And so if for some reason there's a shock that creates critical mineral shortages or
*  disrupts the battery supply chain, which is very possible, if that happens and we're dependent
*  on other countries for those things, then we're vulnerable, you know, we're exposed.
*  And so the only way to guarantee security for ourselves is to build thriving industries
*  right here at home.
*  And then there's also the political reality, right?
*  There's a reason Joe Biden's favorite line is what I think climate, I think jobs.
*  The voters Democrats need to win tend to see jobs in the economy as much higher priorities
*  than addressing climate change.
*  And so to be able to attach climate policy to jobs here at home is what allows these
*  policies to pass in the first place.
*  And it's also what helps protect them from backlash.
*  If you want to prevent a future Republican trifecta from repealing the IRA, you need
*  to create enough jobs in red and purple states such that it becomes politically disastrous
*  to do so.
*  And so, yeah, integration sounds great in theory, but the political realities both globally
*  and domestically are working against it.
*  And so I guess my question for you would be a sort of what your response to some of those
*  arguments would be, but then be what this more integrationist approach, this more cooperative
*  approach would actually look like.
*  It's a really insightful question.
*  And you're describing the tension the Biden administration is dealing with.
*  Industrial strategy is back in vogue.
*  And there is a lot to celebrate about that.
*  There's a lot of opportunity there for how we think about the economy, how we think about
*  the American middle class and how we think about the manufacturing base here.
*  And as Jake Sullivan said in that speech at Brookings, part of it is just that the assumptions
*  we had about how a globally integrated economy would work 20 or 25 years ago, China is not
*  playing by those rules.
*  And so we need to adjust our strategy accordingly.
*  I think one important area of a reality check on that is, and you've talked a lot about
*  this, you and Ezra on this podcast, how difficult it is to build at scale in this country.
*  And if we want to have a clean energy transition at the speed and scale we need, we should
*  do a lot more domestically, but it is going to be very hard for things like critical minerals,
*  for example, to do all of that here at home.
*  So if you veer too far in the direction of protectionism, that can undermine our ability
*  to move as quickly as we need to toward clean energy because it raises costs.
*  We need much more trade in certain clean energy technologies.
*  The IEA shows trade in critical minerals increases threefold in a scenario where we
*  meet our climate goals.
*  There's a range of studies showing that a big part of the decline we've seen in the
*  cost of solar photovoltaic modules has been because we've had global trade.
*  So we can't do everything at home.
*  We don't have the resources.
*  It takes a really long time to build.
*  We're going to need a lot of trade and there's a risk to cost inflation.
*  There's a risk to the energy transition.
*  If we're not working and engaged in global partnerships, then we need to think about
*  how to do that in ways that are secure and resilient.
*  Those are important goals.
*  But if security and resilience veer too far in the direction of protectionism or everything
*  has to be by America, that can be a risk, not just economically, but also can be a risk
*  to the pace of the clean energy transition because of what it means for some of the costs
*  of getting there.
*  So I would say when we talk about integration, and maybe I'm splitting hairs here, but we're
*  not saying let's leave this all to globalization.
*  This isn't a return to a world of no great power competition that we enjoyed for many
*  decades where globalization really took care of a lot of these things.
*  We're talking about greater integration with potentially a smaller set of countries, but
*  but more of a regional approach or an approach of countries that have, that are willing to
*  sign up to certain standards that are negotiated.
*  So that essentially, let's take critical minerals because we've been talking about that as an
*  example, that sure, it makes sense to do what we can to try to increase production in the
*  United States, but we can't do that with the expectation that we're going to meet all our
*  needs.
*  So it has to be complemented by an international approach that recognizes that a lot of the
*  mining and the processing and maybe even some of the manufacturing will happen in other
*  countries.
*  And how can we make sure that that growth is done in a way that is beneficial to all
*  parties?
*  And that will require pushing back on this protectionist impulse that we've had because
*  if we want countries, you know, in South America or in Africa or in other parts of the world
*  to increase their production and we want them to do them according to certain standards
*  that are consistent with American values, we need to find a way to get finance there
*  and likely we need to look at our trade relationships to ensure that there are markets for these
*  things.
*  So all of this is a web and in some ways it's good because we're in a world where there
*  can be things we agree on that push us in the direction of doing things that we might
*  not otherwise do.
*  So the fact that it's a bipartisan issue to compete with China, maybe that will be the
*  basis for us to do certain things that we wouldn't normally do not only in the domestic
*  world in terms of changing permitting and all that, but maybe in the international realm
*  in terms of getting agreements and maybe even negotiating or introducing the idea of market
*  access back into our economic tools in foreign policy.
*  Let's then talk about what this more integrationist approach could look like in practice.
*  Jason, you wrote this piece about a year ago when the IRA first passed, arguing that its
*  success would hinge on the foreign policy that went with it.
*  So walk me through the case you made there, but then also, you know, it's been about a
*  year now.
*  What has the Biden administration done well and what isn't it doing that it should be
*  doing?
*  The piece, I appreciate your calling it out.
*  I thought it was important to point out this is an extraordinary domestic achievement.
*  And that's the starting point, right?
*  We don't know if it's half a trillion or a trillion, but it is by far the largest investment
*  in clean energy in our nation's history, maybe any country's history at a time when the planet
*  is reminding us every day about the urgency of the climate crisis.
*  So the Biden administration has taken a much more significant step on climate than any
*  U.S. administration ever.
*  And that's an extraordinary achievement.
*  It is difficult to implement.
*  And again, on this podcast, you've explored a bunch of the reasons why it's hard to build
*  transmission lines and the land use that's needed, the permitting reform, how long it
*  takes to do things.
*  The point of the piece I wrote at the time was two points.
*  First, successful implementation requires not only domestic action, like permitting
*  reform, how we think about NEPA and environmental rules.
*  It requires successful foreign policy to avoid trade conflict with Europe so we can build
*  partnerships for things like critical mineral security, maybe so we could work collaboratively
*  now that we've taken this extraordinary climate action.
*  Europe is putting in place border tariffs for carbon.
*  They're thinking about things like climate clubs where some countries are in the club,
*  some are not, and you might face a tariff on your products if you're not.
*  We can now cooperate, hopefully, and we'll find ways to work together because we're taking
*  this extraordinary climate action.
*  We need, again, more trade agreements for all the minerals we're going to need.
*  So we need to diversify suppliers.
*  So successful trade policy, international economic policy is a vital part of the successful
*  implementation of our domestic achievement, which is the IRA.
*  But that domestic achievement is also about 12% of global emissions.
*  88% of global emissions are outside the United States.
*  And so what does it mean to take climate seriously for this administration or any administration?
*  It is not just about domestic policy.
*  It has to be about your international and foreign policy as well.
*  And I think there, when we think about climate diplomacy, it's extraordinary.
*  Someone like a former Secretary of State, John Kerry, is in charge of that.
*  But it's not just these annual UN meetings and can we reach agreements and promises to
*  do things, which, by the way, most countries are not following through on.
*  One of the major challenges now, in my view, is how do we accelerate clean energy deployment
*  in emerging and developing economies?
*  That's where the big growth is coming from in the next 20 years with emissions.
*  How do we lower the barriers to private investment?
*  How do we make more public investment available and use all the tools of international economic
*  policy, development finance corporation, export credit, or a range of tools the US government
*  has to try to lower the barriers to investment and accelerate how quickly we can put public
*  and private capital into getting clean energy built and in the ground in parts of the world
*  where it can be harder, the barriers are higher, the cost of capital is higher.
*  I think there the administration has done a lot, but frankly, we all need to be doing
*  a lot more, including the administration.
*  Let me broaden the aperture so we're not just talking about climate action, we're talking
*  about energy and climate action.
*  On the energy side, not that long ago, I think the Biden administration did a few things
*  that were extraordinary and were well done.
*  I'll just name a couple of them, but they're in relationship to, shockingly, something
*  we haven't really mentioned yet, which is the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the energy
*  crisis that triggered in Europe, but that cascaded to much of the world.
*  In terms of responses that the Biden administration did well, it helped facilitate a lot of LNG
*  flowing to Europe.
*  A lot of it was US LNG, and of course that was done by markets, but there was some diplomacy
*  involved to get LNG to flow from other parts of the world into Europe.
*  That was really important for Europe to be able to position itself much better and to
*  actually get off Russian gas more quickly than I think most people expected.
*  Secondly, there was the price cap that we're all familiar with, and Jason and I were kind
*  of skeptical about how well it was going to work, but I will certainly admit that it worked
*  much better than I expected.
*  That essentially there was a mechanism put in place, which seemed kind of confusing at
*  the time, but it essentially allowed for Russian oil to keep flowing to the global economy,
*  but to focus on trying to decrease the amount of revenues that Russia would get from those
*  sales.
*  That has been not seamless, but more successful than I think many could have anticipated.
*  Then lastly, when we're thinking about this whole issue of energy security and climate
*  action, the US relationship with Saudi Arabia is really critical to managing the global
*  economy because of the impact of Saudi Arabia and OPEC, of course, on energy prices.
*  That has been a very rocky relationship over the last year.
*  I think my sense is that both Riyadh and Washington are finding better ways of working together
*  and both accepting some new realities that hopefully can have a good impact on diminishing
*  some of the volatility that can be so pernicious to the global economy and to energy access
*  for the developing world as well.
*  I want to get to the developing world in a minute because I think that is one of the
*  key questions of the transition, is that question of financing that you mentioned, Jason.
*  But before we move on, I want to come back to China.
*  Let's say the Biden administration perfectly implements this integrationist, French shoring
*  approach, right?
*  We sign critical minerals agreements, we create climate clubs, we also clean up our act on
*  permitting and successfully build out a lot of battery factors and lithium mines, the
*  stuff of dreams, I know.
*  Even in that best case scenario world, how realistic is it to think we can fully disentangle
*  or de-risk from China when it comes to clean energy supply chains while also meeting our
*  decarbonization goals?
*  I think China is going to remain a very significant part of supply chains for clean energy for
*  a long time to come.
*  That's why it is important to think about de-risking and not decoupling, to use the
*  kind of language of the day.
*  It's not going to be possible to disentangle, to completely separate yourself, but there
*  are a number of steps that policymakers can take and individuals' companies can take to
*  think about how they reduce the risks of potential shocks.
*  And those could be conflict, those could be geopolitically motivated, they could be a
*  severe weather event.
*  I mean, any concentration and excessive risk in one location is a concern, as we've been
*  reminded following the pandemic.
*  So diversifying those supply chains, the possibility of strategic stockpiles, that's harder for
*  minerals because there's so many of them than say it is for oil, but we can think about
*  ones where it might make sense.
*  And I think there are a number of other lessons that can be learned from energy security,
*  from oil and the Arab oil embargo, the oil shock of the 1970s, the steps we took after
*  that.
*  Another one is governance, cooperation.
*  After the 1970s oil crisis, we built the International Energy Agency to provide more
*  transparency, more trusted data so markets could work more efficiently.
*  So if there is a disruption in supply, you can import from other sources, markets can
*  respond and adjust.
*  We had new mechanisms for cooperation between producers and consumers.
*  Those are a number of the lessons that can be learned from past energy shocks to try
*  to reduce the inevitable concentration that will continue to exist while we try to lower
*  it for China and the supply chains.
*  I'd just like to emphasize as we have another context on this podcast that two things can
*  be true.
*  One, it is unrealistic to think that we will, in your words, Roger, fully disentangle ourselves
*  from China when it comes to clean energy supply.
*  So I think that is truly unrealistic.
*  But at the same time, it is also true that it is an urgent need for us to try to move
*  in the direction of becoming more sufficient with the help of friends and partners and
*  allies around the world and that we should aggressively and creatively seek to minimize
*  our dependence on China.
*  So those two things, I think, are true simultaneously.
*  And I also think it's useful for us to just acknowledge there is a real tension here.
*  There is a real tradeoff here.
*  And this is what policymakers grapple with all the time, that you could either decide,
*  okay, we're going to continue to have this very outsized vulnerability to China.
*  If everything goes well, it is probably the fastest path to an energy transition, although
*  that everything goes well is a pretty big caveat.
*  Or we can say in our efforts to try to diminish that vulnerability to some extent, it may
*  be more costly and it may take a little bit of a longer time.
*  And I think that is what policymakers are grappling with and finding the right place
*  to be in that spectrum where you recognize there's going to be some element of vulnerability,
*  but you're also willing to pay potentially a little bit of a higher price or maybe slow
*  down things, hopefully not appreciably, but somewhat in order to allay that vulnerability.
*  It's a spectrum there.
*  And you see it's not just the United States that's grappling with that.
*  You look at India and India is thinking, we do not want to be completely reliant on China
*  for solar power and energy.
*  And so we're going to develop a lot of this here in India.
*  It's going to be more expensive.
*  It's going to take us more time, but we're not going to have that vulnerability.
*  And there's also benefits on that side that we already talked about.
*  If this helps with domestic manufacturing and domestic production and domestic economic
*  things, that's not only good for the economy, but it also helps build support in a constituency
*  for clean energy action.
*  That is consequential as well.
*  So I worry about where this leaves us though, because to your point, Megan, I think there
*  are going to be numerous points throughout this transition where we have to choose between
*  de-risking from China, disentangling from China and decarbonizing.
*  And I would love if we could all just be level headed and find the right balance between
*  those two.
*  But my worry right now is that the political headwinds are really stacked against decarbonization,
*  especially here in the U.S.
*  And when it comes to the politics here, Republicans are mostly united on wanting to be tough on
*  China and on not really caring that much about climate right now.
*  There wasn't a single Republican who voted for the IRA.
*  But Democrats are divided.
*  They really care about the climate, but they also don't want to be seen as catering to
*  China or promoting jobs in other countries.
*  And so you get things like earlier this year, an example that always comes to my mind, is
*  that a bipartisan group of legislators in Congress passed a bill that would have placed
*  tariffs on solar panels imported from Chinese manufacturers in Southeast Asia.
*  And the idea there was that this would support the American solar industry and the jobs it
*  could create here at home.
*  But the flip side is that the U.S. imports a lot of its solar supplies from these Chinese
*  companies, like a lot, which means these tariffs would have really raised prices and slowed
*  the decarbonization effort.
*  And so it was one of these moments when we had to make a choice.
*  And in the end, you know, Congress chose to pass the tariffs, but the Biden administration
*  ended up vetoing them for those reasons, which I think was the right choice, in part because,
*  you know, if we really care about decarbonization, the speed is really important and keeping
*  prices low is really important.
*  But as the anti-China momentum continues to build on both sides of the aisle in the U.S.,
*  I worry that those kind of decisions, the kind of decisions where we choose to prioritize
*  decarbonization, that those are going to get harder and harder to make and that the politics
*  of this issue are going to become more and more tilted against decarbonization and that
*  this would be really harmful to our ability to meet our climate goals.
*  And I'm just wondering how you all think about that concern.
*  Like, ideally, we'd be able to find some sort of balance.
*  But I worry that at least domestically here in the U.S., the politics are going to make
*  that harder and harder.
*  As long as we think about the way to make progress on climate as demanding cooperation,
*  particularly between the U.S.
*  and China, as long as we think that, I think we are in a mindset that is not going to bear
*  the fruit we're looking for, that we have moved away from a global environment where
*  the dominant dynamic is cooperation, which was actually the dominant dynamic for much
*  of the post-Cold War era up until, I don't know, the last five or ten years.
*  And so it made sense that we tried to approach climate in a cooperative manner.
*  It's a transnational problem.
*  And so it makes sense that cooperation would be the way in which we try to approach that.
*  And that has to do with the U.S.-China climate agreement.
*  That has to do with Paris.
*  It has to do with a COP.
*  All of those things made sense.
*  We're now in just an utterly different global dynamic.
*  We're in a different geopolitical moment where great power competition is the dominant
*  dynamic. And if we continue to think that climate is going to be some exception to that
*  and that we're going to have to find a way to cooperate in order to get to where we want
*  to go on climate action, I think we're doomed to fail.
*  That it's kind of irresponsible for us to think, oh, we need cooperation to get to where
*  we want to go and we don't have cooperation and we don't have good relations, then we're
*  not going to be able to get to where we want to go in climate.
*  And we need to think more about how do we harness the competitive element of this, not
*  just bilateral relationship, but really a global dynamic in order to leverage it to
*  advance where we want to be on climate.
*  And I think what this means a little bit more practically, I mean, the IRA is a perfect
*  example of that. So, Roger, you pointed out the agreement around being more competitive
*  with China between Democrats and Republicans.
*  And even though you didn't have Republicans vote for the IRA, there are going to be a
*  lot of Republican constituencies in the United States that benefit from the IRA.
*  And I think you could see some changes in support for such action.
*  But again, I think the idea of competing with China and one of the ways that we're going
*  to compete with China is on climate. It's not only going to be about Secretary Kerry
*  trying to get cooperative mechanisms.
*  We're going to compete with China because climate is one of those dimensions where
*  competition is going to be important.
*  And then it could lead us to think about we need to compete with China in terms of
*  building partnerships in the developing world for clean energy action, because that is
*  going to be an area of geopolitical advantage as well as economic advantage.
*  And if we can gain support for that, which otherwise I think wouldn't have a lot of
*  support in Congress for financing clean energy development in the developing world.
*  But if it can be seen in the lens of competing with China, then we might be able to get
*  somewhere.
*  I completely agree with Megan.
*  I think it's really important point.
*  And just to be clear about what we were saying, I don't think we're being Pollyannish or
*  saying policymakers should approach the international global economy the same way we
*  did in the early 1990s or when China was welcomed into the WTO.
*  And everything has to work that way.
*  Far from it. I think the point we were making was China is still going to be part of
*  these supply chains. That's a reality.
*  You want to reduce that. You want to de-risk it.
*  And there's a bunch of stuff you can do there.
*  But to your point, you asked about what does it mean for the priority of
*  decarbonization and how quickly that has to happen.
*  Of course, decarbonization is an urgent priority.
*  And we have other policy priorities, too, like human rights and forced labor,
*  intellectual property, cybersecurity.
*  And it is legitimate to think about all of these things while you're trying to
*  navigate your policy with China.
*  But I think what Megan said is very important.
*  We definitely need cooperation where it is possible.
*  It seems quite hard now and we shouldn't assume that it is necessary to make
*  progress. But if you think about the things that have been most consequential for a
*  clean energy transition in the last 10, 20 years, we talked about how quickly the
*  cost of solar has come down, of EVs and batteries has come down.
*  That was a lot because China made an industrial strategy decision to dominate
*  those industries and drive the cost down.
*  They did that for reasons of competition.
*  If you read Joe Manchin's statement of support for the Inflation Reduction Act,
*  it was not about climate change.
*  It was about U.S. competitiveness and the health of our domestic economy and our
*  energy security. And that competition to own some of these areas, to be stronger in
*  some of these emerging clean energy technologies, was a powerful motivator for the
*  most significant piece of climate legislation that we have passed.
*  And when you think about the things we have to do in the developing world to make more
*  capital available for how those countries will evolve, you look at the Belt and Road
*  Initiative China has put forth.
*  As Megan said, you can build, hopefully, build bipartisan cooperation because this is not
*  just about climate change.
*  This is about America's place in the world, about China's place in the world.
*  And those forces of competition, if we're smart, can be harnessed to drive a faster
*  transition at the same time that we're trying to put in place a bunch of tools to increase
*  energy security, increase our resilience, reduce the risks of the fact that, as we talked
*  about, China will still be a major player in a lot of these supply chains for a long
*  time.
*  We've been talking a lot about the West and China, but as you both have mentioned a few
*  times now, whether or not we hit our climate goals really comes down to what happens in
*  the developing world.
*  I've seen estimates that by 2030, the developing world, even excluding China, will account
*  for the majority of annual carbon emissions.
*  So tell me, how is the energy transition going in the developing world?
*  And what are the major obstacles or hurdles that we still need to overcome there?
*  The energy transition in the emerging and developing economies is not going nearly
*  fast enough.
*  And it's hard to overstate how important these parts of the world are.
*  First, we should say what matters for climate change is the total emissions that have accumulated
*  over time, historic emissions, not just the annual flow of emissions.
*  Half of that comes from the US and Europe, around 2 or 3% from Africa.
*  So you're talking about parts of the world that historically have not contributed to
*  the problem that we're confronting today.
*  At the same time, when you look at where we're headed going forward, there's around two dozen
*  countries or so between now over the next 20 years that if they develop in the same
*  carbon intensive way that China did over the last 20 years, you're talking about the same
*  growth in emissions and the possibility of reaching goals like one and a half or two
*  degrees Celsius is almost impossible.
*  And I'm not talking about the lowest income countries, sub-Saharan Africa, where there's
*  a very important story that we have to focus on for energy access to be able to use clean
*  cooking fuels, people who use almost no energy at all.
*  Talking about emerging market countries, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, that are
*  growing incredibly rapidly.
*  And there's no just ethical or pragmatic way to have an energy transition if we don't help
*  people around the world who enjoy just a fraction of the standard of living that we do.
*  You have a better standard of living and that requires more energy use.
*  But we have to figure out how to do that in a way that is lower carbon than has been the
*  case in the past.
*  This year, we'll invest around $250 billion globally in clean energy in the emerging and
*  developing economies.
*  If we were on track for our climate goals, that number should be seven times higher,
*  $2 trillion.
*  So you're talking about huge amounts of capital.
*  Most of that will be private, but public capital has a role to play to help de-risk and catalyze
*  that private capital that has to be put to work expanding the deployment of clean energy.
*  And there are a lot of different and larger risks to doing that.
*  We've done a lot of work at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia, for example, on
*  currency exchange risk, which is one of the barriers to putting capital to work there.
*  How might we overcome that with some innovative mechanisms?
*  The cost of capital is about seven times higher in these parts of the world than it is if you're
*  looking at the developed world.
*  So there's a lot of action that we need to be taking and government leaders need to be taking
*  to reduce some of those barriers so we can put capital to work in parts of the world that are
*  going to need to use a lot more energy.
*  They're using almost very little energy today.
*  So I think it's worth us trying to reflect a little bit of the anger that exists in the
*  developing world and in emerging markets around this whole issue of the energy transition.
*  Because many leaders in speaking with us have emphasized, you can't transition when you don't
*  actually have energy.
*  So before we are asked to transition to a different kind of energy, we need to have more energy.
*  Obviously, the objective is that they would have more energy, but it would be of a clean energy
*  nature.
*  But for the developing world or for much of the developing world in the emerging markets,
*  it is a question of energy access, which seems to trump the issue of climate.
*  And so this goes back to our initial point about how energy security and climate action
*  need to go hand in hand because you can't just talk to the developing world about climate and
*  decreasing carbon emissions without talking about increasing energy access.
*  And just to put a few numbers on what Jason was talking about, so if you're in sub-Saharan
*  Africa, you may be well aware that only 2% of the emissions in the world today come from
*  sub-Saharan Africa compared to a quarter from the United States, more than a quarter from Europe.
*  And so there is a real feeling of injustice that part of the world that is not responsible for
*  virtually any of the carbon emissions in the system today is bearing the brunt of climate
*  change on the ground.
*  So there's a frustration there.
*  I've heard a lot of frustration over what is perceived as hypocrisy, that when energy
*  security issues are dominant in the developed world, there is a rush to try to build more
*  energy infrastructure that may rely on fossil fuels, whereas there's a continued message to
*  the rest of the world to don't build that kind of infrastructure.
*  So I think when we get at this whole question, the developing world, there are some of the
*  realities that Jason underscored really well, but there's a real anger which is being amplified,
*  not just by the energy transition, but by the multiple geopolitical crises that are affecting
*  the developing world, whether it's the food crisis or the energy crisis or global inflation,
*  or the many things that are coming out of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that are having a
*  big impact much further afield than Europe.
*  I really appreciate the way you have all brought in how this all looks from the perspective of
*  these developing countries.
*  Because as you pointed out, I think one of the core injustices of this transition is that the
*  countries who have contributed the least to global emissions are often the ones bearing the
*  greatest brunt of the damage of climate change.
*  And then we in the rich world who are responsible for creating the problem in the first place have
*  the audacity to turn around and tell these countries that they aren't allowed to grow their
*  economies the way we did, that we aren't going to fund their natural gas projects, that they need
*  to go green, even as we are importing more coal and building more LNG infrastructure and trying
*  to drill for more oil in the wake of the Russia's invasion.
*  But at the same time, it is generally agreed that we have to find some way for these countries
*  to continue to grow while also transitioning to clean energy.
*  And it doesn't seem to me that that's impossible.
*  Kingsmill Bond at the Rocky Mountain Institute has estimated that in 90% of the world, renewables are
*  already the cheapest source of new electricity, and they're only getting cheaper.
*  I know that's probably a little bit of a bit of an optimistic estimate, but it's in the ballpark,
*  I think.
*  You know, a lot of these countries, sunlight is far more abundant than in other places.
*  There are all kinds of health benefits.
*  And so I guess what I'm wondering is, is there a necessary trade-off here between these countries
*  growing in the ways that they want to, in lifting people out of poverty on the one hand,
*  and on the other hand, having a green energy transition?
*  Or are there things that we can do either with financing or otherwise to make it so that both
*  of these can happen at the same time?
*  I would say it's not at all pie in the sky to think that these two things can be compatible.
*  I mean, not only is it that ambition, but it's almost the imperative, because energy access
*  and done so in a climate-friendly way is really the holy grail here.
*  And again, this is possible, but there are some gaps that are really preventing it from happening
*  at the speed and the scale in which it needs to happen, both to meet the needs of people
*  in the developing world and to address climate.
*  And some of that has to do with the risks surrounding investments.
*  And we've mentioned finance a lot, but the finance piece is huge.
*  And there are just risks associated with investing in clean energy projects in the
*  developing world that don't exist in the developed world.
*  As Jason mentioned, we need to increase by sevenfold and more in out years of the finance
*  that is flowing to the developing world.
*  And this is going to have to be done through creative partnerships where, again, as Jason said,
*  mostly private capital, but likely there needs to be some de-risking of that capital with public
*  money or philanthropic money.
*  So it is basically closing that gap that makes it sensible for more investment to flow there.
*  One point that I think is important when we think about this holy grail vision of growth
*  and growth in clean energy circumstances is just the reality right now, because renewables are
*  intermittent.
*  It is hard to build industry off of sources of energy that are intermittent.
*  So when you talk about the sun shining and the wind blowing in all parts of the world,
*  that's true.
*  But we have to have either duplicity of energy sources so there is more dependency or, obviously,
*  much more storage capability.
*  Because if you're going to develop an industry that can be the backbone of development for a
*  country, it's not just being able to charge your cell phone when the sun is shining.
*  It's something much more fundamental than just providing certain access to electricity to parts
*  of the world that haven't had it yet.
*  Aaron Norris Totally agree with Megan.
*  It is a false choice to say that we have to care about poor people around the world or care about
*  climate change.
*  It is, and that's not what we're arguing.
*  I hear that sometimes.
*  If you care about the world's poorest, we just have to ignore climate and continue to use fossil
*  fuels going forward as we have in the past.
*  That is not the right solution.
*  It is fair to say the pace of transition in a multi-decade transition may look different in
*  different parts of the world.
*  The U.S. is still getting 20% of its electricity from coal.
*  We might think about the different issues of equity in different places and how they develop.
*  It is also important to be honest about the scale of the challenge and where we are today.
*  Numbers like in 90% of the world, the cheapest source of energy is renewables.
*  I think there are some optimistic assumptions.
*  When you look at what's actually happening in the world today, India is a good example.
*  I'll give one more statistic that I think is illustrative.
*  India has a goal to install 500 gigawatts of installed renewable energy by 2030.
*  These are huge increases.
*  Last year was a record year for wind and solar capacity additions in India.
*  If you want to get to that goal, you need to take last year's record number and triple it
*  and do that every single year between now and 2030.
*  It would mean building the equivalent of India's largest solar park every four weeks from now
*  until 2030.
*  If they do that, coal use in India in 2030 is the same as it is today.
*  That is what it means to take the most populous country in the world
*  and grow their economy and grow their population.
*  The challenges of meeting economic growth in these parts of the world
*  and doing it purely with zero carbon energy are really hard.
*  The numbers are really big.
*  That's why we need to be honest about it and not just say renewables are cheaper.
*  So just go do it.
*  We need to work a lot harder.
*  We need a lot more international finance.
*  We need the World Bank to be working harder.
*  We need governments in a lot of parts in the world, including the US administration,
*  to be working harder.
*  We need private financial institutions to be working harder to overcome the barriers
*  to investment in those parts of the world that Megan talked about.
*  Can I just say one thing?
*  Just based on what Jason said, that really fantastic and sobering example of India
*  underscores the point that this transition is not just about solar and wind and renewables.
*  The world is not going to get to the place it's trying to go simply with renewables.
*  There are requirements for many other sources of energy,
*  some of which are more contentious like nuclear energy.
*  There's going to need to be a role for carbon capture, for new energy sources like hydrogen.
*  Essentially, in order to close the gap that Jason described,
*  it can't be all done with renewable energy.
*  That's part of the realization I think that people are coming around to.
*  That does mean that there are a lot of energy sources that we've hardly touched on today
*  that are going to be so important.
*  If you think about the question of technologies, the IEA says that we have the technologies we
*  need to get to our goals in this decade, but we still need to develop new technologies in
*  their commercialization for the out decades of the energy transition.
*  A lot of that is still to come.
*  It seems like what you are both circling in a lot of ways is that the key bottleneck to
*  threading this needle between growth and greening in developing countries really comes down to
*  financing. Part of my question is why this is so hard.
*  Jason, I was listening to a podcast you did earlier this year with Larry Fink,
*  the head of BlackRock.
*  If anyone is going to know what it takes to get the financing right and the investment right,
*  it's him. You asked him how we're going to get the capital we need for the developing world,
*  and he said he had no idea.
*  That was really disconcerting for me.
*  Why is this question of financing so hard?
*  If there are any ideas that seem promising, because I think the current theory is like,
*  the best thing we could do for the developing world is to invest a lot in bringing down the
*  price of clean energy technologies like wind and solar.
*  Megan, you were saying we're investing a lot in hydrogen.
*  We're investing in carbon capture. That's what the IRA is meant to do.
*  By bringing the cost of these down, that will trickle out to the rest of the world.
*  It seems like there's a lot more financing that's going to be needed, and that there's
*  some real difficulties in getting that financing.
*  I'm just wondering what those difficulties are, whether there are any ideas that seem
*  promising on those fronts.
*  I remember asking Larry Fink that question.
*  You mentioned one of the answers that the Biden administration has given and would give,
*  and I think it's a fair one. It's not sufficient, but it's fair, which is
*  one of the things the Inflation Reduction Act will do in the same way that the efforts that
*  China took over the last 10, 15 years, again, for reasons of industrial policy and economic
*  competitiveness to drive down the cost of solar, of batteries, to make it cheaper for all of us
*  to use. What the IRA will do with a suite of technologies, as Megan said, half of the
*  cumulative emission reductions between now and 2050, according to the International Energy
*  Agency, come from technologies not yet commercially available.
*  We need hydrogen and low carbon fuels. We need carbon capture. We need a range of
*  technologies. If you lower the cost of those through early investments like the IRA,
*  you make it lower costs for the rest of the world to pick up.
*  True, but not sufficient. We're not even making good yet on the promises
*  rich countries made a decade ago to provide $100 billion in climate finance
*  to low income countries. Let's make good on our commitments. We need more, and we need to think
*  about a creative range of tools. In the US government, for example, it's not nearly
*  sufficient, but there's something called the Development Finance Corporation. They put
*  government capital to work to incentivize private investment for a range of reasons,
*  including some of the national security reasons we talked about before.
*  You can look at certain tools we have in the US government. We need more of those tools,
*  and we need to allocate more capital. There's a lot of big discussion going on about world bank
*  reform now and how the world bank can put more capital to work to de-risk and lower the barriers
*  to private capital, because we have to remember most of those trillions of dollars, there's just
*  not enough government money. Most of that is going to have to be private capital. If you're looking at
*  a renewable project in Europe, or you're looking at a wind project in, I don't know, Vietnam or
*  another South Asian country or in Africa, there's just different, and there's more barriers,
*  currency exchange risk being one of them. There's political risk. There's a range of risks that
*  make you more concerned, and I think you want to de-risk those and lower some of the barriers so
*  that the huge amounts of money we need from private capital, there's a lot of private capital out
*  there, multi-billion dollar funds that are looking to invest in the energy transition.
*  We need a lot more of that going into lower income countries around the world.
*  AMT – Part of the answer to that question, I think, returns to the concepts we've been talking
*  about, about harnessing the competitive relationship between the US and China to spur action that is
*  going to advance the energy transition. The developing world is certainly one area where
*  I can imagine that happening. What does the world look like where China has been the country that
*  has financed a lot of the energy systems in the developing world and emerging markets? What kind
*  of world is that? What are the geopolitical implications of that world? Are they such that
*  American policymakers and legislators want to make sure that doesn't develop? I think it's
*  getting a different frame around providing financing or de-risking financing to the
*  developing world. As Jason has said a couple of times on the show, this is not going to be done
*  with public money, but it can be done with the help of public money. Getting people to look at
*  this more as a critical national security interest rather than something that's altruistic or
*  something that makes sense purely on climate grounds, I think is going to be essential to
*  getting the kind of action that will be necessary to try to expedite some of the flows of finance
*  to the developing world. As Jason said, on another note, there are a lot of initiatives that are
*  trying to look at this. Some of the initiatives that have come out of the cops of the last couple
*  of years, the World Bank under new leadership, really trying to ask questions about how do we
*  have to change our lending model or our overall quote unquote business model so that we're meeting
*  these needs in the developing world. We're taking riskier bets in order to advance these kinds of
*  interests in the developing world and emerging markets. I want to end by looking forward.
*  We've talked about a lot of the complications, the tensions, the problems that could accompany
*  this energy transition, but let's say it's 10 years from now, it's 2033. What's the best
*  case scenario for where we could be at that point and what would have to happen for us to get there?
*  So when I think about the best case scenario for where we might be in 10 years, I don't think about
*  a particular metric or temperature point or something like that doesn't come to mind.
*  I actually have in mind a completely different approach than the one that we've been taking thus
*  far that really builds on the reality that we've been discussing. That the world is in a geopolitical
*  moment of fragmentation, of competition, of protectionism, and the energy transition is
*  both a cause and a consequence of that or casualty of that environment. To me, what a great position
*  for the world to be in in 10 years time would be where, I'll just take the US because we're American
*  here, but where American policymakers and other policymakers would think about approaching the
*  energy transition not only as a goal, like this is something we want to get to a net zero world,
*  but also to acknowledge that the energy transition and global politics are deeply intertwined and
*  that what we do on the energy transition influences geopolitics and vice versa, which is really where
*  we started this podcast. So that we would not only have a strategy that would help us get the
*  necessary climate action, but it would be one that would also have an impact on geopolitics
*  and would assuage some of the worst elements of the geopolitical fragmentation that we see.
*  To think about the energy transition not just as an end, but also as a means to try to address
*  some of these issues. The best example that we've talked about so far today has been that of trade.
*  Maybe we actually get a pullback from this embrace of protectionism because we've crafted
*  a climate strategy that demands we have some level of greater integration on trade because
*  it is required. So where you have this kind of like beneficial cycle between climate action
*  and geopolitical forces rather than where I think we are now, where we have more of a downward spiral
*  of the energy transition reinforcing fragmentation, reinforcing a slowdown in the energy transition.
*  So thinking about how we could create an upward spiral rather than the downward spiral we seem to
*  be in right now. Yeah, I think when I look out a decade from now, I do think a little bit about
*  some of those metrics for being on track for our climate goals. By that point, hydrocarbon use would
*  have peaked and people would anticipate long-term decline somewhere close to the goals we've been
*  talking about. We're so far away from being on track for that today that the question is what
*  would have to change in order to sort of get on track? And I think we're going to need a lot.
*  We've been talking about the techno-economic and policy stuff. We need finance and we need the
*  technology costs to come down. We need the sense of urgency about this transition to go up. And I
*  think when you look at history of environmental movements or other social movements, they don't
*  move in a linear fashion. And when we think about the kind of impacts of climate we're seeing around
*  the world today, the potential for broad scale social mobilization to have its own tipping points
*  where we have to, people are sort of demanding solutions much more quickly that would be there
*  a decade from now. And then I think that can take two forms. And one form is one where there's a
*  collective sense to work together to put in place the kind of policies we need and move toward a
*  world of clean energy. It can take a very disruptive form with the kind of severe climate impacts that
*  you might see in low-income parts of the world that are least able to deal with this. And then
*  we have that backlash from the developing countries because of what they're dealing with and the
*  insufficient funding they have to deal with it. That gets worse. The potential for energy price
*  volatility. And we know from experience that when fuel prices go up, whether it's yellow vest
*  protests in Paris or uprisings that topple the government in Sri Lanka, there can be a political
*  backlash to that. So these risks of a disorderly transition that Megan and I have written a lot
*  about, that would be a concern. Either the world is just status quo and we're not doing anything
*  about climate change and that has its own risks. But if we start to accelerate the energy transition,
*  which I hope we do, the risk a decade from now would be that starts to take quite a disruptive
*  and disorderly form that increases, not decreases, conflict between countries, conflict over
*  resources, increases tensions between rich and poor countries around the world. And I think that's
*  why we've been spending so much time in our work thinking about how to anticipate what those risks
*  are. Again, not to move slower on the transition, but to take steps today to reduce those risks so
*  we don't run into those kinds of challenges. Well, I think that is a perfect place to end.
*  The last question we always ask on the Ezra Klein show is for book recommendations. We usually ask
*  for three, but because there are two of you, I will ask for two each. So Jason and Megan,
*  what are some books you'd recommend to the audience? Well, I've been lucky that one of
*  my mentors has been Dan Jurgen and anyone who's spent their career in energy. Most well known for
*  being a former guest of the Ezra Klein show. He is. I listened to the episode. Dan Jurgen's
*  Tour de Force, the prize is a really classic work about the central role energy, particularly oil,
*  has played in global power and geopolitics for more than a century. Lord Curzon famously said
*  after World War I that the Allies floated to victory upon a wave of oil. Winston Churchill
*  shifted the British Navy from coal in nearby Newcastle to petroleum from far away places
*  like Persia because it was a superior fuel in his view. But that created a host of new national
*  security and geopolitical and diplomatic challenges. And I think as we mark the 50th
*  anniversary of the Arab oil embargo, this obsession with energy security has shaped so much of energy
*  policy. You really get a sense of that from the prize and the work that Megan and I do together
*  is to think about how the future of energy geopolitics might unfold. What would the prize
*  of the next 50 years look like? Not that we could aspire to write such an extraordinary
*  Pulitzer Prize winning book. The second that we've talked a lot about today is about this gap
*  between ambition and reality. The ambition being the urgency of the climate crisis. The reality
*  being that the world's using more and more hydrocarbons every day and how quickly or how
*  that might change. Earlier this year I had COVID. I was in isolation for a week and I got a huge 800
*  page history of the modern American environmental movement by the American historian Douglas
*  Brinkley called Silent Spring Revolution. It's a really fantastic book. But what really comes
*  across in those pages is not just the importance of environmental protection and it is useful to
*  go back and remember how bad the damage was to the air and the water quality in the United States,
*  all the damage we did in the decades after World War II or even before. But also what struck me
*  in reading the book was how quickly all of that came to a head. We talked about there was a lot
*  of work on this. There was the famous book Silent Spring and then it kind of all in the late 60s,
*  1970 and the first Earth Day came to a head where one in ten Americans came out into the streets
*  in the first Earth Day in 1970 and said, we just can't live like this anymore. This has to stop.
*  Ernest Hemingway once wrote of a character in one of his books who was asked how he went bankrupt
*  and the character replied in two ways, gradually and then all of a sudden.
*  And I think Brinkley's book really shows how history tells us climate action might proceed
*  along a similar course as we see temperature indexes, combinations of temperature and
*  humidity indexes that are the summer broaching the limits of human survival.
*  Jared Suellentrop Thank you. And Megan?
*  Megan McLaughlin I think it says more about the energy
*  reading landscape than it says about Jason and my partnership. But I, of course, had the prize as
*  one of the two books that I would recommend for all the reasons that he suggested. And I think
*  anyone who works in geopolitics and energy, that would be the first one that they would recommend.
*  But let me mention another book or two. So one of the books I wanted to mention was Kevin Rudd's
*  book called The Avoidable War, the dangers of a catastrophic conflict between the US and Xi
*  Jinping's China. And it came out last year. In some ways, you know, it's not a book about energy
*  per se, but it is a book about this relationship that has been part of our entire discussion,
*  the relationship between the US and China and written by someone. So Kevin Rudd is now
*  Australia's ambassador to the United States, but he is a sinologist. He has lived in China,
*  speaks fluent Mandarin. He's somebody who knows China and knows the US very well,
*  but is neither Chinese nor American. And it is just a very deep and I think realistic portrayal
*  of the relationship and of the impulses of the leaders and the systems there and an assessment
*  about how this relationship could become one of conflict, but also a practical book in the sense
*  of saying, here are some steps that can be taken to mitigate those risks. And I think it really
*  does have a lot to do with the climate issue and with energy, generally speaking, because that
*  this US-China relationship, both the competitive nature and the prospect of a better relationship,
*  I think, really bowed directly to the issues that we've been talking about today.
*  In the other book, since I won't come to the prize, I think that many of your listeners
*  might enjoy reading Bill Gates, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster. Unlike Kevin Rudd's book,
*  which is a lot about policy and geopolitics, Gates's book is a lot about technology,
*  but it's also practical in the way it's sort of empowering in the sense of describing here the
*  ways in which everybody can contribute to a successful energy transition. So I find that
*  to be, you know, for somebody who's embarking on this, maybe not from a point of expertise,
*  but from a point of kind of potential activism. I think it's a great book to read.
*  Well, Megan, Jason, thank you so much for being here. I can't wait for your book to come out
*  because I feel like I learned so much in this conversation and we'll continue to learn from
*  you. Thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you, Roger. And we feel really honored that
*  we are your last guest on the show. Thank you for the invitation. Really, really enjoyed the conversation.
*  Thanks so much for listening, everyone. As I mentioned in the intro, this is my last episode
*  of the show. And it truly is bittersweet. This truly has been the experience of a lifetime.
*  So I couldn't be more grateful to Ezra for giving me the opportunity to play such a key role on the
*  show and for his mentorship over the years. And to the truly amazing team I get to work with every
*  day. I came for the book recs, but the people are really what have made this experience so special.
*  And on that note, I also just wanted to thank you all, the audience, because the reason we on
*  the show get to do what we do every day is because of what a gracious, curious, open-minded audience
*  you all are. In terms of my next steps, I will be starting as a staff writer at The Atlantic,
*  covering economic policy. And I hope I can continue to interact with a lot of you through
*  the work I do there. And so I guess I'm just excited to be getting back to being a listener again.
