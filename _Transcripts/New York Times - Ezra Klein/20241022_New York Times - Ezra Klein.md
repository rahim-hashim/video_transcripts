# Ezra Klein on What’s Wrong with Trump
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxA3mLuwzp8)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  You've probably seen the clip by now.
*  Donald Trump is holding a town hall.
*  It's Monday, October 14th in Pennsylvania.
*  He's being asked softball questions by Kristi Noem, the Republican governor of South Dakota.
*  And there's a medical emergency in the crowd.
*  The rally stops for a while.
*  They play Ave Maria while the medics respond.
*  Then Trump and Noem begin again.
*  Then someone else in the crowd needs medical help.
*  The rally stops again, begins again.
*  Noem is settling back in to ask questions when Trump announces he's had enough.
*  What comes next is something I've never seen before.
*  Swing dreamily to his playlist in front of a rally full of people.
*  For nearly 40 minutes.
*  It was like he was DJing his own bar mitzvah.
*  You can look in these clips at the faces of the people around him like Noem.
*  They really have no idea what to do.
*  They're suddenly backup dancers in a concert that shouldn't exist.
*  Now part of me finds Donald Trump's behavior here unusually relatable.
*  You think I want to sit up here talking about politics and war day after day?
*  You don't know the temptation to just once, just for one week, turn this podcast into
*  a drum and bass set or play some of my favorite Chiasmo songs.
*  But I don't.
*  Of course I don't.
*  It's not what we're doing here.
*  And if I were a presidential candidate in the final weeks of a campaign, I wouldn't
*  do what Trump did because the fallout would be predictable.
*  An avalanche of media coverage asking what the hell was that?
*  It does raise the question of why?
*  What was that?
*  What was going on there?
*  And then you want to answer more questions.
*  I don't even know how many dozens, hundreds of campaign events I have covered in my career.
*  I have never seen anything like this.
*  I've never seen a candidate do anything like this.
*  I think by now I have the experience and discernment to say with the deepest gravity, last night's
*  Trump town hall was banana pants, boo boo bonkers.
*  I wouldn't do it because of the inevitable attacks that would come from my opponents
*  about this strange behavior I just exhibited on stage.
*  Here's Tim Walls.
*  I would not usually encourage you, but we're doing it now.
*  Go watch this guy right now and go watch these rallies or this town hall.
*  He stopped taking questions and stood frozen on stage for 30 minutes while they played
*  his Spotify list to people.
*  It was strange, but if this was your grandfather, you would take the keys away.
*  You would take the keys away.
*  I don't think Walls has this right.
*  Trump did not freeze up on that stage.
*  He did not lose where he was in the moment.
*  If anything, he was all too present.
*  But Walls is saying something Democrats really want to hear right now.
*  There are so many Democrats, I think you can imagine that I hear from them all the time,
*  who are furious still about the difference between the way the media treated Joe Biden's
*  age and the way it is treated Donald Trump's age.
*  The diminishment of Biden's capacities led to unrelenting coverage and concern from the
*  media and from Biden's own party that ultimately drove him from the race.
*  Every time he flubbed a name or a place, every time his voice was quiet or thick and clotted,
*  every time a sentence derailed before it reached its intended station, a frenzy over Joe Biden's
*  fitness would rise.
*  But Donald Trump at 78 is nearly as old as Joe Biden.
*  He exhibits his own cognitive irregularities.
*  He rambles and he lies and makes things up and seems to get strangely lost in these digressions.
*  His speech is associative and circular.
*  It can read like gibberish on the page.
*  And he goes on these bizarre rifts like this one, which is somehow about the dangers of
*  electric boats.
*  I say, what would happen if the boat sank from its weight and you're in the boat and
*  you have this tremendously powerful battery and the battery is now underwater and there's
*  a shark that's approximately 10 yards over there.
*  By the way, a lot of shark attacks lately.
*  Do you notice that?
*  A lot of shark.
*  I watched some guys justifying it today.
*  Well they weren't really that angry.
*  They bit off the young lady's leg because of the fact that they were not hungry but
*  they misunderstood who she was.
*  These people are crazy.
*  He said there's no problem with sharks.
*  They just didn't really understand a young woman's swimming now.
*  It really got decimated and other people too.
*  A lot of shark attacks.
*  So I said, so there's a shark 10 yards away from the boat, 10 yards or here.
*  Do I get electrocuted if the boat is sinking, water goes over the battery, the boat is sinking?
*  Do I stay on top of the boat and get electrocuted or do I jump over by the shark and not get
*  electrocuted?
*  Because I will tell you, he didn't know the answer.
*  He said, you know, nobody's ever asked me that question.
*  There is this fury among many Democrats about the past they feel Trump has been given.
*  And I've struggled with this myself.
*  It's not that Donald Trump's age is unknown or that in the media it is uncovered.
*  But I can tell you that even when we do write about it, it doesn't connect in the same way.
*  The media doesn't actually set the agenda the way people sometimes pretend it does.
*  The audience knows what it believes.
*  If you are describing something they don't really feel is true, they read it and they
*  move on or they don't read it at all.
*  And I don't think people believe and to be honest, I don't believe that the core problem
*  with Donald Trump's mind is his age.
*  Over four years, we really did watch age change Joe Biden.
*  It made him different than he'd been before.
*  But is that what has happened to Donald Trump?
*  Is he different than he was before?
*  Because I would say Donald Trump in 2024 is like Donald Trump in 2020 and like Donald
*  Trump in 2016.
*  I don't think he's so much changed as he is distilled.
*  But this is where the critics are right.
*  We had the language to talk about what was happening to Joe Biden.
*  Age is a delicate topic, but it's one we know.
*  And so we did talk about it.
*  We spoke about it relentlessly.
*  But we've never had good language for talking about Donald Trump.
*  We've never had good language for talking about the way he thinks and the way in which
*  it is different from how other people think and talk and act.
*  And so we circle it.
*  We imply it.
*  I don't think it's biased so much as it's confusion.
*  In order to talk about something, you need the words for it.
*  But for me, at least, something clicked watching him up there swaying to that music.
*  You may have heard of the big five personality traits.
*  Openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism.
*  We all fall somewhere in the spectrum of each of them.
*  I've taken these psychological tests and I score really about as high as you possibly
*  can on conscientiousness and agreeableness.
*  And if we're really being honest here, I'm above average on neuroticism too.
*  I was talking to a psychologist about this when I was researching this piece.
*  And when I told him that, he told me that's a really good combination for being very productive
*  and very anxious.
*  Yeah, sure is.
*  I mentioned though that these traits are spectrums.
*  Some of the newer personality frameworks, they name the other side of the spectrum too.
*  So to be low on neuroticism is to be high in emotional stability.
*  To be low on extraversion is to be introverted.
*  And to be low on conscientiousness is to be disinhibited.
*  To be very low on conscientiousness is to be very high on disinhibition.
*  And that is Donald Trump.
*  I want to tread carefully here.
*  For years now, there's been a cottage industry of books diagnosing Trump with this or that
*  psychological malady.
*  And the view that Trump's psychology borders or tips into the pathological, it's not limited
*  to his critics.
*  John Kelly, Trump's second chief of staff, is known to have bought the book, The Dangerous
*  Case of Donald Trump.
*  27 psychiatrists and mental health experts assess a president seeking insight on the
*  man he served.
*  Mick Mulvaney, Trump's third chief of staff, he recommended aides read the book, A First
*  Rate Madness, uncovering the links between leadership and mental illness.
*  He thought it would help them understand the way Trump's strange psychology, maybe even
*  his mental illness, helped make him a powerful and unique leader.
*  There are strong reasons, though, that we in the media and that psychiatrists in general
*  are careful with this kind of language.
*  There's a rule in psychiatry that you don't diagnose patients you have not directly examined.
*  That rule comes from politics.
*  It is called the Goldwater rule because they did that to bury Goldwater and got sued and
*  lost.
*  The history of pathologizing political leaders we do not like is not an admirable one.
*  And so I'm not a psychiatrist, and I am saying something much simpler and I think more neutral
*  here.
*  Trump moves through the world without the behavioral inhibition most of us labor under.
*  And when I say that, I am describing both what is wrong with Donald Trump and what is
*  right with him.
*  One thing I have learned as I've gotten older is that every person's strengths are also
*  their weaknesses.
*  Disinhibition is the engine of Trump's success.
*  It is a strength.
*  It is what makes him magnetic and compelling on a stage.
*  It is what allows him to say things other people would not say, to make arguments they
*  would not make, to try strategies they would not try.
*  It's easy to forget that in 2016, Jeb Bush seemed likely to win the Republican nomination,
*  perhaps to win the White House.
*  Much of the top talent in the Republican Party had worked for a Bush in some form or another.
*  And yes, plenty of Republicans thought, often privately, that George W. Bush's presidency
*  had been a failure.
*  They thought the Iraq war had been a mistake.
*  But you could not succeed as a Republican unless you tread carefully around that.
*  Or so went the thinking of almost everyone back then.
*  And then someone proved it completely wrong.
*  George Bush made a mistake.
*  We can make mistakes.
*  But that one was a beauty.
*  We should have never been in Iraq.
*  We have destabilized the Middle East.
*  But so you so I mean, so you still think he should be impeached?
*  I think it's my turn, isn't it?
*  You do whatever you want.
*  You call it whatever you want.
*  I want to tell you, they lied.
*  They said there were weapons of mass destruction.
*  There were none.
*  And they knew there were none.
*  There were no weapons of mass destruction.
*  Let me state what everybody knows.
*  There are many things politicians believe they do not say.
*  The norms of politics, the norms of simple politeness, suppress much that people feel.
*  And not just politicians.
*  There are vast swaths of political opinion that you're not really supposed to talk about.
*  A lot of people believe that immigrants are bad and dangerous and that we shouldn't have
*  so many of them in this country.
*  That free trade is ripping this country off.
*  And it's the fault of these corrupt idiots in Washington lying in their own pockets.
*  That China isn't our ally or our partner.
*  It's our enemy.
*  And that the great threat to America comes from within.
*  That other Americans are disloyal.
*  That they are the enemy.
*  And the power of the state should be turned against them.
*  It's not that no one else in politics held these views before Donald Trump.
*  But for the most part, it's not how they spoke about them.
*  That was the part of the system that Trump exploited.
*  The market failure he saw.
*  The lie that just because politicians didn't talk this way, voters didn't feel this way.
*  One of Trump's verbal tics is to say, many people are saying.
*  But it's often the opposite.
*  He's saying what many people want somebody to be saying.
*  He's saying what many people might be saying in private, but often are not saying in public.
*  One argument that Trump supporters make is you don't get Trump's honesty without his
*  outrageousness.
*  You don't get a leader who can break the mold by supporting a person who conforms to the mold.
*  Here's Kellyanne Conway at the 2024 Republican National Convention.
*  How often do we hear, I want Trump's policies without Trump's personality.
*  Well good luck with that.
*  We don't get those policies without that personality.
*  And she's right.
*  You certainly don't get his politics without his personality.
*  How many people must want to do what Trump has done?
*  How many millionaires and billionaires and celebrities must have thought to themselves,
*  I'd be a good president.
*  I'm smarter and more charismatic and better on a stage and wiser than these idiots up
*  there.
*  Forget them.
*  How many times have you felt insulted or wronged by someone and want to just unload on them
*  in public?
*  To go all out in annihilating your tormentor in every way you could.
*  How many times in your work or your life have you believed something other people didn't
*  believe?
*  Something they thought was wrong or impolite or outdated or ridiculous and you bit your
*  tongue.
*  You didn't want to say it and be laughed at, mocked, dismissed, punished.
*  But we hold ourselves back.
*  Most of us do.
*  And so when I say this, I mean it.
*  What Donald Trump has done is remarkable.
*  It is historic.
*  It is unique in the entire history of American politics.
*  To run as an outsider to a political party, to then capture that political party totally,
*  break its fundamental consensus, slander its previous standard bears, to then become president
*  having never held elected office or served in the military and do that while saying things
*  and doing things that until you, everybody believed you could not do or say in politics.
*  To achieve something unique, you must yourself be unique.
*  Donald Trump is unique.
*  Over the years, I've interviewed, I don't know how many politicians and talking to them,
*  it's different than talking to really anybody else.
*  That's why I don't just fill the show with them.
*  Politicians are inhibited.
*  Before anything comes out of their mouth, they are running their response through this
*  internal piece of software.
*  Some of them are really good at it.
*  Pete Buttigieg, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama.
*  The software is so fast and efficient as to be almost seamless.
*  The politicians we sense to be inauthentic.
*  It's often that the software is slower and buggier.
*  You can see the seams.
*  You can watch the calculations happening in real time.
*  But what that software is doing in all these cases is inhibiting.
*  It is running their words through a filter of what they shouldn't say given who they
*  are and what they are doing and the weight their words carry.
*  If your words move markets and launch missiles, you choose them carefully.
*  But there is something undeniably electric about watching someone unchained from the
*  bundle of inhibitions the rest of us carry around.
*  Watching someone just say it.
*  There's something even aspirational about it.
*  What if I was without fear, without doubt?
*  If I can't be without fear, if I can't be without doubt, what if I could at least be
*  led by somebody who was?
*  Protected by somebody who was?
*  Fought for by somebody who was?
*  It is Donald Trump's absence of inhibition that makes him a great entertainer.
*  It is Trump's absence of inhibition that makes him feel to so many like not a politician.
*  The fact that he was already the US president not withstanding.
*  It is why the people who want to be like him, the mini Trumps, the Ron DeSantis' and
*  Blake Masters' and Ted Cruz's, they can't really pull it off.
*  Because what makes Trump Trump isn't his views on immigration, though they are part of it.
*  It's this manic charisma born of his disinhibition.
*  It is his great strength.
*  It is also his terrible flaw.
*  Sometimes Trump's disinhibition gets you a willingness to call a failed presidency,
*  a failed presidency.
*  To call a lie that took us to war a lie.
*  But sometimes it gets you this.
*  Somebody should run against John McCain, who has been, you know, in my opinion, not so
*  hot and I supported him.
*  I supported him for president.
*  I raised a million dollars for him.
*  It's a lot of money.
*  I supported him.
*  He lost.
*  He let us down.
*  But you know, he lost.
*  I never liked him as much after that because I don't like losers.
*  But Frank, Frank, let me get to him.
*  He hit me.
*  He's not a war hero.
*  He's a war hero.
*  He's a war hero.
*  He's a war hero because he was captured.
*  I like people that weren't captured.
*  OK, I hate to tell you.
*  Do you agree with that?
*  He's a war hero because he was captured.
*  OK, you can have and I believe perhaps he's a war hero.
*  But right now, he said some very bad things about a lot of people.
*  disinhibition is yoked to a malignancy at his core.
*  I do believe he's a narcissist.
*  If Putin praises him, he's going to praise Putin.
*  If John McCain mocks him, he's going to mock John McCain.
*  Donald Trump doesn't see beyond himself and what he thinks and what he wants and how he's
*  feeling.
*  He doesn't listen to other people.
*  He does not take correction or direction.
*  Wisdom.
*  Wisdom is the ability to learn from experience, to learn from others.
*  But Donald Trump doesn't really learn.
*  He once told a biographer, when I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself
*  now, I'm basically the same.
*  The temperament is not that different.
*  And you know what?
*  I believe him totally when he says that.
*  In 2018, Donald Trump told The Washington Post, quote, I have a gut and my gut tells
*  me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.
*  Imagine going through life, truly believing that truly acting like that.
*  And then imagine that in so many ways it has worked for you.
*  It has made you rich and famous and powerful beyond your wildest dreams.
*  What would that do to you?
*  What does that do to a person with a mind like Donald Trump's?
*  Here is the question Democrats have floundered in answering this year.
*  If Donald Trump is really so dangerous, then how come the consequences of his presidency
*  weren't worse?
*  There is this gap between the unfit, unsound, unworthy man Democrats describe and the memories
*  that most Americans have of his presidency, at least before the pandemic.
*  If Donald Trump is so bad, why were things so good?
*  Why were they at least okay?
*  There is an answer to this question.
*  It's that as president, Trump was surrounded by inhibitors.
*  In 2020, the political scientist Daniel Dresner published a book entitled The Toddler in Chief.
*  The core of the book was over a thousand instances Dresner collected in which Trump is described
*  by those around him in terms befitting an impetuous child.
*  These quotes about Trump abound.
*  They're given on the record sometimes, on background other times.
*  They're given to various biographers and reporters.
*  Some of them are later disputed as the staffer realizes the consequences of what they have
*  said, but there are reams and reams of them.
*  For every one I offer here, I could give you a dozen more.
*  In 2017, his deputy chief of staff, Katie Walsh, described working with President Trump
*  as, quote, trying to figure out what a child wants.
*  Steve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist, said, quote, I'm sick of being a wet nurse for a
*  71 year old.
*  James Mattis, Trump's first secretary of defense and John Kelly, later Trump's chief of staff,
*  they often describe themselves like babysitters.
*  They made a pact to never be overseas at the same time, lest Trump do something truly deranged
*  before they could stop him.
*  Here's a title of a 2017 article in Politico, White House aides lean on delays and distraction
*  to manage Trump.
*  The first paragraph reads, quote, as White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus muse
*  to associates, that telling President Donald Trump no was usually not an effective strategy.
*  Telling him next week was often the better idea.
*  In 2018, the New York Times published a bombshell op-ed by an anonymous member of the Trump
*  administration who said he, a Republican, was part of an internal resistance to Donald
*  Trump, in which, quote, many of the senior officials in his own administration are working
*  diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations,
*  end quote.
*  That author later revealed himself to be Miles Taylor, the chief of staff of the Department
*  of Homeland Security.
*  In a 2020 interview with ABC, Taylor described the lengths he and others took to shield America,
*  to shield their own staff from the commander-in-chief's whims and rages.
*  The president at the time would get into these phone rants with us, the secretary and myself,
*  about Jerry Brown and how frustrated he was with Jerry Brown and later Gavin Newsom because
*  they didn't support him and he didn't feel like he had a base of supporters in California.
*  So as wildfires were burning down houses in the state, the president basically said
*  to us, I don't care.
*  These people haven't done enough to deserve it.
*  Cut off the money.
*  In fact, that phone call that I referenced with FEMA officials, the secretary and I were
*  so concerned because we didn't want our senior leadership to be exposed to how undisciplined
*  and tumultuous the White House was because it made it harder for them to do their jobs.
*  So after that call, FEMA officials said, what do we do?
*  The president has just told us to cut off money to people whose homes are burning down.
*  Our answer was, we're not going to do it.
*  Don't worry, we'll go back to the president.
*  But then George, months after it, again in January 2019, the president said he wanted
*  to do it.
*  The Trump administration was rife with this sort of thing.
*  In 2019, a senior national security official told CNN's Jake Tapper, quote, everyone at
*  this point ignores what the president says and just does their job.
*  The American people should take some measure of confidence in that.
*  During his presidency, Trump repeatedly proposed firing Patriot missiles at suspected drug
*  labs in Mexico.
*  He mused about launching nuclear weapons at other countries and in one very strange case,
*  at a hurricane.
*  He talked often and insistently about his desire to turn the machinery of the government
*  against his domestic political enemies.
*  He talked often about pulling out of NATO.
*  He mused about the efficacy of untested or dangerous treatments for COVID.
*  In 2020, during the protests following George Floyd's murder, Trump raged at his staff demanding
*  they turn the full force of the military against the protesters.
*  Here's Mark Esper, who served as Trump's secretary of defense on 60 Minutes.
*  I thought that we're at a different spot now.
*  He's going to finally give a direct order to deploy paratroopers into the streets of
*  Washington D.C. and I'm thinking with weapons and bayonets, and this would be horrible.
*  What specifically was he suggesting that the U.S. military should do to these protesters?
*  He says, can't you just shoot them?
*  Just shoot them in the legs or something.
*  And he's suggesting that that's what we should do, that we should bring in the troops and
*  shoot the protesters.
*  After Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, he refused to admit that loss, perhaps refused
*  to even believe in that loss.
*  I'm personally persuaded by the reporting that he'd come to believe very weird theories,
*  both of fraud and that he could be reinstated as president.
*  And yes, there is a part of all of us that resists believing in our own defeat.
*  So many politicians who have been voted out of office would have preferred to ignore those
*  results, to claim fraud and cling to power.
*  Not all of them, certainly.
*  Most of the people who serve in politics, on some level are patriots.
*  They understand that the peaceful transition of power is sacred and that their ambition
*  is comparatively profane.
*  But even the politicians who are not patriots recognize the likely outcome of fighting the
*  results of a fair election.
*  Dishonor, defeat, possible prosecution.
*  Trump did not care.
*  He was unrestrained by those inhibitions.
*  He tried in every possible way he could to overturn the election.
*  He called state election officials and demanded they find votes for him that did not exist.
*  Here is Trump threatening Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state, in a phone call
*  that later leaked.
*  The ballots are corrupt and you're going to find that they are, which is totally illegal.
*  It's more illegal for you than it is for them because you know what they did and you're
*  not reporting it.
*  That's a criminal offense.
*  And you can't let that happen.
*  That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer.
*  That's a big risk.
*  But they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what I've heard.
*  And they are removing machinery and they're moving it as fast as they can, both of which
*  are criminal fines.
*  And you can't let it happen.
*  And you are letting it happen.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I'm notifying you that you're letting it happen.
*  So look, all I want to do is this.
*  I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more that we have.
*  And it didn't end there with state after state refusing to bend its results to Trump's whims
*  or beliefs.
*  Trump then demanded his vice president, Mike Pence, refused to certify the election.
*  Pence certified it anyway.
*  When a mob stormed the Capitol, chanting in part, hang Mike Pence, Trump did nothing.
*  He watched it on television.
*  Even now, knowing everything we know about that day, the people who died, the people
*  who were injured, how close we might have come to a massacre in the halls of Congress.
*  Here is how Trump describes it.
*  The vice president, I disagree with him on what he did.
*  I totally disagreed with him on what he did.
*  Very importantly, you had hundreds of thousands of people come to Washington.
*  They didn't come because of me.
*  They came because of the election.
*  They thought the election was a rigged election, and that's why they came.
*  Some of those people went down to the Capitol.
*  I said, peacefully and patriotically, nothing done wrong at all, nothing done wrong.
*  And action was taken, strong action.
*  Ashley Babbitt was killed.
*  Nobody was killed.
*  There were no guns down there.
*  We didn't have guns.
*  The others had guns, but we didn't have guns.
*  What is remarkable to me about Trump's answer, which Trump just gave last week at a Univision
*  town hall, is it doesn't even serve his interests.
*  He needs to reassure people about this.
*  And that's the problem with lacking the restraint that most of us have.
*  That restraint helps us act strategically, carefully.
*  When I described the way politicians calculate their answers earlier, I wasn't insulting
*  them.
*  There is a reason they do that.
*  When JD Vance showed up at the vice presidential debate as a kinder, gentler, more accommodating
*  version of himself, all that anger and contempt sanded off, he did that for a reason.
*  He inhibited himself to achieve his goals.
*  But Trump has no ability to do the same.
*  That's why he lost the debate with Harris so decisively.
*  When he is pressured, when he is emotional, he can't stop himself.
*  He can't inhibit himself.
*  Here he is on Fox and Friends being lobbed an easy question, a softball about making
*  nice with Nikki Haley, whose help he could really use right now, whose help has been
*  offered to him.
*  She wants to help.
*  She said, if he calls me, I'm there.
*  You guys used to be tight.
*  In the last 18 days, will you call her and say, come out with me?
*  Yeah, I'll do what I have to do.
*  Let me just tell you, Nikki Haley and I fought and I beat her by 50, 60, 90 points.
*  I beat her in her own state by numbers that nobody's ever been beaten by.
*  I beat Nikki badly.
*  I beat everyone else too badly.
*  Look, if you want to see Trump lose the 2024 election, that answer is perfect.
*  But if you want to see him win it, which he does, which his staff does, that answer is
*  insane.
*  The man cannot help himself.
*  He is missing the part of his mind that tells him what not to say, what not to do.
*  He may be cunning and intuitive.
*  He may know how to work a room and command a crowd.
*  He may know how to spy the weakness in another person and dominate them.
*  But he cannot control himself.
*  The best argument you can make about Trump's first term is that there was a constructive
*  tension between his disinhibition and the constraints of the staff and the bureaucracy
*  and the institutions that surrounded him.
*  Yes, some of his ideas were bad and dangerous and unconstitutional, but they mostly didn't
*  happen.
*  They were stopped by his aides, by the so-called deep state, by the courts, by civil society.
*  And the way he pushed, the way he didn't constrain himself to what other presidents
*  would have done or said, maybe that led to changes that, at least if you agree with him,
*  were positive.
*  Changes that wouldn't have happened under another president.
*  Tariffs on China, a sharp drop in border crossings, NATO allies spending more on defense.
*  Now the people around Trump have spent four years plotting to dismantle everything that
*  stopped Trump the first time.
*  That's what Project 2025 and the nearly 20,000 resumes it reportedly vetted is really all
*  about.
*  That's what Trump's inner circle is spending its time and energy doing.
*  Don Jr. told The Wall Street Journal, quote, we want people who are actually going to follow
*  the president, the duly elected president, not act as sort of unelected officials that
*  know better because they don't know better.
*  End quote.
*  He went on to say that, quote, we're doing a lot with vetting.
*  My job is to prevent those guys.
*  I've heard this from a number of people preparing for a second Trump term.
*  Personnel was a problem in the first.
*  Vetting for loyalty is now the answer.
*  Don Jr. was one of the people who reportedly persuaded Trump to pick JD Vance.
*  Back in May, before Vance was chosen, but when he was known to be under consideration,
*  when he was clearly running for the job, he sat down with my colleague, Ross Douthat,
*  who asked him an interesting question.
*  When Ross asked, did Vance decide that he actually liked Donald Trump?
*  Vance said that it was when he first met Trump in 2021.
*  Trump told him this story about being deceived by his generals about troop levels in the
*  Middle East.
*  Vance said that the conversation made him realize Trump was deeper than he'd been given
*  credit for.
*  And Vance realized, quote, I was deeply offended by this.
*  Talk about a threat to democracy.
*  The generals not listening to the president of the United States about matters like troop
*  deployment.
*  Vance is one of many now who have made it their mission to see that Trump's future
*  orders are carried out, no matter their content.
*  If Trump was constrained by others in his first term, Vance wants to make sure the same
*  does not happen in a second term.
*  And Vance has been arguing this for some time.
*  Here he is in 2021, again, arguing that the true threat to democracy isn't Trump trying
*  to overturn elections or Trump doing dangerous things in office, but Trump's will being frustrated
*  by the bureaucracy around him.
*  The administrative state controls everything, right?
*  So to the point that like when Donald Trump wins, he can't even sometimes get his people
*  in core positions of authority in the administrative state.
*  It's like, well, do we have a constitutional republic?
*  The founding fathers actually created a very powerful chief executive, a very powerful
*  president.
*  But if he can't even fire the people in his own administration, like, is this really a
*  successful republic?
*  The thing to see here is that Trump supporters want to have it both ways.
*  They point to what didn't happen in his first term as proof that the same or worse will
*  not happen in his second term.
*  But they themselves are trying to remove everything that stopped Trump's worst impulses from becoming
*  geopolitical or constitutional crises.
*  Here, for instance, is Vance speaking at the vice presidential debate.
*  Remember, he said that on January the 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully.
*  And on January the 20th, what happened?
*  Joe Biden became the president.
*  Donald Trump left the White House.
*  And now, of course, unfortunately, we have all of the negative policies that have come
*  from the Harris Biden administration.
*  Fine.
*  But then here at the All-In conference, is Vance describing what would have been different
*  if he'd been the vice president on January 6th?
*  I think that Mike Pence could have played a better role, yes.
*  But again, the two purposes that I take issue with is, one, Pence was not asked to overturn
*  the election.
*  He couldn't have.
*  But two, the reason-
*  He was asked to not certify it.
*  Sure.
*  So would you have certified?
*  I'll ask you for the third time.
*  Again, I would have asked the states to submit alternative slates of electors and let the
*  country have the debate about what actually matters and what kind of an election that
*  we have in these important states.
*  You wouldn't have certified it, to be clear.
*  I would have asked the states to submit alternative slates of electors.
*  That's what I would have done.
*  I am not here to tell you that Donald Trump's age is not a problem.
*  He would be, upon his inauguration, the oldest president ever to assume the office.
*  Recently, he's begun cancelling scheduled interviews, his staff apparently citing exhaustion.
*  And we know that aging can make disinhibition worse.
*  The August 2020 edition of the Journal of Psychology and Aging, maybe you read it, was
*  entirely devoted to research on how the ability to control our behavior appears in many studies
*  to decline as we get older.
*  It's hard, for me at least, not to think of that research when I read that Trump's
*  rallies have stretched to an average of 82 minutes, up from about 45 minutes in 2016.
*  Trump's ability to energetically ramble on a stage is often used as evidence of his continued
*  vigor.
*  I think it's the opposite.
*  I think his inability to stop rambling on a stage is evidence that what little capacity
*  he once had to control himself is weakening.
*  And what else are we to make of riffs like this one?
*  But Arnold Palmer was all man.
*  And I say that in all due respect to women, and I love women.
*  But this guy, this guy, this is a guy that was all man.
*  This man was strong and tough.
*  And I refuse to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros, they came out of there
*  and they said, oh my God, that's unbelievable.
*  And come on, the final weeks of a campaign?
*  But Trump's age is not what worries me most.
*  This was not a man possessed of much restraint in 2016 or 2020 either.
*  What has changed even more than Donald Trump are the people and the institutions around
*  him.
*  The leader of the House Republicans is Mike Johnson, not Paul Ryan.
*  Mitch McConnell is stepping down from Senate leadership.
*  And while I do not consider McConnell a profile in courage, his successor will be more in
*  need of Trump's patronage than he was.
*  Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, for all their flaws, they're out, while Don Jr. and Laura
*  Trump are in.
*  J.D. Vance wormed his way onto the ticket by promising to do what Mike Pence would not.
*  Elon Musk is doing everything in his power to buy influence, centrality even, in another
*  Trump administration.
*  The Supreme Court has given Trump immunity from prosecution for official presidential
*  actions.
*  Republicans have spent four years plotting to take control of the administrative state,
*  to stock it with loyalists who would never, ever do anything to impede Trump and turn
*  the entire machinery of the government to Donald Trump's whims.
*  Donald Trump is not cognitively fit to be president.
*  The presidency requires an occupant able to act strategically and carefully.
*  That Trump is not such a person is obvious if you watch the man.
*  And so for years his supporters have said, don't watch the man.
*  Don't listen to what he says.
*  Look at the results.
*  But those results reflected the power and ability of others to check Donald Trump, to
*  inhibit him when he could not inhibit himself.
*  It is not just a man who is now unfit.
*  It is the people and the institutions that surround him.
*  Here is one difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
*  The people who work most closely with Joe Biden, his top staff, his cabinet appointees,
*  they have always said he is up to the job of the presidency.
*  Fit cognitively, fit morally.
*  The people who worked most closely with Donald Trump, many of his cabinet secretaries, many
*  of them now say he is not, that he never was.
*  I think that whoever we elect in 2024 has to meet a number of criteria.
*  Number one, they have to put country over self.
*  Number two, they have to serve with integrity, with principles.
*  Number three, they have to be able to work with other people.
*  They have to be able to unify the country and lead.
*  And President Trump just doesn't meet that for me.
*  I'm not going to vote for him.
*  I did vote for him in 2016.
*  I looked at the alternatives and concluded that it was worth voting for him, considering
*  the alternative being Hillary Clinton.
*  But after 17 months of serving in the White House, I cannot in good conscience do that again.
*  I saw firsthand how unfit Donald Trump is to serve as president again because of his
*  unwillingness to call off the mob that day and his refusal to this day to accept the
*  results of the 2020 election.
*  Between me and my former running mate, I cannot endorse President Trump's continuing assertion
*  that I should have set aside my oath to support and defend the Constitution and acted in a
*  way that would have overturned the election.
*  The Republican Party today is, in my view, completely unrecognizable from what it was
*  10, 12 years ago.
*  It's been completely warped and tarnished in Donald Trump's image.
*  And he has essentially elected a body of enablers in both the House and the Senate
*  to do his bidding.
*  But to admit the obvious is to be excommunicated.
*  It is to go from being one of Trump's amazing hires to one of his deranged enemies, a loser,
*  someone he fired.
*  And so he is now surrounded by yes men and enablers, by opportunists and scam artists,
*  by ideologues and foot soldiers.
*  What we saw on that stage in Pennsylvania, as Trump DJ'd, was not Donald Trump frozen,
*  paralyzed, uncertain.
*  It was the people around him, frozen, paralyzed, uncertain.
*  Donald Trump knew exactly where he was.
*  He was doing exactly what he wanted to do.
*  But there was no one there or no one left who could stop him.
