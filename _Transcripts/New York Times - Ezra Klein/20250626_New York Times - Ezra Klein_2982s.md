# Where Does Trump's Bombing Leave Israel, Iran and the US? | The Ezra Klein Show
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto)
*  For decades, Israel has wanted the support of the US in bombing the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=0.0s)]
*  And for decades, every single US president has said no. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=5.84s)]
*  I have always said that all options are on the table, but the first option for the United States [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=10.32s)]
*  is to solve this problem diplomatically. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=14.72s)]
*  Military action would be far less effective than this deal in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=16.88s)]
*  Do you support an attack on Iran nuclear sites by Israel? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=22.96s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=26.48s)]
*  And then, last week, one, President Donald Trump said yes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=30.48s)]
*  Breaking news, and after days of uncertainty, the United States have completed [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=35.44s)]
*  three strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=40.4s)]
*  Its mission accomplished for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who thanked President Trump today. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Your bold decision to target Iran's nuclear facilities [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=50.56s)]
*  with the awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=54.64s)]
*  Iran's response came in the form of a missile strike targeting Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=59.6s)]
*  the largest US military base in the Middle East. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=65.76s)]
*  Experts call this attack mostly symbolic. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=68.56s)]
*  Qatar did get a heads up hours in advance. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=71.44s)]
*  Seconds ago, the president went to True Social and typed this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=73.92s)]
*  It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a complete and total ceasefire. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=78.64s)]
*  The mutual ceasefire between Israel and Iran is now officially in effect, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=86.16s)]
*  but it appears the terms might have already been violated this morning. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=89.84s)]
*  You know what? We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=93.68s)]
*  that they don't know what the fuck they're doing. Do you understand that? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=99.44s)]
*  How much damage has been done? This is a real question. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=103.44s)]
*  It's also a political question. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=107.44s)]
*  The Defense Intelligence Agency has assessed that the core components of Iran's nuclear program [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=109.2s)]
*  are largely intact and that Iran's nuclear program has essentially only been set back by months. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=115.6s)]
*  So why did Donald Trump say yes? And what are the long-term consequences of that decision [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=121.2s)]
*  going to be? My guest today is Aaron David Miller, who worked on negotiations and policy [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=126.08s)]
*  in the Middle East across four successive presidencies from 1985 to 2003. He's since [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=132.4s)]
*  written a number of excellent books on the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=138.56s)]
*  American leadership, and he's a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=143.6s)]
*  He joins me to talk through what all this has meant for a region that is in profound flux. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=148.8s)]
*  Aaron David Miller, welcome back to the show. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=154.24s)]
*  Great to be here with you, Isra. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  So we're speaking here on the morning of Tuesday, June 24th. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  Right now, just let's start with where your head is at. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=170.24s)]
*  What are you confident the bombings achieved? What are your big points of uncertainty right now? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  Give me your overview of the landscape. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=181.12s)]
*  Yeah, you know, first of all, I don't believe in game changers and flexion points, seed changes, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=183.68s)]
*  and transformation. Most of what happens in life is transactional, whether it's marriage, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=188.0s)]
*  diplomacy, business, and it certainly applies to the Middle East. Big changes have been afoot [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=192.24s)]
*  since October 7th, and I would argue there are some headlines and trend lines that have never [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=197.52s)]
*  existed before. The first is Israel's escalation dominance, which I think is the most important [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  thing that has happened. And everything that we're now talking about, Ezra, flows from the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=207.84s)]
*  notion that for the first time in its history, Israel controls the pace, the focus, the intensity [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=212.4s)]
*  of military conflict with its three key adversaries, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran. The Houthis provide [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=217.84s)]
*  somewhat of an exception because of the distance problem. But the reality is the Israelis can [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=224.8s)]
*  escalate in ways that these three adversaries cannot, and the Israelis can deter that escalation, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=230.0s)]
*  which I think is what we witnessed during the course of the last 12 days. So right now, I think [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=235.92s)]
*  you see a situation where a situational and transactional president, Donald Trump, who has [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=241.6s)]
*  no real effective strategy, no grand design with respect to what to me is this broken, angry, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=247.76s)]
*  and dysfunctional region where by and large American ideas on war making and peacemaking have gone to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=254.72s)]
*  die. But he has managed, as a consequence of Israel's escalation dominance, which he was wary [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=259.92s)]
*  about and has been for the last six months, to ride the tiger of Israel's owning the skies. As one [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=267.68s)]
*  Israeli retired general put it, we're playing soccer with the Iranians, but the only difference [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=275.92s)]
*  is they don't have a goalie. He's managed to ride the tiger of Israeli escalation dominance in Lebanon [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=281.36s)]
*  against Isabella and now in Iran. And I think he now fashions himself and sees a moment, a moment [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=288.88s)]
*  that arguably is historic. And he has expectations which probably go well beyond his capacity to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=297.84s)]
*  formulate an effective strategy in this region to turn that escalation dominance into what? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=307.76s)]
*  Transactional arrangements, understandings, political combinations, even peace treaties. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=315.28s)]
*  So I think we're on the cusp of something that has enormous potential. The real question is whether [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=321.28s)]
*  or not we have the leaders in Israel among the Palestinians in Iran and in Washington [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  that know how to use that moment. Unless there is leadership designed to implement something more [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=335.28s)]
*  coherent and cohesive and enduring, you and I probably are going to be having the same [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=342.8s)]
*  conversation next year at this time. What does Israel want and what does Iran want? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=347.68s)]
*  The Israeli calculation is a complicated one. Benjamin Netanyahu, I think high on the notion [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=353.12s)]
*  of what the Israeli military has achieved in Gaza at tremendous cost, to be sure, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=361.12s)]
*  among Palestinian civilians in Lebanon and in Iran, now sees a moment to emerge and to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=367.6s)]
*  essentially realize one of his two major foreign policy goals. And that is to free the people of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=374.64s)]
*  Israel, the state of Israel, from the shadow of an Iranian bomb. Aspirationally, I think he wants [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  to see a different regime in Tehran, but he'd probably settle making a virtue out of necessity [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=387.6s)]
*  of whatever damage the Israelis and Americans have managed to do to Iran's nuclear program. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=394.56s)]
*  And let's be clear, the only person I trust on this right now is Rafael Grossi, who's head of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=401.2s)]
*  the IAEA. And even he is- Can you say what that is? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=406.4s)]
*  Yeah, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Even Grossi is unsure about the degree of damage [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=410.72s)]
*  and destruction that the Israeli and American effort has done to the program. And if Grossi is [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=421.44s)]
*  unsure, and again, I trust him more than the president's assessment, we have totally [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=427.68s)]
*  obliterated Iran's nuclear program. I think that's wrong. I think Iran right now, Ezra, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=433.92s)]
*  is a nuclear weapons threshold state. That is to say, it has all of the elements that are required [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=440.88s)]
*  to assemble a nuclear weapon. And again, the kind of nuclear weapon that we dropped on Hiroshima [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=448.4s)]
*  and Nagasaki, not a sophisticated weapon that could be a miniaturized warhead, a physics package [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=454.4s)]
*  that could actually be on top of a missile, but dropped from a plane, whether it's six months, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=460.79999999999995s)]
*  eight months, a year, two years, I think Iran has the capacity. The question that everyone asks is, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  the Iranians have chosen so far to remain my image here, one screwdriver's turn away [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=473.52s)]
*  from producing such a weapon. And they're still not there. So Netanyahu would like a different regime. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=480.32s)]
*  I think he understands that's very difficult. Had this continued, maybe he could have gotten regime [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=486.96s)]
*  destabilization, dysfunction, not going to get regime change, it seems to me. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=494.08s)]
*  And let's be clear, the longest governing prime minister in the history of the state of Israel [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  on trial for bribery, fraud and trust in a Jerusalem district court five years running, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=503.92s)]
*  the most ruthless, politically savvy politician in Israel today sits astride Israeli politics [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=508.24s)]
*  and the US-Israeli relationship for now, like some sort of colossus. And it is extraordinary to me, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=515.12s)]
*  given the disasters of October 7, that there has been absolutely no accountability for this [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=523.76s)]
*  intelligence failure, no accountability for the fact that the prime minister in my judgment, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=530.64s)]
*  I'm an American here, I don't play in Israeli, despite some of my critics on TV or in the media, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=536.88s)]
*  this prime minister has managed to prioritize not any of the war of God in Israel, but the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=543.44s)]
*  right-wing coalition over whom he presides. He's prided, I think, and prioritized avenging the dead [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=549.84s)]
*  rather than redeeming the living. And the fate of those people gets sadder and more tragic and more [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=557.12s)]
*  fraught every single day that they remain in Gaza. So Netanyahu, I think, comes out of this for now [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=563.2s)]
*  extraordinarily, I think, as a prime minister, he's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=572.32s)]
*  extraordinarily powerful. An 86-year-old Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, made a judgment [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=579.6s)]
*  to respond in a way that's calibrated not to validate Iran's honor. It's too late for that. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  The Israelis have revealed its sheer vulnerabilities and weaknesses, but to preserve the regime. My [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=594.24s)]
*  friend Kareem Sajipour from Carnegie, my colleague, argues that even the most extreme revolutionaries [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=600.32s)]
*  the day after the revolution become conservatives because preserving and conserving the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=607.04s)]
*  revolution, and that is Ali Khamenei's objective, becomes, if you're a Star Trek fan, the prime [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=612.4s)]
*  directive. To what degree are we looking now at a new Middle East? You talked about Israel's an [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=619.28s)]
*  almost hegemonic military force. You have Iran, which has seen its proxies functionally devastated, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=625.28s)]
*  particularly Hezbollah, but also its own power revealed as much weaker than people thought, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=632.24s)]
*  say, five years ago. You have the Gulf states, which are in a very different place than they were [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=638.16s)]
*  10, 15 years ago. You think about where the Gulf states were in 2000. They are richer. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=643.6s)]
*  Their relationships with Israel and America are much, much stronger. They've modernized in many [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=648.64s)]
*  ways. It would have been unthinkable back then. When you think about the geopolitics of the Middle [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=653.52s)]
*  East that you worked on for much of your career and you look at how it looks now, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=659.44s)]
*  what makes it different and what possibilities and dangers are opened up by that? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=666.8000000000001s)]
*  The one continuity between the period of mid-'80s to 2003 when I left government, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=672.08s)]
*  one continuity, at least in terms of how you could produce a new Middle East, I don't believe in it [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=678.8000000000001s)]
*  because in so many respects, this is a broken, angry, and dysfunctional part of the world. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=686.96s)]
*  You have five Arab states, Libya, Yemen, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon in various phases of state [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=693.6800000000001s)]
*  dysfunction. You have extractive leaders and authoritarians just about everywhere. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=699.2s)]
*  Hopes of the Arab Spring in Tunisia and Egypt have been essentially overturned. The authoritarians [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=704.88s)]
*  reign just about everywhere. You've got gender inequality. You've got the key major terrorist [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=711.76s)]
*  groups still emanate in the CIA's rankings from this region. I would have argued and still do, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=719.68s)]
*  even though Iran has been hollowed out, the following. In the old days, Iraq, Syria, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=728.56s)]
*  and Egypt were the three prominent Arab states that vied for influence and power. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=735.28s)]
*  Right now, in my judgment, Iraq and Syria are basically offline. They cannot project their [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  power, although there may be some hope in Syria for a better ending to what happens when an [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=745.44s)]
*  authoritarian is thrown out of office. I'm keeping my expectations pretty low there. Egypt, which is [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=751.76s)]
*  burdened with many, many problems and no longer, despite its geographic centrality and the peace [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  treaty with Egypt, no longer is the central actor in US foreign policy. When I traveled with half a [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=765.6s)]
*  dozen secretaries of state, George Shultz, through Colin Powell, the first stop we always made was [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=772.72s)]
*  Cairo. Not the case anymore. It's the Gulf. This fracture, this dysfunction in the Arab world, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=778.88s)]
*  has led to two important changes. The one you referred to is the Gulf. It's stable, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=786.32s)]
*  authoritarian who can make decisions. It's rich. It's got hydrocarbons. The Emirates [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=793.36s)]
*  and the Saudis are vying to become the new entrepôs of the financial world. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=801.52s)]
*  That's one power scene that has emerged, but these are also very weak states with respect to [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=808.64s)]
*  geographic proximity to the Iranians. The other argument I would make is the rise of the three [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=814.64s)]
*  non-Arabs. Turkey, a member of NATO, Israel, America's closest ally, and Iran on their back [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  foot to be short, to say the least. But the three non-Arabs are still keepers. They're not going [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=831.52s)]
*  anywhere. The only three states in this region that can project their power abroad, they all have [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=837.9200000000001s)]
*  tremendous economic potential. They all have competent militaries and intelligence security [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=844.16s)]
*  organizations. They have and can have tremendous influence for good and for ill. Those are the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=850.96s)]
*  changes that I think are afoot. But again, converting what we've seen since October 7 [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=858.64s)]
*  and in the wake of the last 12 days into something that normal humans would regard as functional [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=866.96s)]
*  agreements, the end of conflict, governing empty spaces. When things change, if you want to talk [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=875.6s)]
*  about the new Middle East in any serious way, you really need to talk about leadership. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=883.2s)]
*  Leaders who are masters of their political houses, not prisoners of their ideologies [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=888.64s)]
*  or their politics. Leaders who are prepared to risk, but leaders who care about the security [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=892.88s)]
*  and prosperity of their publics rather than prioritizing keeping their seats. The reality is, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=899.52s)]
*  when I look around in this region, I don't see that kind of leadership, which is why converting [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=906.56s)]
*  escalation dominance into lasting political arrangements, let alone peace treaties, cannot [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=913.12s)]
*  be done without leaders. In Israel, we do not have one. Among the Palestinians, that is so fraught. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=919.92s)]
*  The Palestinians are faced with an unpalatable choice between Ma'ap on one hand and Hamas on [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=927.44s)]
*  the other. They won't get to choose because the notion of elections or a coherent Palestinian [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=933.2800000000001s)]
*  governing authority right now basically is a thought experiment. There's a great dysfunction [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=940.1600000000001s)]
*  here, which isn't going away. Your colleague, Steven Wertheimer, made an argument I thought [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=947.36s)]
*  was interesting. He wrote that Israel acted less to preempt an Iranian bomb than to preempt American [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=953.12s)]
*  diplomacy. A new nuclear deal would have lifted sanctions on Iran's battered economy, helped it [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=959.44s)]
*  to recover and grow. A deal would have stabilized Iran's position in the Middle East and potentially [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=964.32s)]
*  strengthened it over time. Precisely by succeeding in preventing Iran from going nuclear, a deal [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=969.12s)]
*  would have advanced Iran's integration into the region. In this telling, Netanyahu's real aim here [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=974.5600000000001s)]
*  is keeping Iran isolated and weak. Do you buy that? I buy the final comment, and I like and admire [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=981.12s)]
*  Steven. I don't buy the argument because I've been around negotiations for a very long time. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=991.68s)]
*  I understand what is required. Mostly, we failed at the negotiations that I was a part of, with the [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=999.52s)]
*  exception of four extraordinary years under Bush 41 and James Baker. The last time, I might add, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1004.96s)]
*  we were admired, feared, and respected as a great power. I've not been involved during the [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1010.8s)]
*  Obama and Biden administrations in Iranian U.S. negotiations. But the reality is you want to make [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1017.04s)]
*  a negotiation work, you need four things. You need two parties who are willing and are able. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1022.4799999999999s)]
*  You need a sense of urgency. You need a mediator who's prepared at the right times to apply ample [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1027.68s)]
*  amounts of vinegar and ample amounts of honey. And you need a balance, a negotiation, and an end [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1034.64s)]
*  game of the negotiation based on a balance of interests. The last five rounds of Trump [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1042.5600000000002s)]
*  administration negotiations, mediated primarily by Steven Witkoff, the envoy for everything, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1049.76s)]
*  in my judgment, given what was on the table, never had a chance of succeeding. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1058.0800000000002s)]
*  The ultimate bridge between Iran's demand, obsession, determination against every conceivable [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1062.8s)]
*  force and odds to maintain its right to enrich and actually to enrich fundamentally came in conflict [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1071.12s)]
*  with the Trump administration's notion that no, Iran will have zero enrichment [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1080.0s)]
*  capacity. And forget the right, the capacity, the actual reality of enriching on Iranian soil. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1087.8400000000001s)]
*  They never figured out how to bridge that gap. And you can't do this in six rounds of negotiations [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1094.88s)]
*  separated by a week and a half. You needed more time, a more serious effort, and a willingness [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1104.64s)]
*  on each side to be more flexible. And since there's no trust, no confidence, since the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1111.6s)]
*  prime directive for the Iranians is he pulled out of the last agreement, how are we going to ensure [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1119.52s)]
*  that he won't pull out of this one problem? The Iranians' view of negotiating with Americans [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1127.6s)]
*  was, I think, traumatized by the withdrawal. So you had a lot of odds stacked against you. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1133.76s)]
*  And yes, there's no question that that negotiation impasse afforded both Netanyahu and the President, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1147.36s)]
*  Trump, an opportunity to essentially deal with the problem in a different way. But I do not [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1155.1999999999998s)]
*  subscribe to the narrative that a clever, crafty Israeli prime minister willfully sandbagged a [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1163.76s)]
*  naive president into abandoning negotiations which were somehow on the cusp of a major breakthrough. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1172.32s)]
*  Trump played an active role in the fiction and the roots that the Israelis required [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1179.92s)]
*  to implement the first phase of their military campaign, which was the decapitation strategy. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1187.52s)]
*  Trump's insistence right up until June 12th, the night of June 12th slash 13th, when the Israeli [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1194.24s)]
*  strikes began, was that there would be a sixth round in Oman. And I think the Iranians were [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1202.88s)]
*  lulled into believing that there would be no Israeli strike until after those negotiations [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1210.64s)]
*  concluded and the President made a judgment that they had succeeded or failed. So no, Trump rode [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1215.68s)]
*  Netanyahu's tiger once he saw precisely how much damage, how much skill, how much operational [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1222.88s)]
*  capacity the Israelis had. Fried Zakaria described it as FOMO, that that's what essentially [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1231.92s)]
*  motivated Trump, fear of missing out. He wanted some of that. I do believe- [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1239.28s)]
*  Wait, I think you're saying two things that feel like they're intention to me. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1244.96s)]
*  One is that Trump was an active strategic participant creating a ruse to allow Israel to [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1248.24s)]
*  execute an attack, right? It was not long ago that we saw Trump with Netanyahu saying, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1255.44s)]
*  you have to wait. I'm negotiating. I do not want you bombing around, right? That happened in public. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1261.92s)]
*  It looked like a public rebuke of Netanyahu. So one version, which you've sometimes heard from [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1266.72s)]
*  the Trump White House, I feel like I'm hearing it from you right now, is this was all a ruse. And [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1270.96s)]
*  Trump was strategically operating alongside Netanyahu to lull the Iranians into a false sense of [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1275.8400000000001s)]
*  complacency. The other interpretation is that Israel acted without the US's full blessing, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1281.8400000000001s)]
*  certainly without our full cooperation, began the bombing. And then Trump, in some reports, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1290.32s)]
*  watching Fox News, seeing how much the Israelis were succeeding the objective, decided to jump in [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1296.32s)]
*  and be part of it. Those are two, I think, quite different interpretations of what Trump was doing. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1302.56s)]
*  Either which do you subscribe to, or how do you synthesize them? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1308.48s)]
*  Well, timing is a critically important piece here. For the last two months, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1310.96s)]
*  Trump did warn Netanyahu off. I think the Monday before the Thursday that the Israelis struck, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1314.96s)]
*  I think he was quite uncertain about whether or not this was a good idea. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1320.24s)]
*  But let's be clear. Donald Trump, in the last two months, has done things to Israel and without [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1327.2s)]
*  Israel's coordination and consent that no other American president that I ever worked for, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1334.8s)]
*  Republican or Democrat, has done. He has essentially undermined two of the three [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1340.64s)]
*  political laws of gravity that have governed the US-Israeli relationship. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1346.96s)]
*  Number one is the no daylight policy. We must coordinate everything with Israel. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1352.08s)]
*  Donald Trump sanctioned his own hostage negotiator in March to open up direct negotiations, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1357.44s)]
*  three rounds, with Hamas, the external leadership, over and above Israeli objections or without [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1365.6000000000001s)]
*  Israeli even acquiescence. He cut a deal with the Houthis without Israel's knowledge, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1372.16s)]
*  which essentially implied that as long as the Houthis restrained from attacking US naval assets [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1378.72s)]
*  and US flagged or owned commercial shipping, they could basically continue their campaign to launch [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1384.64s)]
*  drones and ballistic missiles at Israel. And he announced in the presence of an Israeli prime [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1391.6000000000001s)]
*  minister, probably over his objections, that he was initiating in April a negotiation. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1396.56s)]
*  And then finally, over Netanyahu's objections, he lifted, quite to the Israeli surprises and [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1404.08s)]
*  most of the surprise of Washington, sanctions, lifted sanctions on the regime of Ahmad Sharah [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1409.44s)]
*  in Syria so that no daylight policy, he blew through. The second law of gravity, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1417.6s)]
*  which was attention to domestic political constraints. If a Democratic president [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1424.4s)]
*  had done any of the things I've just identified, let alone all of them, it would probably be a move [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1430.96s)]
*  on the part of Republicans to impeach him. So Donald Trump, in my judgment, had the personality, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1437.3600000000001s)]
*  had the will to say at least to the Israeli prime minister, look, I understand what you want to do. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1445.8400000000001s)]
*  You've got a compelling case, but you need to give me more time. You need to give me another [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1453.68s)]
*  two months. But Trump basically handicapped his own argument by setting this completely unrealistic [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1461.76s)]
*  deadline of two months. This was two months to negotiate with Iran. Exactly. And the truth is, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1470.0s)]
*  we saw it play out in the last 12 hours. He compelled the Israelis to tone down their [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1476.72s)]
*  response to the deaths to ballistic missiles in Be'er Sheva that caused the deaths of three, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1484.5600000000002s)]
*  four, five Israelis. So no, I don't buy, but in large part, what I'm saying to you, I think is [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1491.2s)]
*  that Donald Trump is transactionally situational. He doesn't have a strategy. There's no core. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1501.12s)]
*  Biden could not bring himself for over a year to impose a single cost or consequence on Israel [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1509.04s)]
*  that normal humans would regard as serious or sustained pressure. He could have restricted or [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1518.4799999999998s)]
*  conditioned US military to Israel. He didn't do that. He could have introduced the UN Security [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1524.08s)]
*  Council resolution or voted for someone else's. He didn't do that. He could have unilaterally [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1529.12s)]
*  recognized Palestinian state. He didn't do that. He could have marshaled a rhetorical campaign [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1534.0s)]
*  day in and day out, basically questioning the fact that Israel is not a reliable. He didn't do that. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1541.1999999999998s)]
*  Biden had a core. I'm just reporting here, so don't shoot me. Biden had a core, and the core [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1548.4799999999998s)]
*  was a deep and abiding emotional and political commitment to the security of Israel, the people [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1555.2s)]
*  of Israel, the idea of Israel. That was Joe Biden in the Senate for decades. That was Joe Biden's [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1561.8400000000001s)]
*  father telling him that silence in the face of evil, the Holocaust, is complicity. That's Joe [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1567.52s)]
*  Biden who was a part of Israel's story and felt himself to be a part of it. That's not Donald [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1575.76s)]
*  Trump. Donald Trump is a transactor, and if you get in the middle between him and something he [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1580.56s)]
*  really wants, this is a president who in six months has sidelined Israel, has pressured Israel, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1587.36s)]
*  and has supported Israel. Let me interrupt this for one second, because I think the thing, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1595.6799999999998s)]
*  if you've been watching this, you will think hearing this is, yes, there are things Donald [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1602.32s)]
*  Trump wanted for America. He wanted to negotiate the return of a hostage. He wanted our shipping [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1608.08s)]
*  to not be endangered by the Houthis, but Donald Trump has put no serious curbs on what Israel is [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1613.9199999999998s)]
*  doing in Gaza or the West Bank, to be very clear, and he just gave Israel the thing [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1622.0s)]
*  that all these other presidents, including Joe Biden for all of his deep-seated Zionism, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1628.48s)]
*  did not give Israel, which is American participation using our most powerful, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1632.72s)]
*  depth-penetrating munitions in a bombing campaign to destroy as much of Iran's nuclear program as [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1638.8s)]
*  we could. So for all the, you know, Trump does not follow protocol in the way other presidents do. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1647.68s)]
*  He is much freer with his language than other presidents have been. But if you ask who gave [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1654.88s)]
*  Israel what they really wanted, the thing Netanyahu could not get from George W. Bush, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1660.88s)]
*  from Barack Obama, from Donald Trump number one, from Joe Biden, it was this. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1665.3600000000001s)]
*  That's my point, though. He removed sanctions on settlers. He restored the shipment of 2,000-pound [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1670.0800000000002s)]
*  bombs. He basically has given Israel a free hand in the West Bank. No, no, I'm not here to argue [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1676.72s)]
*  that Donald Trump is somehow only interested, that he's the new Eisenhower, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1684.56s)]
*  that basically he's the only American president ever to threaten serious and sustained pressure [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1692.08s)]
*  against the state of Israel, as Eisenhower did in the wake of Suez, the only one, no American [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1699.52s)]
*  president has gone beyond what Eisenhower was prepared to do. My sense was Donald Trump has no [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1704.1599999999999s)]
*  core, which is why he is the ultimate transactor, that he could do both and not blink an eye, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1710.08s)]
*  that he could basically call up an Israeli prime minister and say, don't overreact. I don't want [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1719.4399999999998s)]
*  you, I don't know what the Israelis were prepared to do, but I guarantee you it would have been as [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1725.84s)]
*  devastating a strike in response to the deaths of five Israelis, which were the fifth of all the [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1730.48s)]
*  Israelis who were killed over the course of the last 12 days by Iranian ballistic missiles. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1736.48s)]
*  It is the absence of a core. It is Trump's response to situations. It's the absence of an [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1742.16s)]
*  effective strategy. And I would have bet you that had the Israelis not struck June 12, 13, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1751.2s)]
*  he would have tried to find a deal with the Iranians that would have parked the nuclear issue, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1758.56s)]
*  parked it, a transactional deal, not a transformational one, parked the Iranian issue [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1763.68s)]
*  until the end of his, hopefully his final term in office. So I understand exactly what you're [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1770.96s)]
*  saying. And I'm not here to whitewash Donald Trump as someone who is a standup guy when it comes to [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1780.16s)]
*  Israel. That's exactly the opposite point I'm making. Well, the thing I'm trying to get at here [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1787.6000000000001s)]
*  is because I'm also, I don't think you're trying to whitewash Donald Trump. That's not my view, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1793.36s)]
*  is that there is a question of whether or not Donald Trump is trying to achieve something here. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1798.72s)]
*  Right. He's been working with Netanyahu hand in glove, and maybe it's that he wanted to set back [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1805.68s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear program, right? You could see Donald Trump is acting here with a goal. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1810.56s)]
*  And you could see Donald Trump here as making decisions day by day, by day, by day, without [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1814.8s)]
*  really a theory of how they're all going to work out. And I think what is worth thinking about, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1820.72s)]
*  a thing I have been trying to think about, is Trump just gave Israel something that [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1825.44s)]
*  every other recent president, including Donald Trump, thought was too risky to give them. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1831.2s)]
*  And is that because bombing Iran, given Iran's current state, is no longer that large of a risk [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1837.04s)]
*  because they cannot project power as they once could, because Israel's decapitated so many of [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1843.52s)]
*  their proxies? Is that because Donald Trump has a higher risk tolerance or wants something [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1847.84s)]
*  different or wants something more than the other presidents did or than he did during his first [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1854.0s)]
*  term? Right. We have just seen a massive change in US policy towards Iran. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1858.32s)]
*  Well, we went to, yeah, we went to over there on. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1864.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes. What is that change in service of? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1866.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, and how do we know if it will have worked? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1869.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, so it doesn't that offer? Well, that's a separate analytical question. The first one is [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1871.9199999999998s)]
*  theoretical. I think Trump saw an opportunity and he took it. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1876.56s)]
*  Was Trump right to take the opportunity? Well, that's another question as to whether or not [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1881.84s)]
*  what we have done ultimately will redound to an advancement of American national interest [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1887.84s)]
*  or retardation of those interests. What is our interest? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1894.32s)]
*  We have, well, I would reduce our interest in the Middle East without being sentimental. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1898.32s)]
*  Our vital interests, that is vital regarding a situation where American presidents would [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1903.5200000000002s)]
*  risk putting Americans in harm's way. We have three interests in the Middle East. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1910.8000000000002s)]
*  Number one, counterterrorism. Number two, maintaining access to hydrocarbons. And number [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1915.1200000000001s)]
*  three, ensuring that there is no regional hegemon with a nuclear weapon. That's not to say we don't [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1920.0s)]
*  have an array of other interests. I worked on one of those interests for my entire career, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1926.5600000000002s)]
*  but it was never deemed to be a vital national interest, which is one of the reasons I think [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1932.24s)]
*  that in so many administrations, it was never a serious effort to look at the Israeli-Palestinian, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1938.08s)]
*  Arab-Israeli issue as a national interest, particularly at the end of the Cold War. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1944.08s)]
*  It was viewed as a discretionary problem. It would be nice to have. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1949.04s)]
*  You say one of our vital interests is preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1953.2s)]
*  probably in this case, Iran, with a nuclear weapon. First, why is that our vital interest? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1957.84s)]
*  It seems obvious, but I think it's worth spelling it out because as much as Trump did diverge from [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1964.24s)]
*  other presidents here, not allowing Iran to develop a nuclear weapon has been a very, very [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1968.8s)]
*  consistent view of every recent American president. And secondly, you say there can be no regional [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1974.0s)]
*  hegemon with a nuclear weapon. Militarily, isn't Israel a regional hegemon with nuclear weapons? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1979.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I use the term escalation dominance. They probably shouldn't have used the term [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1986.4s)]
*  regional hegemon. Israel is not a regional hegemon the way the former Soviet Union was in Eastern [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1990.24s)]
*  Europe. But Iran wasn't going to get there either with a weapon. Right. But Iran would emerge. My [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=1994.64s)]
*  definition is Iran emerges in a competitive and antagonistic way as a threat to Saudi Arabia, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2000.3200000000002s)]
*  as a threat to Israel's readiness ideology. An expansionary power with [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2012.24s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. Yeah, that'd be a better way to frame it. Right. Yeah. An expansionary power [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2016.32s)]
*  with a nuclear weapon. Right. Because that threatens our core interests. I mean, Iran [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2022.24s)]
*  clearly has an ideology which seeks to influence and convert the so-called Shia Axis, Baghdad, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2028.6399999999999s)]
*  Beirut, Sana'a with the Houthis, Damascus. That seems to stretch these days in large part, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2037.92s)]
*  given Russian retrenchment, given Ahmad Shahra's rise. You're not talking basically about [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2049.52s)]
*  a Sunni regime in Syria. I don't see, and you now have the hollowing out of Iran's ability to [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2056.56s)]
*  protect its power abroad. So I don't think that is as critical an interest. But Iran's pursuit of [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2064.48s)]
*  the weapon and Iran, 90 million people, Iran's a keeper. It's been a keeper for centuries. It's a [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2072.2400000000002s)]
*  real country. Is Israel an expansionary power with a nuclear weapon? Israel has a new definition of [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2080.16s)]
*  border security, which I find to be very intriguing. I mean, and it goes beyond their security doctrine. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2086.88s)]
*  They will preempt or prevent. But if you look at what the Israelis have done, in Gaza, they are [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2095.04s)]
*  there for an indefinite period of time. In the West Bank, they are now more entrenched than they've [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2100.16s)]
*  ever been since the second Intifada. In Lebanon, they still have not withdrawn from the five [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2104.96s)]
*  strategic points obligated to withdraw. And the Trump administration has acquiesced in that. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2110.08s)]
*  And in Syria, they've declared much of the area southwest of Damascus as an Ogo zone. It's a [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2116.0s)]
*  fascinating sort of anticipatory hedge against October 7, and partly also because it does advance [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2122.56s)]
*  Israel's operational and offensive capacities. So an ongoing Israeli-Iranian conflict is basically [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2135.2s)]
*  going to endure, even if the Iranians don't make a major effort to try to reconstitute the program, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2144.32s)]
*  or worse, push for an actual weapon. And as somebody with long experience in the region who [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2153.44s)]
*  has thought deeply about these questions, do you think it served America's national interest [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2160.8s)]
*  to drop Bunker Buster bombs in Iran? Given the fact that we don't know [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2167.04s)]
*  what the damage was, given the fact that we don't know what the end state is, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2173.68s)]
*  it's a highly arguable proposition. At the same time, given the result, again, it's in my case, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2179.04s)]
*  and I want to be honest here, I would hope I want to be honest, it reminds me of the guy who jumps [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2189.3599999999997s)]
*  off the 10-story building, and as he's passing the fifth floor, somebody yells out, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2195.92s)]
*  how are you doing? And he responds, so far, so good. I think the case, I think it was a judgment [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2200.32s)]
*  call, and it was not, in my judgment, a slam dunk judgment call. I think that on, I guess if I were [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2207.36s)]
*  running the railroad, I would have asked for two more months to determine whether or not Iran was [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2218.64s)]
*  serious about this negotiation. I would have probably varied what I would put on the table [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2228.4s)]
*  in an effort to get the Iranians to agree. It wouldn't have been anything like the JCPOA. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2237.7599999999998s)]
*  And then- [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2243.84s)]
*  Which was the Obama era nuclear deal with Iran that Trump ripped up. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2245.0400000000004s)]
*  Right. If the Iranians were not interested, I think I would have agreed with the decision. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2248.6400000000003s)]
*  So there's an argument you've heard made recently from a number of Democrats that, look, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2256.1600000000003s)]
*  Obama signed this deal with Iran, that a lot of other countries were counterparties in this deal [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2259.84s)]
*  in some way or another. We had inspectors there, there was a framework, there was a structure. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2266.4s)]
*  Trump ripped it up and then was trying to make a new deal that sounded kind of like the JCPOA [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2270.48s)]
*  and then ended up bombing during the deal making process, which probably makes it very hard to [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2277.76s)]
*  imagine that you will ever convince Iran back to the table in the future. So first, do you buy the [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2283.84s)]
*  argument that the deal we had was sort of fine and the problem was just Trump ripping it up and [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2290.16s)]
*  causing a problem that he now needed to solve? And two, since you said if you were running [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2296.4s)]
*  negotiations, you would create something very different, what would have been different about [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2300.88s)]
*  it? Well, first of all, the JCPOA was flawed but functional. It restrained it constrained it, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2304.48s)]
*  it created a degree of intrusive inspections that I think frankly were working. It doesn't [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2310.64s)]
*  mean that the Iranians weren't cheating. Of course they were cheating. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2316.64s)]
*  Um, preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon in my judgment never had a good answer. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2320.0s)]
*  This is not the best answer either and leads into the analytical question of how do you permanently [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2327.28s)]
*  ensure that Iran can never acquire a nuclear weapon? There's only one way to do it and it's [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2335.84s)]
*  tethered to a galaxy far, far away rather than the realities back here on planet Earth. And that is [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2341.36s)]
*  to fundamentally change the regime and create one or the Iranian public will create one that [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2347.12s)]
*  is not interested in acquiring a nuclear weapon. I might add the Shah was well on his way and wanted [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2355.92s)]
*  one as well. Iran has a profound sense of entitlement and insecurity. That is a very bad [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2361.04s)]
*  combination in any nation. Profound entitlement and profound insecurity. And I think that the [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2370.56s)]
*  Iranian program is not dead. It hasn't been totally obliterated. The 800 pounds of highly [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2379.2799999999997s)]
*  enriched uranium fissile material went missing. Where is it? How many centrifuges, advanced [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2386.16s)]
*  centrifuges survived? Iran is I think over time, even though it'll be very difficult given Israel's [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2392.56s)]
*  command of the airspace. But if they don't deal with the IAEA any longer or they withdraw from [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2400.0s)]
*  the NPT, the Non-Proliferation Treaty, you can see that this operation, which is now being touted as [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2406.56s)]
*  an unqualified success, I certainly wouldn't call it that, is going to be looked at quite differently. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2416.32s)]
*  Which is why in the end, Ezra, we come back to the same, in my judge we talk about the New Middle East, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2424.72s)]
*  we come back to the same two unanswered questions. How do you translate this escalation dominance [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2431.44s)]
*  into something more enduring that reflects a better balance of interest? And number two, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2441.2s)]
*  do you have the leaders to convert that? Benjamin Netanyahu is not interested. He's already [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2447.44s)]
*  demolished Israel's enemies. Now he seeks to become the peacemaker. I don't see it because it [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2459.76s)]
*  assaults at least one of the core principles, which is there is not going to be a Palestinian state and [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2464.88s)]
*  there will be no division of East Jerusalem and there will be no major Israeli concessions [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2471.84s)]
*  with territorial concessions on the West Bank. I don't see it among the Palestinians. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2476.4s)]
*  The Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, every Iranian expert I talk to tells me that if there is [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2482.3199999999997s)]
*  regime change, it's likely to be particularly in this environment. It's going to be an IRGC, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2489.92s)]
*  heavily military securitized regime and figure that the only borrowing a page out of Gaddafi's book, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2496.24s)]
*  the one Gaddafi didn't read, but one that Kim Jong-un did read, basically you need a nuclear [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2503.9199999999996s)]
*  weapon to guard against, hedge against regime change. I don't see the leadership. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2510.56s)]
*  Peter T. Leeson I want to say from my perspective, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2516.8799999999997s)]
*  I just claim no knowledge of how any of this will turn out. I've actually felt even in preparing [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2519.7599999999998s)]
*  for this conversation, it's hard to find anything that feels like strong commentary to me because [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2529.2s)]
*  everybody's just speculating. Peter T. Leeson [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2533.6s)]
*  Ezra, I mean, Ezra Klein, you're a very wise man. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2535.3599999999997s)]
*  Ezra Klein Thank you. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2538.56s)]
*  Peter T. Leeson It's, and one of the lessons I've learned [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2539.04s)]
*  after decades of failure in negotiations, you really need to respect, not admire, not countenance, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2543.04s)]
*  but respect the degree of difficulty that the issues and the leaders in this part of the world [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2552.4s)]
*  pose. It is more often than not a place where American ideas on war making and peacemaking [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2560.32s)]
*  go to die. No one that I know, and I'll put myself at the top of the list, is prepared to make [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2567.6s)]
*  predictions, hard and fast predictions. The Israelis now believe that what's happened to Iran is going [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2573.12s)]
*  to open the door to a dramatic expansion of the Abraham Accords. I don't know exactly what Middle [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2581.68s)]
*  East they're looking at. Peter T. Leeson [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2590.48s)]
*  One version of what just happened, there's a sort of precedent in Israel bombing the Iraqi nuclear [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2592.72s)]
*  program back in the 80s, is this sets things back quite a bit, and it just kind of defers it and [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2599.68s)]
*  people are able to keep it contained and keep it in a box. There is a tension there. I mean, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2606.32s)]
*  you've spoken to the Israelis about the Iranians much more than I have, but I've spoken to them [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2611.6000000000004s)]
*  enough about the Iranians that the completely universal opinion within the Israeli security [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2615.92s)]
*  class is that America does not understand Iran. Iran is a patient strategic power with an imperialistic [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2622.7200000000003s)]
*  past and deeply ideological hegemonic ambitions, and they will wait and they will strategize [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2629.28s)]
*  and they will act on a longer timeframe than America ever acts upon. It seems to me that if [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2636.5600000000004s)]
*  you believe that, then a bombing campaign that, depending on who you believe, set Iran back [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2643.52s)]
*  six months, two years, but at the same time made it almost impossible for the Iranians to ever [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2653.1200000000003s)]
*  trust diplomacy with us again, you sort of knocked out the idea of a deal. And so what? You're left [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2659.84s)]
*  with either regime change or the expectation that the thing Iran is not going to do is wait [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2667.52s)]
*  one screwdriver turn away, that when the new hardliners come in or when there's quiet or [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2673.6000000000004s)]
*  America is distracted by something else, they're going to spread to a bomb. And that what they'll [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2680.56s)]
*  do is what Pakistan did, what North Korea did, which is like emerge one day and say, we've got [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2686.08s)]
*  one now. And so now you can't attack us. Now, maybe that doesn't happen, but that seems very [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2689.52s)]
*  plausible from where we sit because making diplomacy into a ruse seems like it has at [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2696.7200000000003s)]
*  least one very obvious problem, which is if you ever need diplomacy in the future, how do you [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2702.56s)]
*  persuade your counterparty? It's not again a ruse. Well, ever is a very long time. Declaring the end [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2707.84s)]
*  of anything is a hard proposition because the truth is neither you nor I can see what's in [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2715.44s)]
*  front of us. I was in Israel on October 6th, 1973, right? Until now, the greatest intelligence [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2721.52s)]
*  failure in the history of the state of Israel. And within six years, I watched Sadat, Begin, and Carter [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2727.2000000000003s)]
*  sign a full treaty of peace on the White House lawn. September 13th, 1993, and in that case, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2733.6s)]
*  trauma for the Israelis turned to hope. I sat on the White House lawn on October, September 13th, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2739.92s)]
*  1993, watching Rabin Arfand Clinton sign the Oslo Declaration of Principles. And yet everything [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2746.7200000000003s)]
*  on that day now lies somewhere, broken, bloodied, and battered. In that case, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2755.36s)]
*  hope turned to trauma. So what do you conclude from this? Well, you conclude that we occupy a [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2763.12s)]
*  tiny space on the planet for a very short period of time. You can say, you never say never. That is [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2770.7200000000003s)]
*  a very strong proposition in my worldview. I have two kids and four grandkids. I'm not going to [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2776.96s)]
*  mortgage their futures by saying the American Republic is doomed to failure or Israelis and [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2784.32s)]
*  Palestinians cannot find a way forward. I don't have the right, the moral right to do that. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2790.48s)]
*  So in answer to your question, I've been around the Middle East to know it doesn't offer up very [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2796.6400000000003s)]
*  often transformative, happy, or Hollywood endings to everything. So when people talk about a new [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2803.28s)]
*  at least I shake my head, but I listen. I listen a lot more now. I have a lot more uncertainty and a [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2812.0s)]
*  lot more humility. But this is one complicated region. And we are like very often a modern day [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2820.48s)]
*  Gulliver wandering around in a part of the world that we don't understand, tied up by tiny powers, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2830.16s)]
*  some large, some small, whose interests are not our own. And more than that, as reburdened, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2838.32s)]
*  in essence, by our own illusions. Donald Trump, unlike any American president that I ever worked [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2846.48s)]
*  for, doesn't look, let's be very clear, doesn't look at Israel the way any other American president [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2854.7200000000003s)]
*  looked at Israel. I don't think he has this emotional, sentimental view of the Israeli story. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2864.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't think he's that attached to the idea of Israel as Biden was, the identity, the security, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2873.1200000000003s)]
*  the people of Israel. Because I don't think Donald Trump is attached to much beyond his own [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2881.6s)]
*  immediate circumstances. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2888.6400000000003s)]
*  I think that is the place to end. What are the three books you'd recommend to the audience? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2891.12s)]
*  I actually prepared for this. I have two books. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2895.8399999999997s)]
*  The rest of you are just winging. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2899.92s)]
*  Two books on how to do successful Middle East diplomacy. Since that's kind of what we're [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2902.72s)]
*  talking about. Martin Indig's Master of the Game, Henry Kissinger in the Art of Middle East Diplomacy, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2908.24s)]
*  and Peter Baker and Sudden Glasser's Masterful, The Man Who Ran Washington, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2914.1600000000003s)]
*  A Life of Times of James Baker. Those are the two books I would recommend. There are real lessons [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2919.36s)]
*  there about how to do successful diplomacy. I have a third book, one that isn't out yet, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2924.56s)]
*  that argues that the US, including many who worked on this process for a very long time, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2931.44s)]
*  has gotten it profoundly and utterly wrong when it comes to peacemaking. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2938.1600000000003s)]
*  It's called Tomorrow is Yesterday, Life, Death, and the Pursuit of Peace in Israel, Palestine, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOgE0siWBto&t=2944.88s)]
