# What Is the Democratic Party For?
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [June 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mylX_uMaX8k)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  I've been thinking about this moment on Thursday night, after the first presidential debate,
*  when MSNBC's Alex Wagner interviewed Governor Gavin Newsom of California.
*  You were out there getting a chorus of questions about whether Biden should step down.
*  There is panic that is set in.
*  Well, there is panic that is set in among people who have watched this debate, who are
*  Democrats, people who are strategists, and some even inside Democratic campaigns.
*  Do you think it's unfounded?
*  Well, I think it's unhelpful.
*  And I think it's unnecessary.
*  We've got to go in and got to keep our heads high.
*  And as they say, we've got to have the back of this president.
*  You don't turn your back because of one performance.
*  What kind of party does that?
*  What kind of party would do that?
*  Well, maybe a party that wanted to win, a party that wanted to nominate a candidate
*  that the American people believe is up to doing the most important, most difficult job
*  in the world.
*  Maybe the better question is, what kind of party right now would do nothing?
*  In February, I argued that Joe Biden should step aside, that he shouldn't run for reelection,
*  that Democrats should do what political parties did in presidential elections until the 1970s,
*  choose a ticket at their convention.
*  In public, the backlash I got from top Democrats was ferocious.
*  I was a bedwetter living inside an errands, sorkin drenched fantasy land.
*  In private, their feedback was more tentative and thoughtful and frightened.
*  No one tried to persuade me that Biden was a strong candidate.
*  They argued instead that he couldn't be convinced to step aside.
*  That even if he could be, that Vice President Kamala Harris would lose the election.
*  That even if a convention passed over Harris, that passing her over would alienate black
*  women.
*  They argued not that Joe Biden was strong, but that the Democratic Party was weak.
*  That it had no other options.
*  That it didn't have the legitimacy or the muscle to do something else.
*  I don't believe that.
*  I think Democrats should give themselves a little bit more credit.
*  Biden's presidency is proof of the Democratic Party's ability to act strategically.
*  Biden didn't win the Democratic nomination in 2020 because he set the hearts of party
*  activists aflame.
*  Support for Biden always lacked the passion of support for Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth
*  Warren or even Andrew Yang.
*  Biden won because the party made a cold decision to unite around the candidate it thought best
*  suited to beating Donald Trump.
*  Biden won because Democrats did what they had to do, not what they wanted to do.
*  And it wasn't just Biden.
*  While the Republican Party was collapsing fully into its MAGA era, repeatedly choosing
*  these wannabe Trumps who lose winnable elections, Democrats have kept choosing candidates who
*  win tough races in challenging states, candidates suited to the races they need to run.
*  Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan, Tony Evers in Wisconsin, Josh Shapiro and John Federman in
*  Pennsylvania, Mark Kelly and Katie Hobbs in Arizona, John Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in
*  Georgia.
*  Since 2018, Democrats have been on a winning streak and they've been on that streak because
*  they have acted strategically or Republicans have acted impulsively.
*  And yet these same Democrats, they have no confidence they could rise to the moment if
*  Biden steps aside.
*  I'd sometimes ask them what they thought would happen if, God forbid, in a terrible turn
*  of events, Biden received health news that forced him to end his campaign.
*  Would the Democratic Party collapse into the fetal position and accept Trump's ascension?
*  No, of course not, they said.
*  Democrats then would have no choice.
*  They'd have to build a ticket at the convention.
*  I always found that answer revealing.
*  There's no lack of talent or capacity in the Democratic Party.
*  There's a lack of coherence and confidence.
*  What is this party for?
*  Newsom's comments on Thursday implied an answer.
*  The party's function is to support Joe Biden.
*  We've got to have his back, he said.
*  He said the criticism of Joe Biden, it was not unfounded, just unhelpful.
*  The more astonishing statement came from Tim Waltz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota,
*  who talked to Fox News.
*  I think we could learn something from Republicans.
*  Republicans will not abandon Donald Trump through indictments, through whatever it may
*  be.
*  Is that a model Democrats should really want to follow?
*  How have Republicans done since embracing Donald Trump?
*  Republicans lost in 2018, they lost in 2020, they underperformed badly in 2022.
*  And rather than changing course, they've doubled down.
*  In March, Laura Trump was elected co-chair of the Republican National Committee.
*  She is, from any traditional party perspective, completely unqualified for the job.
*  But if you view the RNC as a vehicle for simply the ambitions and whims of Donald Trump, her
*  father-in-law, then she is completely qualified.
*  She is loyal to nothing and no one in the party save Trump.
*  She is crystal clear on the role the RNC should play.
*  Every single penny will go to the number one and the only job of the RNC.
*  That is electing Donald J. Trump as president of the United States and saving this country.
*  We have no time to waste.
*  So look, I think this has been a disaster for Republicans.
*  I think the only reason they might lose in 2024 is they nominated Trump again.
*  They nominated Nikki Haley.
*  I don't think there'd be anything Democrats could do right now.
*  But this goes beyond any one election.
*  This is a corruption of the very concept of a political party.
*  In the great book, The Hollow Parties, Sam Rosenfeld and Danish Lausman tell the history
*  of how the strong parties of yesterday became the hollowed out vehicles for individual presidential
*  ambition we see today.
*  The ethos of the early American political parties was that they were a bulwark against
*  politics becoming about one person at a time when Americans feared a return to that.
*  The idea, Rosenfeld told me, was, quote, that parties subsume individual ambition.
*  You commit to the party and to the cause, never to the man.
*  Did parties live up to this perfectly always?
*  No, of course not.
*  But they did live up to it imperfectly.
*  They did live up to it at key moments.
*  Famously, it was a delegation of Republican members of Congress who persuaded President
*  Richard Nixon to resign.
*  There is more to the Republican Party than Richard Nixon's ambitions.
*  There is not more to the Republican Party today than Donald Trump's ambitions.
*  But I would have told you the Democratic Party is different.
*  That it is not just a vehicle for Joe Biden's ambitions.
*  Right now, I'm not so sure.
*  The best case against replacing Biden, is it doing so at this late hour, is riskier
*  than keeping him.
*  But that is a choice the Democratic Party made and has kept making.
*  It was a choice to support Biden in running for reelection, despite poll after poll showing
*  supermajorities of the American people thought he was too old for a second term.
*  It was a choice, if from a career perspective, an understandable one, for zero major Democrats
*  to run against him in a primary.
*  Even his polls showed majorities of Democratic voters did not want Biden to run again.
*  It was a choice if top Democrats in the White House believe Vice President Harris was too
*  weak to run or govern in Joe Biden's place to do nothing about it, to leave the ticket
*  unchanged.
*  Democrats have spent years now choosing to do nothing to solve the most obvious problems
*  they faced in 2024.
*  And now the argument they make is that there is nothing they can do.
*  It's too late.
*  Now to even admit these problems is unhelpful.
*  Even if top Democrats did believe Biden should be replaced, they face a collective action
*  problem.
*  It doesn't serve the interest of any of them individually to try to nudge Biden out of
*  the race.
*  Imagine you're Gavin Newsom or you're Gretchen Whitmer.
*  You want to run in 2028.
*  If Biden drops out, you want to be considered in 2024.
*  Is the best strategy for you to try to push Biden out of the race publicly?
*  Or is it to be the most loyal of loyal soldiers so that if Biden does leave or does lose,
*  you have a strong bond with his donors, with his team, with his supporters?
*  And who wants to be the member of Biden's inner circle goes to him and says, you got
*  to stop this.
*  You're not up to this anymore.
*  It's not a good idea.
*  What happens to your role in the White House the day after that conversation?
*  The other argument Democrats have made is that Biden, yes, he's lost a step on the campaign
*  trail, but his capacity to govern is unaffected.
*  The problem here is superficial, amplified by people in the media like me.
*  You could hear this in Biden's speech the day after the debate.
*  Let me close with this.
*  I know I'm not a young man.
*  It's not the obvious.
*  Well, I know.
*  I don't walk as easy as I used to.
*  I don't speak as smoothly as I used to.
*  I don't debate as well as I used to.
*  But I know what I do know.
*  I know how to tell the truth.
*  I know.
*  I know right from wrong.
*  I know how to do this job.
*  I know how to get things done.
*  That speech calmed some Democratic nerves.
*  He was louder, clearer, feistier, closer to the Biden of the State of the Union than the
*  Biden of the debate.
*  I kept seeing Democrats on certain occasions, and I was surprised to see them on the same
*  level.
*  I was surprised to see them on the same level.
*  I kept seeing Democrats on social media say, where was this guy last night?
*  Where did he go?
*  Come on.
*  We all know it is easier to read off a teleprompter next to a cheering crowd than to manage the
*  chaotic, unexpected demands of a debate.
*  You cannot say the Biden of the teleprompter is a true Biden, but the Biden of, say, this
*  debate answer, and I could have picked plenty of others, is not.
*  For example, we have a thousand billionaires in America.
*  And what's happening?
*  They're in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2 percent in taxes.
*  If they just paid 24 percent, 25 percent, even one of those numbers, they'd raise $500
*  million, billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period.
*  We'd be able to wipe out his debt.
*  We'd be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do, child care, elder care,
*  making sure that we continue to strengthen our health care system, making sure that we're
*  able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with
*  the COVID, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with.
*  Look, if we finally beat Medicare.
*  You don't have to believe Biden is senile, to believe he is diminished by age, as we
*  all will be.
*  I worry about the fact that Biden's worst moments come when he is unscripted, like the
*  debate, or when he stopped to answer questions after his press conference rebutting the special
*  counsel's report and mixed up Mexico and Egypt.
*  This is not the president I want in a complex, high-stakes dialogue with Benjamin and Yahoo
*  or Xi Jinping.
*  Biden's campaign could show us these are flukes, that the president is actually fast and convincing
*  on his feet.
*  There's no end of adversarial podcasts and TV shows and interviews that could have him
*  do.
*  In polls, Biden is losing badly among voters who get their news from social media and YouTube.
*  Why not sit for a long interview with Lex Friedman or Joe Rogan or Charlemagne the God?
*  Why didn't Biden do the Super Bowl interview?
*  Biden sits for fewer interviews than any recent president, and they tend to choose softball
*  interviews.
*  He gives fewer press conferences than any recent president.
*  The idea that this is all just coincidence, that none of it reflects capacity.
*  It's not plausible, not anymore.
*  I've heard some Democrats point to John Fetterman, who suffered a debilitating stroke during
*  a Senate campaign in Pennsylvania, as a kind of grim model here.
*  Fetterman also turned to bad debate performance, but he won his seat anyway.
*  But Fetterman was recovering from a stroke.
*  It was reasonable to expect his capacities to return, as indeed they have.
*  Biden is not going to age in reverse.
*  So let me return to this question.
*  What do political parties do?
*  What are they for?
*  One thing they do, perhaps the most important thing they do, is to nominate candidates.
*  We have a two-party political system.
*  Voters will have two viable choices in November.
*  The Democratic Party is responsible for one of those choices.
*  It needs to make that choice responsibly.
*  What is its job, if not that?
*  But rather than the party acting as a check on Biden's decisions and ambitions, it has
*  become an enabler of them.
*  An enforcer of them.
*  It is giving the American people a choice they do not want, and then threatening them
*  with the end of democracy if they do not take it.
*  Democrats like to say that democracy is on the ballot, but it isn't.
*  Joe Biden is on the ballot.
*  There are plenty of voters who might want to vote for democracy, but do not want to
*  vote for Joe Biden.
*  That's why we see Democratic Senate candidates running well ahead of him in key states.
*  Biden likes to say, compare me to the alternative, not to the Almighty.
*  And yes, Biden is far preferable to Trump, one of the most dangerous men to ever occupy
*  the White House.
*  But that is not the alternative to Joe Biden, not right now.
*  The alternative to Joe Biden on that ballot line that is supposed to represent democracy
*  is Kamala Harris or Gretchen Whitmer or Gavin Newsom or Jared Polis, Raphael Warnock,
*  Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Gina Raimondo, Josh Shapiro, Chris Murphy,
*  and on and on.
*  How does Biden compare to them, really?
*  Biden and his allies say not to look at the man, look at his record, look at all that
*  he has accomplished.
*  Look at the unemployment rate, the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure
*  bill.
*  And Biden deserves credit, real credit, just as all presidents get credit for what happens
*  on their watch.
*  He has been, in my view, a good president.
*  But let's not be naive.
*  He didn't write the Inflation Reduction Act by hand with a fountain pen.
*  The IRA and every other bill passed under Biden's tenure was written by the president
*  and passed by members of Congress.
*  Those votes were organized by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Hakeem Jeffries and their
*  teams.
*  Biden's White House staff, his policy advisors and his foreign policy team, they are Democrats
*  and staffers who would serve in another administration, too.
*  The cabinet members implementing those bills, they are Democrats.
*  Some of these people are possible presidential candidates.
*  The president is important.
*  Joe Biden is important.
*  But he is not alone.
*  He is not irreplaceable.
*  He is part of a party.
*  I'm not going to end this by pretending that there is some easy path forward for Democrats,
*  some surefire way to win in 2024.
*  No path now is without profound risk.
*  An open convention, it's risky.
*  Kamala Harris is risky.
*  To run an 81-year-old with a 38% approval rating who just got trounced in the first
*  debate, it is risky.
*  Biden was losing before the debate, and he is yet to be the next president.
*  Biden is losing before the debate, and he is yet likely to lose after it.
*  To the extent his team has articulated a theory of what was supposed to turn the election
*  around, that was it.
*  The unusually early June debate, which they asked for, where the American people would
*  see Biden and Trump on the stage and be reminded of why they feared Trump and backed Biden
*  in 2020.
*  That theory failed.
*  Joe Biden couldn't pull it off.
*  Look, I understand the risks of a convention.
*  The argument for it politically is not that it can't go badly.
*  It's that it has the chance of going very well.
*  That there is some possibility Democrats would find and pick a ticket that people are
*  authentically really excited about.
*  Not a ticket where the theories are going to come home because they're so afraid of
*  Donald Trump, but that in addition to being afraid of Donald Trump, they actually want
*  these people in the White House.
*  That is at least a possibility at a convention in a way I no longer think it is a possibility
*  with Joe Biden atop the ticket.
*  But I get that it could go the other way.
*  I don't think this is an easy choice.
*  What I think really tips it is not the politics.
*  It's the reality.
*  Biden is not the best choice for the presidency.
*  Not anymore.
*  And look, I realize there is no magic mechanism, no unitary actor called the party that can
*  convince him to step aside.
*  Ultimately, he will decide to do that or he won't.
*  But there are many people in the party with influence over him.
*  There's a question of what kind of support he senses he has from the rest of the party.
*  There is a question of what key people in the party think their role is right now.
*  And what I'm saying is the Democratic Party, it may not end up with another choice.
*  It may indeed be too late.
*  But they should be trying to make another choice possible.
*  Because there's not a plausible way for Democrats to convince voters that the man they saw on
*  that stage on Thursday should be president three years, four years from now.
*  I don't even think Democrats believe that.
*  So to go back to Newsom's question, what kind of party would be trying to make a change
*  after Thursday night?
*  A party that was doing its job.
