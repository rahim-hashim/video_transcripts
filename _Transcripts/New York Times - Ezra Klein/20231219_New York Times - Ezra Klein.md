# How the Israel-Gaza Conversations Have Shaped My Thinking
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [December 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zK6V0ZxWJI)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  So before we begin, one bit of housekeeping, which is we are looking for a researcher on
*  the show, somebody who's going to be central in prepping and creating the structure of
*  these episodes alongside obviously me and the team.
*  We're looking for somebody with a background here in politics and policy.
*  It's an election year and then it's going to be either the first year of a reelected
*  administration or a new administration.
*  So that's going to be an important set of topics for us.
*  If you're interested, we have the application linked in show notes or you can find it at
*  But for today, you all sent in a lot of questions.
*  I have seen a number of them and they're very difficult and I am nervous about answering
*  them.
*  But here to join me with it, which is also a great way of introducing her to all of you,
*  we have a new senior editor on the show, the great Claire Gordon, who I used to work with
*  back when we worked on Netflix's Explained show together, which was great then.
*  I am so glad that she is on the show now and she's agreed to come pepper me with all of
*  your questions and not let me refuse to answer them.
*  And so Claire, welcome.
*  Thank you, Ezra.
*  It's great to be here.
*  Well, let's get started.
*  The questions that came in overwhelmingly were in four buckets and the first of those
*  buckets is Israel-Palestine.
*  Oh, good.
*  The easy bucket first.
*  Just to warm you up.
*  So and then the US politics, AI, and then personal questions.
*  And then we'll end with a fun rapid fire round that I know you are not dreading.
*  Great.
*  All right, let's do it.
*  So question one.
*  In the first episode that you put out after October 7th, the very first thing that you
*  said was that your mom had asked you to promise her that you wouldn't talk about this publicly.
*  And then you proceeded to do that quite a bit.
*  So the question from a listener, this is Marissa H., is how have your relationships with family
*  and friends been impacted by your conversations or the positions that you've made publicly
*  on Israel-Palestine?
*  And then I would add to that, how does your mom feel?
*  My mom feels proud of me, as she usually does.
*  My mom is wonderful.
*  I guess the thing I would say about this is that I don't have the view in my personal
*  life.
*  And to some degree, I don't think other people should have the view in their personal lives
*  that it is my job to police and change the opinions of the people I love.
*  And there are people I love with opinions on this issue that differ markedly from mine
*  and differ markedly from mine in ways that I sometimes find personally difficult.
*  I don't think the point of family or being in a relationship is getting everybody into
*  alignment with you.
*  And I think if you do, you're just going to harm a lot of relationships.
*  And I also don't think you're going to be persuasive to the extent you are ever persuasive
*  to somebody who is pretty far from where you are.
*  It's because they feel safe with you and they feel heard by you such that they are open
*  over long periods of time to the gentle pressure of your differing views.
*  And you don't get that if over the holiday table, you start yelling at them about their
*  terrible opinions.
*  So no, no relationships have frankly been altered at all.
*  But I've been watching people drive themselves mad on social media over this.
*  And I think social media is about the worst possible place you can imagine to discuss
*  something as complicated and emotional and difficult as Israel-Palestine.
*  I mean, you're talking about one of the hardest things to discuss even in person.
*  And I think that it's like this thing very far away, but that is so emotionally immediate,
*  right?
*  The images, the horrors, the fear.
*  And so I think people get into this question of it has activated such emotional intensity
*  in them.
*  What part of it do they have any traction on?
*  For most of us sitting here, we can't end the war there.
*  We can't create peace.
*  We can't do anything.
*  So what can you do?
*  You can maybe police the views and feelings of the people right next to you.
*  You have no power over what's happening there.
*  But maybe you have power over the people in your Instagram stories feed, or maybe over
*  the people in your family.
*  And I don't want to say you shouldn't talk about difficult things with people you know
*  you should.
*  But it's not a place to try to exert control.
*  So not trying to persuade your loved ones of your views feels like great advice.
*  But I'm curious how that actually looks in practice.
*  Say it's the holidays, you're at the holiday dinner table, a loved one expresses a view
*  that you deeply disagree with.
*  Maybe you find it even upsetting.
*  And then what do you do next?
*  How do you engage in that conversation if you're not trying to persuade them?
*  I'm not saying I never try to persuade a loved one of my views.
*  And I'm not saying that I never get annoyed or angry even at the views of those around
*  me.
*  I do like it's much easier for me to discuss this issue with the hundreds of thousands,
*  millions of listeners of the show than it is with my own family.
*  Oftentimes it's so much harder when it's people you love.
*  But if I have a view that's different than theirs, once that conversation is done, I'm
*  not going back to it.
*  It's not my project inside my own family.
*  It just isn't.
*  And it has been a sobering and humbling thing for me as a professional political communicator
*  to realize that oftentimes I cannot convince the people closest to me of things I really
*  believe.
*  I saw somebody on social media on threads who is saying that their rule on this is that
*  before they try to persuade someone they know of something, they ask three questions.
*  I'm not saying I do that.
*  But that struck me as a very wise rule that before you ever try to talk somebody else
*  out of their position, you ask three questions about how they got to that position and what
*  it means to them and what is behind it.
*  And then you're going to learn something more about a position that feels very alien to
*  you.
*  And if you're trying to persuade them, you're going to know a little bit better what it
*  is you're working with.
*  Okay, well, let's see if you can persuade anyone with these next questions.
*  So this one is from Mark C. About a month ago, we had Yossi Klein-Halevi on the podcast
*  and you'd asked a question about the BDS movement.
*  That's the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement.
*  In the context of talking about all the nonviolent efforts Palestinians had made to bring international
*  attention to their cause and put pressure on Israel.
*  And he had responded that BDS, quote, has as their goal the destruction of Israel.
*  So Mark, who's been a supporter of BDS and definitely did not have as his goal the destruction
*  of Israel, his question was, did Halevi have a point there?
*  And what are your feelings about BDS generally?
*  So what Halevi is saying there, as I understand it, so if you go to the Boycott, Divestment,
*  Sanctions website and you look at their three big planks, the third one is right of return.
*  Palestinians who were expelled during the Nakba or fled during the Nakba, who can trace
*  their ancestry back, so this would also then include, you know, children, grandchildren,
*  etc. have the right to return into Israel.
*  I think Halevi and most Israelis understand that as a way of destroying the state of Israel.
*  During my conversation to Harkbacone, he mentions his estimate of, I think, 14 million Palestinians
*  worldwide who can claim some ancestry here.
*  Israel has 7 million Israeli Jews, 9 million in population.
*  So to Israel, I think that is a way of saying you're going to destroy the state of Israel.
*  It isn't you'll destroy it by looting it and burning it to the ground.
*  But I mean, Halevi is very clear on this in the conversation.
*  To him, that is a kind of destruction.
*  I think right of return is a lie that has been told to people.
*  I mean, that is a part of it that kind of breaks my heart.
*  I have talked to people who work in refugee camps in Jordan, Egypt, etc.
*  And they've met people who have the keys to their grandparents' house on a necklace around
*  their neck because it shows like you're going to go back there someday.
*  And you're not.
*  That is not how these conflicts have ever worked.
*  I think the idea that international law tells you it will work that way is a lie international
*  law is telling you.
*  There's no right of return for the Jews who were expelled from Iran.
*  There's no right of return for the people expelled during partition in India and Pakistan.
*  No right of return for the Germans expelled after World War II out of Eastern Europe.
*  About 900,000 Jews is the number I've heard were expelled or left or fled different parts
*  of the Middle East during this period.
*  There's no right of return for them.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  So BDS, I have mixed feelings about it.
*  I think for a long time Israel is trying to be the thing that it says it is, right?
*  Like a Jewish state, but one trying to absorb across democratic principles and to work in
*  a humane way.
*  I think that it functionally ended.
*  And so using boycott and abasement and sanction techniques to try to put pressure on them
*  to go in a different direction makes a lot of sense to me.
*  To do it with the idea that you're going to get right of return.
*  If you take that seriously, and maybe you do, maybe you don't.
*  I think a lot of people did not think about that as what they were really doing when they
*  were involved in that movement.
*  I don't think that makes sense.
*  And I do think this is a real dividing line right now on the left in terms of different
*  imaginations of ways as conflict ends.
*  There are a lot of people who want to see a kind of humane outcome across the lines
*  where Palestinians get a state and they actually have authority and autonomy over that state.
*  And that state is functionally the West Bank and Gaza.
*  And that is a real thing that could not be achieved right the second, but could be achieved.
*  And then there are people who think you need right of return, which is a kind of single
*  state solution.
*  And I don't see any world where you're getting that.
*  And so I think it's actually then ensures the continuation of this world.
*  And this world is very, very, very bad.
*  So my thoughts on BDS are mixed, but I do think that in terms of the tactic, putting
*  aside some of the goals, but in terms of the tactic, I think that if you believe what is
*  happening to the Palestinians is and has been deeply unjust, and I do, and you want to see
*  resistance work, and I do, and you want there to be a reason to do nonviolent resistance
*  as opposed to armed resistance, and I do, then I think you have to ask yourself if you're
*  not going to be open to that tactic, what is it you would be open to?
*  What is it that would matter enough that it might actually be listened to?
*  Because like the occasional op-ed is not doing it.
*  So we had a couple questions from listeners who just struggled with the idea of Zionism
*  and the idea that Israel needs to be a Jewish homeland and a Jewish majority state.
*  And so I'll put the question this way.
*  One of the driving forces behind the creation of Israel was the idea that the Jewish people
*  needed a Jewish homeland to be safe, that that was a lesson from history that's been
*  learned many times over, certainly a lesson from the Holocaust, that if Jews didn't have
*  their own state dedicated to protecting them, it was very possible that the Jewish people
*  long-term wouldn't survive.
*  Do you think that's true?
*  I am not certain, and in fact somewhat doubt, that Israel makes Jewish people safer.
*  It has not been obvious to me that that is true for a long time.
*  Now it is believed by many Jewish people, so you're hearing a view of mine that is not
*  necessarily widely held.
*  But if you think about where you have a lot of Jewish people collected in one place, where
*  that place is dangerous, where a disaster could happen that could wipe out a lot of
*  Jews again, I think you would say Israel.
*  You can have a very different view than me on that.
*  I actually just don't think that view is relevant really to what comes next.
*  The state of Israel is a state.
*  If you could prove that it made it 10% likelier to have a mass disaster for Jews, it would
*  not cease being a state.
*  It has other reasons for existing.
*  There are people who live there and have families there and businesses there and communities
*  there and make art there right now.
*  And so I think that that kind of sits on its own now.
*  I don't think that what you believe about Israel's role in the security of worldwide
*  Jewry actually tells you very much about what to think about Israel.
*  In my view, we actually sort of overly particularize the situation, which I know is a weird thing
*  for me to say, given all the shows we've just done on and about its very specific history
*  and so on.
*  But I do think we make it a little too special.
*  Israel is a state formed like many states in violence.
*  In my view, it was not formed by UN resolution that the UN never had any intention or capability
*  to enforce.
*  Israel was a place where different peoples had settled on that land and had a claim on
*  that land going far back.
*  I really, really dislike the idea that Jews had no relevance to that land, right?
*  The kind of settler colonialism idea.
*  When people read the book at the core of Judaism, it is an account of the Jewish people being
*  expelled violently, repeatedly from Jerusalem, which was not located at that time in New
*  Jersey.
*  It was there in the same place it is now.
*  There was a very ancient connection for the Jewish people to that land.
*  When did the statute of limitations on Jewish expulsion run out?
*  So the UN does try to partition, but the UN doesn't enforce that.
*  They don't send a military to do it.
*  So instead, what there is is a war.
*  And the Arab countries try to wipe out this new state of Israel.
*  Israel tries to not be wiped out and Israel wins.
*  And that is what creates the state of Israel, a war, just like many other states.
*  And then the boundaries and borders change in other wars, like the 1967 war.
*  So I sometimes think people make this into something weirder than it is.
*  Israel is a state.
*  It is a state formed partially in war, like many states have been.
*  It is a state that will protect its borders.
*  And it is a state that is for the people who it has defined itself as being for, which
*  is true for most states.
*  I think saying it's a Jewish state and that's so weird.
*  I mean, America is a state for Americans.
*  China is a state for the Chinese, Brazil a state for Brazilians.
*  States are imagined communities.
*  Nationalities are imagined.
*  Now, it doesn't mean that you won't get killed trying to cross a border.
*  The fact that something is a story doesn't mean it can't kill you.
*  But it does mean that it is not so unusual for a country to define who it is for.
*  And then if you are not in that definition, you don't get to come there and have citizenship.
*  Mexicans cannot just come to America and say, why live here now?
*  I'm a citizen.
*  Nor can Canadians for that matter.
*  And I think if you just look at it as a normal state that is going to try to act as many
*  other states would in this scenario, a lot of things just come clearer.
*  Israel's a state.
*  itself and maintain its own internal sense of cohesion.
*  And like that is what most states do.
*  Most states would not be open to immigration policies that made their current majorities
*  minorities overnight.
*  Like that is not how most states operate.
*  The people of France would not agree to that policy.
*  The people of Chile would not agree to that policy.
*  This isn't as weird, I think, as people try to make it out to be.
*  The end goal for Israel is not exception, it's normalcy.
*  And I think being kind of unable to see that about it, both kind of in terms of how it
*  acts and in terms of where it needs to go, is often a big part of the problem here.
*  Do you think that people's inability to see that, thinking that a Jewish state is somehow
*  unique or strange compared to other states, is that mostly just because of how recent
*  a political project Israel is?
*  Or does anti-Semitism play a role in that?
*  I mean, it might be a bit of both, but I don't think you need anti-Semitism as an explanatory
*  factor here.
*  What Israel is, is formed very much by the Holocaust.
*  And so it is also a kind of international project in different ways, and it has attention
*  internationally in other ways.
*  But part of it is simply the way the world, but particularly America, focuses there because
*  of our relationships, because of who we are and who is there.
*  And yeah, because it is recent.
*  And so you can see the way the clay was shaped in a way that history and time has made other
*  things look more settled.
*  And then it connects, of course, to the stories of the three major Abrahamic religions.
*  It creates a different sense of it.
*  I mean, I also think the religious dimension here cannot be understated.
*  But I think all that actually sometimes makes it hard to see how normal what is happening
*  there is.
*  So I wanted to go back to something you said earlier about how the idea that Israel makes
*  Jews safer hasn't seemed obviously true to you for a long time.
*  And I wonder if that's because of some specific recent forces.
*  One, the memory of the Holocaust being a living memory.
*  And that's becoming less true every year.
*  I mean, for kids born today, the Holocaust is their great-grandparents generation or
*  their great-great-grandparents generation.
*  So the protective power of that memory is fading.
*  And then secondly, the state of Israel, that maybe Israel has actually been a victim of
*  its own success in a way, that it's given Jewish people such a sense of security in
*  the world that more people no longer see it as necessary.
*  I mean, are there other things that make you think that the very long and consistent history
*  of Jewish pogroms and persecution is less likely to repeat itself in the future?
*  I do not believe the age of pogroms is done.
*  There's a line that anti-Semitism is a light sleeper.
*  And I believe that.
*  I think you see it right now.
*  I think the question is, in that world, is it obvious that Israel is a point of safety
*  rather than a point of vulnerability?
*  And I would say it is not obvious.
*  That's maybe the real thing I would say here.
*  I don't know.
*  I find that Israel, because of how complicated the place in which it is, is, because of what
*  it takes for it to survive, what it took for it to be founded, is that a place Jews can
*  run to or is it a place in which they're vulnerable?
*  I mean, people keep saying Hamas's attack was the single largest killing of Jews in
*  one day since the Holocaust.
*  What should that make you think?
*  I think in the 20th century, Israel's necessity was real.
*  If only it had been formed earlier, how many could have been saved?
*  I think people often don't realize that the world Jewish population still has not rebounded
*  to the level it was before the Holocaust.
*  I mean, that is the size of the decimation.
*  How many families, how much art, how much literature, how much genius, how much was
*  lost?
*  I still think that is something we cannot get our arms around.
*  But I don't know.
*  I'm a Jewish person.
*  Do I feel safer?
*  Do I feel like there's less anti-Semitism in the world right now because of what is happening
*  there?
*  Or does it seem to me that there's a huge upsurge of anti-Semitism and that even Jews
*  in places that are not Israel are vulnerable to what happens in Israel?
*  And one reason I think Jews in the diaspora do and should have a voice as to what is happening
*  there is we are vulnerable to it.
*  It is both potentially in some circumstances a place that could protect us, but it is also
*  in other circumstances a place that could endanger us.
*  But I don't know.
*  And I will say that I was at a training because I want to go to Israel.
*  So the Times makes you do this training called a HIFAD training.
*  And it's a training for journalists and NGO workers and humanitarian workers who might
*  be operating in a conflict zone.
*  And you do a lot in this training, including first aid and this and that.
*  But one of the things that ended up happening is a march where you're kind of in the scenario
*  of in this case, it was we were in Africa in a particular state in Africa in this and
*  the terrorist group of Al-Shabaab was going to be advancing and that they were killing
*  foreigners and it was meant to sort of test these skills.
*  They were teaching you about how to correctly dive away from grenades and how to run amidst
*  a live fire.
*  So where are you?
*  What's the scene?
*  We're in a forest.
*  Like we were actually outside.
*  And then at some point there's a capture scenario and it's like people with guns and they're
*  firing blanks around and they're screaming at us and you're face down.
*  And this was not a scenario about Jewish people.
*  This is Al-Shabaab is just advancing and they're going to kill foreigners.
*  We're not in Israel here.
*  This is not what's going on.
*  And just one of the people, one of the actors doing the scenario just starts screaming,
*  who's the Jew here?
*  Who are the Jews here?
*  Give up the Jews.
*  Are you all willing to die to protect a Jew?
*  And there's something about the fact that when you're trying to make a realistic scenario
*  of capture, that the thing people's mind goes to is, well, probably a terrorist group would
*  hunt down all the Jews first.
*  I don't know what makes Jewish people safer or less safe.
*  It's not always obvious to me.
*  I'm not telling anybody to take my judgment on this, but the sense of threat is real.
*  And then of course, like there's a reality of who is really unsafe right now.
*  Gazans.
*  Like people living in Gaza are the people dying in mass numbers right now.
*  This is like a very hard set of things to hold.
*  And so yeah, it's just a very hard set of things to hold.
*  Okay, so one final question on Israel-Palestine.
*  A listener asked whether you would, using this platform, call for a ceasefire.
*  I don't think that's my...
*  Let me separate that into two things.
*  Do I think there should be a ceasefire?
*  I think Israel should stop doing what it's doing.
*  I do not like the structure of this conversation where the only two options on the board are
*  all out ground invasion and pummeling and destruction of Gaza and ceasefire.
*  Going back to the Zach Beecham episode, our second interview on this, I believed then,
*  I believe now in a limited targeted continuous counterterrorism strategy.
*  I don't think Hamas, the threat posed by Hamas, was ever really about Hamas's capabilities.
*  I mean, even now we know that Israel had all the intelligence it needed to stop what Hamas
*  did.
*  They had the actual plan as a document.
*  They had analysts who saw Hamas doing training operations, and they dismissed it.
*  And then what Hamas did was not technically complex.
*  It's not because, oh, in one of the tunnels, they had such advanced weaponry.
*  I mean, you had paragliders here.
*  You had people just running through in normal vehicles, like it was guns.
*  Some of this is simply about normal security and getting your intelligence right.
*  Then the idea that you're going to drain Hamas of the danger it poses with a death toll in
*  Gaza like this, that this is not going to lead to more radicals and more vengeance,
*  I don't buy it.
*  I have not seen a good argument made for it.
*  Israel's not reporting in some public way where people can check the work, what they
*  have achieved, and why we should believe it is worth the toll it is taking on Gazans.
*  So it is my view that degrading Hamas's capabilities is important.
*  I have not been convinced in the reading and interviewing I've done that the way they have
*  done it was a targeted or even necessarily wise way to do it.
*  I believe to a large degree that what Yossi Klein-Halivi said was true, that Israel executed
*  a massive overwhelming response to reestablish deterrence.
*  I don't believe deterrence was a problem.
*  I don't believe that if you had told the leaders of Hamas that their operation would succeed
*  as easily as it did, and their fighters would go on to butcher as many Israeli civilians
*  as they did, and to take as many Israeli hostages as they did, that the leaders of
*  Hamas would have said, given that speculative world, oh, Israel's a paper tiger, they're
*  not going to attack.
*  And so I don't think deterrence actually had to be reestablished.
*  Now other people disagree with me on that, but I think there were other ways to do it
*  that would have been wiser and more targeted and more limited, and the cost in the way
*  the world sees Israel now, and the cost in how many people in Gaza want vengeance now,
*  and how much radicalization there will be now, and how many children who no longer have
*  their parents will grow up wanting to avenge those deaths.
*  I think those have to be weighed somewhere.
*  I don't think, I mean, people are calling for a ceasefire almost from day one here.
*  I don't think any state could be attacked by Hamas or anything like Hamas the way Israel
*  was and do nothing.
*  But counterterrorism is possible, and it could have been done over a long extended period.
*  And it would have been given Israel's capacities on surveillance, you know, pretty straightforward
*  to be attentive to anything that looked like a training exercise and anything that looked
*  like amassing of power.
*  And the kind of counterterrorism I'm talking about and the counterterrorism experts talked
*  about here, I mean, that could be very violent and it could be very destructive, but it's
*  not going to displace 80% of the entire population of Gaza and lead to this kind of death rate
*  among children.
*  I don't think this was about at some core level Hamas.
*  I think it was about Israel showing that if anything like this was done to it, the cost
*  would be staggering.
*  And I don't think that was ever the question here in anybody's mind.
*  But at this point, I yeah, I mean, when is when is the cost too high?
*  I think we've passed that point long ago.
*  All right, ready to move on?
*  I am ready to move on.
*  US politics, chapter two.
*  So this question from Jonah P about Kevin McCarthy's dramatic ouster from the speakership.
*  And at the time, Democrats, you know, very quickly were like, we're not going to help
*  him at all.
*  Don't like the guy.
*  This is the Republicans problem.
*  Was that wrong?
*  Should the Democrats have given him the votes, given where we've ended up now?
*  I think that's actually a bit of a myth.
*  There were Democrats willing to save McCarthy.
*  What they were not willing to do was save him for nothing.
*  So there were last minute negotiations among centrist Democrats and Republicans to come
*  up with some kind of a deal here where Democrats would give McCarthy the votes he needed.
*  And in exchange, it would get things like potentially seats on the powerful rules committee.
*  They would get some concessions for the quite big move of crossing the aisle to save a Republican
*  speaker.
*  And the person who did not want to make a deal like that is Kevin McCarthy.
*  I think it's really important to say this.
*  Kevin McCarthy, from the beginning of this whole shenanigan, he said he would not cut
*  a deal with Democrats to save his speakership.
*  And when you're not willing to play politics and you're not willing to make the trades
*  to get votes, then you don't get to play politics and you don't get the votes.
*  I don't think it is actually the Democratic Party's job.
*  And more than its job, I don't think it is an appropriate thing for it to do to collapse
*  its own interests as a negotiating partner and give Republicans something for nothing.
*  Votes don't cost nothing.
*  The idea that Democrats should have saved McCarthy for nothing, I don't buy it.
*  Not for the good of the country?
*  I don't think it necessarily would have been better for the country.
*  I mean, at some point, the Republican Party has to get back to making deals.
*  At some point, the Republican Party has to get back to acting like a governing coalition.
*  And possibly, if they lose their majority over this, some of them would be more likely
*  to do it next time.
*  Look, I don't know, and nor does anybody know, what will bring the Republican Party back
*  to some level of normalcy.
*  Maybe it's simply not possible for the foreseeable future.
*  I think that's more the camp I'm in.
*  But it is not good for Republicans.
*  It is not good for moderate Republicans.
*  It is not good for Republicans as a whole to have a deeply inexperienced, deeply radical
*  speaker.
*  That is going to be a good issue for Democrats in the elections.
*  Abortion in particular is probably Democrats strongest issue right now, and Mike Johnson
*  is a great foil for them on that.
*  I don't think you should try to help bad Republicans get elected because it makes it easier possibly
*  for Democrats to defeat them.
*  I think that's a very high risk strategy.
*  But I also think that for Democrats themselves to have any negotiating leverage at all, as
*  a normal governing party themselves, they have to be able to take reasonable positions
*  and stick to them.
*  The idea that the Republican Party has become such a deranged institution that the cost
*  of the other party saving their speaker is no longer a deal of some kind.
*  Look, when McCarthy wanted the speakership in the first place, he made all these deals
*  with a far right of his own party, including that any member of it could call a vote on
*  his speakership.
*  He made deals to become speaker.
*  He had to make deals to stay speaker.
*  He decided that not staying speaker was better than making any deal at all with the Democratic
*  Party.
*  And like that was his choice, not the Democrats choice.
*  So for this next question, we had a bunch of folks write versions of this, and I would
*  paraphrase them all this way.
*  There is a non-trivial chance that Trump will be the next president.
*  If he wins, he's promised to do a lot of stuff that sounds pretty scary.
*  And people are writing and warning about this, but at the same time, it mostly feels business
*  as usual.
*  Liz Cheney's line that we're sleepwalking into dictatorship.
*  So what do you make of that cognitive dissonance?
*  How worried are you?
*  I am quite worried.
*  We're going to do a lot more coverage of this in 2024.
*  I think though that the thing people underestimate is that right now, people's attention still
*  is not focused on Donald Trump or frankly on 2024.
*  And as that changes, as you have primaries and he wins primaries and assuming he does
*  become a Republican nominee and then you do have the coverage of a kind of two candidate
*  campaign, the things he's saying will get a lot of attention.
*  Now, Donald Trump has won in the past despite saying completely insane, crazy things.
*  But in that election, he lost the popular vote and almost lost the election.
*  To be fair, if you look at relevant electoral college states, 2020 was quite close, but
*  Trump lost a lot of ground.
*  I think when people are heavily exposed to the yet more extreme version of him, I don't
*  think that's going to go well for him or for the Republican Party.
*  Now the danger of Biden having some kind of issue around his age or I don't know, some
*  of the wars that he has the US backing in Ukraine or in Gaza, they go really badly,
*  right?
*  There are things that could happen that could then let Trump slip through, but this is going
*  to get more real and we're just not there yet.
*  But I do think people should be worried.
*  And the other thing is to me, what's really dangerous here is not necessarily that Trump
*  himself has become more extreme, though I do think the evidence that he has is convincing.
*  It's that the Republican Party around him has become more extreme and more enabling.
*  That's true of the House Speaker who we just mentioned, Mike Johnson, but it's just true
*  of who are the members of the Republican House majority.
*  It's true of the members of the Senate.
*  It's true of the kinds of people who would work in a Trump White House.
*  Trump would and people around him would know better how to choose nominees from their own
*  faction than Trump did in 2016 when there was a constant tension between the sort of
*  traditional factions of the Republican Party who are staffing a lot of key positions and
*  Donald Trump and kind of the direct people around him and including some of his family
*  members and so on.
*  So if you do have another Trump term, you're going to have a more extreme Trump governing
*  a more extreme Republican Party with a staff that is more dedicated to making Trump's whims
*  and revenge fantasies come true.
*  And that is an extraordinarily dangerous situation.
*  All right, now on to AI.
*  So in the recent sort of catching up on the World of AI episode that you did recently
*  with Casey Newton and Kevin Roos, you all talked about the future boom that you expect in AI
*  And you were all pretty casual about it.
*  You talked about how you think that your kids will grow up maybe not to have real friends.
*  So they'd have both.
*  I think my kids will have real friends too.
*  And then Casey joked about how there were going to be Fox News segments in the future
*  freaking out about this, how Silicon Valley had turned a generation into shut-ins who
*  only hung out with their robot friends and it would be this silly moral panic.
*  And while I was listening to that, I was just thinking, that sounds like a pretty reasonable
*  reason to be panicked.
*  And a couple listeners had the same reaction I did.
*  Keith Kay called the idea of chat bot pals replacing human friends, quote, one of the
*  most insane and depressing things I've ever considered.
*  And Hugh Kay asked, surely the evidence is pretty clear that we need human to human connection.
*  The loneliness epidemic won't be met by human to machine, right?
*  I mean, I definitely believe humans need human to human connection.
*  Now it could be that it's complimentary, right?
*  Like, look, when you look at the world of Star Wars, there are AIs there, but also there
*  are human relationships there and there's simply a flow between them, right?
*  You can be buddies with C-3PO, but still have a relationship with Han Solo.
*  I don't know.
*  So I mean, that's one world, possibly, right?
*  Our pets don't make it so we don't have human to human connection.
*  And maybe AIs will be helpful in that, right?
*  Maybe you can imagine a world where we wanted people to get out more and see people and
*  AIs are in some ways like helpful coaches.
*  Like, hey, get out of the house.
*  If you have a therapist, the therapist often tries to get you out of the house, get you
*  doing things.
*  Maybe AIs will be like that.
*  But I think you should be nervous about how weird the world might get on the rapidity
*  of the time frame.
*  It could get really weird.
*  I think the thing that's going to slow this down is not technology.
*  I think the technology is functionally there, at least on the AIs as buddies question.
*  I think it is going to be kind of generational discomfort.
*  I think people my age are, you know, I'm going to turn 40 in a couple months.
*  I think people my age are going to have trouble having AI friends.
*  I think kids won't.
*  And so what's going to happen is like generational turnover.
*  And I don't think we know how that's going to look or feel.
*  I don't think we have any way of really thinking about that.
*  I think we haven't done nearly as much thinking about that as we have about workplace disruption.
*  And my gut is it in the next 20 years, there's actually more effect on society in terms of
*  social disruption and upheaval than job disruption and upheaval.
*  I can be proven very wrong on this, but that has been my claim.
*  And for now, I still feel it's true.
*  And yeah, I don't know what to tell you.
*  It's weird.
*  I don't know what to do about it.
*  I don't know how to feel sufficiently or insufficiently alarmed.
*  I don't know how to prepare my kids for it.
*  How do you think about a world that you've never lived in before?
*  I mean, I think the best thing to say about it is at least sci-fi has been thinking about
*  this world for a long time.
*  And so there are actually all manner of stories about it.
*  And so in certain ways, humanity is very well prepared on one very important level, which
*  is a level of story.
*  But that's only one level.
*  And that doesn't mean we're prepared enough.
*  Yeah, some of those stories end pretty badly.
*  Some of them do.
*  I mean, I always say this, but if you've not watched her, I think it's a 2013 Spike Jones
*  movie in which Scarlett Johansson voices an AI that is a personal assistant, but that
*  the lead character falls in love with.
*  And I think it is such a prescient movie.
*  So like you should watch that movie.
*  But the way the movie in some ways resolves like this key issue is at some point the AIs
*  get bored of us and leave, which is a recurrent trope, by the way, in sci-fi.
*  It didn't like just come from there.
*  But what if they don't?
*  Like in some ways, I think what's scary about that movie is that it ends so neatly and it's
*  sort of needed to.
*  But if you just go right up to the end and it doesn't end neatly, and you just have this
*  world where the AIs are more interesting than the people, to the people, then what?
*  I don't really think that it will destroy the desire for human to human contact.
*  The desire for touch is very profound.
*  The desire to be chosen.
*  I think a real problem with AI relationships is going to be that they are unchosen in a
*  way.
*  It is important to my conception of myself that my best friend, that my wife, that the
*  people I love, most of them, I mean, my family has kind of stuck with me.
*  And I'm paid to be here, but I chose to work with you.
*  But they could choose at any time not to be, right?
*  They keep choosing me.
*  That's important for who I understand myself to be and my sense of self-worth.
*  I think people want to be chosen.
*  And so there's going to be a lot of subtle things that even a very interesting AI can't
*  do.
*  But that's not everything.
*  And that might not be as important to three generations from now.
*  So who knows?
*  Well, you brought up your kids a moment ago, which is a nice segue to the personal bucket
*  of questions.
*  And this I just thought was a really beautiful question from Robert M. And he talked about
*  how when his kids were born getting this, quote, pure hit of universalism, I was so
*  aware both of my child's individual profound importance to me, but also how that experience
*  was repeated billions of times the world over.
*  And then he went on to talk about how over the years, his kids are now teenagers, that
*  feeling faded and their world shrank to the size of the nuclear family.
*  Quote, the direction of travel is towards protecting this tiny bit of territory from
*  the world.
*  And so he wanted to know, have you felt pulled in that direction too?
*  I think that's a really beautiful question.
*  It reminds me of something George Saunders has said, which is that having children, I'm
*  going to get this quote wrong from memory.
*  So this is a kind of directionally right.
*  Reimbued the world with moral urgency because everybody in it deserved to be loved as he
*  loved his daughters.
*  And I feel that.
*  That's one reason I found covering things like Gaza emotionally unbelievably wrenching.
*  I mean, to sit with the violence done to children by Hamas and then the violence done to Gazans
*  in Israel's reprisals.
*  It's a lot of children.
*  It's a lot of children, children dying and children losing.
*  But then that tension that he points out between the sort of universalism and the particularism,
*  the recognition that every child is as important and is loved by somebody as much as your child
*  is important and is loved by you, or hopefully is loved by somebody that much.
*  And the way having children focuses you on your own family and on taking opportunity
*  and giving it to them.
*  I know the advantages my children have being my children, right?
*  Compared to being born in a much poorer place to a much poorer set of parents in a rural
*  area.
*  And I know the blessings I'm showering on them.
*  And you know, and like, that's just a very, very hard thing to negotiate.
*  I sometimes on these things don't think that there is much better answers than that you
*  like a rule for yourself on charity.
*  And like mine, which is, you know, you can hear this from, you know, various modern sources,
*  but I actually took it from tithing, which is, you know, my family, the floor for charity
*  is 10% of pre-tax earnings.
*  And it can be and often is higher than that.
*  But it can't be lower than that.
*  If it's lower than that, then, you know, we're just way too focused on our own family.
*  And I mean, it's still like can be up to 90% focused on your own family.
*  But I don't like have a way to answer this.
*  But I really do think that universalism is something to try to hold on to.
*  I think it is precious and I think it's important and I think it is true.
*  Well, I think a good follow up question to that is Joan Case, what kind of school would
*  you like your children to attend?
*  And what do you hope their education will bring them?
*  I want my children to attend public school.
*  I overwhelmingly attended public school.
*  There was like one year when I didn't, but I attend public school.
*  I went to public university and that was important to me.
*  And it's important to my self-conception.
*  The only thing hard for me about this question is that I hated school and I suffered a lot
*  in it.
*  And the way my brain works, to sit at a desk listening to somebody lecture is torture.
*  I just had to do it again for a couple days and it was torture again.
*  I remembered how useless it is to me, like how hard it is for me to focus in that fashion.
*  I mean, I just sat and fought with that like my whole childhood.
*  You know, your job is people talking at you.
*  But me talking with them.
*  Me talking with them.
*  I can learn very, very fast in conversation.
*  Weirdly, I can listen to podcasts because it can be the second thing I'm doing.
*  If I'm walking or washing the dishes or whatever, I can handle that.
*  I don't call into teleconference calls as a reporter even now because I just can't absorb
*  any of the information.
*  Like, it's just how I don't know.
*  Like it's why I graduated high school with a 2.2.
*  I just can't learn that way.
*  I wonder if I would be willing to have my children hate school and like just kind of
*  suffer in it day after day after day the way I did.
*  Would I be willing to bear that?
*  And on the other hand, I think that the fact that I did was good for me.
*  And it created a really deep desire after failing for so long in my own life to succeed.
*  And my best friends today are my best friends from then.
*  The fact that I didn't do that well in school didn't stop me from having an amazing life.
*  So I don't know.
*  When you were younger and had a crummy grade point average, what was your story about that?
*  Did you have that clarity of just...
*  No, I didn't understand this until much later.
*  I mean, you look at any media about school and it's like the kid starts drawing and ends
*  up in the world of their own imagination.
*  I mean, that's what the show is about.
*  And I felt that was really happening to everybody in the way it was happening to me.
*  And I actually didn't understand.
*  I mean, it sounds crazy now to me to say it.
*  I didn't understand that other people were sitting there paying attention to and absorbing
*  the material.
*  Look, it was grueling for me and for my family.
*  I don't know what to say about it.
*  And eventually everybody just settled in to the idea that I was some kind of weird underachiever.
*  And that was your story that you were an underachiever.
*  Absolutely so.
*  That I was smart but lazy.
*  And I did a lot of reading on my own and definitely seemed interested in the world.
*  And it was a continuing puzzle to my teachers and to my parents and to myself.
*  And at a certain point, people got bored of yelling at me or it didn't work and they stopped.
*  And I just kind of dragged myself through the rest of it.
*  And I did really well in the SATs and that got me into UC Santa Cruz.
*  But that was it.
*  Like, I got saved by testing.
*  Because I was a good test taker.
*  Otherwise, I understood myself to be a fuck up.
*  And then I actually turned out when I found something that worked for my mind, which was
*  blogging, to be not just like a hard worker but an insanely hard worker, like functionally
*  was the single biggest surprise about myself to ever happen to me or frankly to the people
*  around me.
*  Right?
*  Like the one thing that was obvious about me was that I wasn't a hard worker.
*  It's the reason I care a lot about context.
*  That I believe that people are different in different contexts.
*  Like I've had the experience of being the same person in one context and I'm a total
*  disaster for years, years and years and years.
*  And then all of a sudden, the exact same set of traits, the ability to hyper focus on a
*  book and hyper focus on things I'm interested in and write quickly, all of a sudden, like
*  that's like a path to success and fame.
*  And I didn't change.
*  Like the world changed.
*  Like the context for me and the world changed.
*  So yeah, you know, you got to recognize like the stories you tell are often not really
*  about you.
*  They're about the interaction between you and the place that you're in.
*  I'm curious if that's left a mark on you in other ways, just through your formative years,
*  having the story about yourself and being told that you're a screw up in terms of a
*  desire to prove yourself by working so hard, like punishing yourself for something or having
*  a chip on your shoulder about it.
*  I think it is certainly a plausible read of me.
*  For a time period.
*  But at the same time, I was always very obsessive about the things I was into.
*  And so it isn't like my at least subjective experience of finding political blogging was
*  like, I'm going to show them.
*  I found it.
*  I loved it.
*  I often can't stop.
*  I mean, when you ask like, does it leave other marks on me?
*  One of the marks that leaves on me is I don't really believe people are that responsible
*  for their success or their failure.
*  A lot of things that we bracket into the you deserve credit for this bucket, like are
*  you a hard worker?
*  In many ways, I would work less hard if I could.
*  I just can't.
*  Like it's compulsive.
*  So I don't know.
*  I like like it definitely affects my politics.
*  I just attribute a lower percentage of people's life outcomes to things they are choosing
*  to do.
*  Then to things that are sort of innate, which is why I kind of believe that what you want
*  as a society is for individuals to believe in individual responsibility and for society
*  to not believe in individual responsibility all that much.
*  And so, you know, obviously we want to encourage people on the margin to make good decisions.
*  But I just don't think people should be punished that hard for their failure.
*  failure is like not really up to people and nor is success.
*  And so even if we want to create the conditions that maximize success for any individual,
*  I don't think morally the reasons that people fall short are often up to them.
*  Do you have any personal goals for yourself in 2024?
*  Ooh, yeah, I do.
*  I mean, I always have like a million.
*  If I don't have a list in my head.
*  So one is that I'm just spending a lot more time.
*  And this is going to come out in episodes we're going to do like right at the beginning
*  of the year, actually.
*  I'm spending a lot more time thinking about aesthetics and how to have a personal sense
*  of taste, how to actually know what you think is beautiful and what you are moved by and
*  how to be more attuned to that in the world.
*  I feel actually very far down that path with music, which over the past five, six years,
*  I think my taste has really shifted in.
*  And now I really know what moves me and I can hear something and map it.
*  I'm sort of just beginning to build that visually.
*  And that's really important to me this year in terms of visual art, in terms of my own
*  personal style.
*  I would like just like my life to be more beautiful and to appreciate beauty more deeply
*  in it.
*  I always just want to sleep more and sleep better.
*  I'm a dad of kids, young kids, and it really shows me just how much of my life, how well
*  it is going is about how well I'm sleeping or not sleeping.
*  And so that's something on my mind that I want to work with.
*  And I got to get my book done this year.
*  I ended my book leave early to come back and do the Israel-Palestine.
*  Yeah, how's that going?
*  Not great at the moment.
*  I don't want to say not great.
*  Book leave was very productive until it ended.
*  But I mean, in 2024, somehow amidst everything else, I have to get this book done or disaster
*  will fall upon my head.
*  So you know, take that for what you will.
*  Now for a new experiment for the show.
*  The rapid fire round.
*  Oh, fun.
*  All right, so how long do I have on each of these?
*  15 seconds.
*  I don't think I've ever answered a question in 15 seconds.
*  Me and the team, we were debating whether really for you rapid fire was more like two
*  minutes.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Whittle it down.
*  All right.
*  Okay.
*  First question.
*  What is the best and least cliched piece of parenting advice you've received or given?
*  It is harder to parent yourself than to parent your children.
*  I want to know what that means, but no follow ups.
*  It's up to you.
*  But and it is at least as important.
*  You covered the UFO story earlier this year.
*  Do you believe something genuinely anomalous happened?
*  Is there a there there?
*  I believe there's something unexplained in the multi-sensor data captured across a bunch
*  of these UFOs.
*  I don't believe that has been explained away.
*  Do you do anything to minimize your personal carbon footprint?
*  Yes, among other things, I don't eat meat.
*  So you're a human being.
*  Thank you.
*  Not a question.
*  But you're also as a public person and a person on the internet, a brand.
*  How do you feel about your brand?
*  And how accurate is it as a representation of Ezra Klein, the human?
*  I don't know about my brand, which has been different at different times.
*  And I don't like to think of it as a brand.
*  I think the version of me on the podcast is like 65% accurate.
*  What has been your favorite episode of the Ezra Klein show during the past year and
*  why?
*  I do not have an on the spot answer to that, but I've been proud of the the Israel Palestine
*  series has been meaningful to me.
*  It feels like change, technological, social, political change is happening faster and faster
*  that more has changed since 2003 than change between 83 and 2003, for example.
*  Do you think that's true?
*  I didn't until AI and now I do.
*  If our current civilization survives for another few thousand years, what do you think kids
*  in the year 5000 something will learn about this current moment or say this century in
*  their history books, if anything?
*  This is a 15 second answer question.
*  And you've already used up five.
*  I suspect it'll be technological changes, specifically AI and gene editing.
*  And last question, where do you see yourself in 10 years?
*  Ten years older.
*  All right, that's a wrap.
*  That was the last question.
*  And I just wanted to quickly say thank you to all the listeners that took the time to
*  send in questions.
*  Thank you for so many brilliant ones.
*  And sorry if we didn't have the time to get to yours.
*  And of course, thank you, Ezra Klein.
*  Thank you.
