# Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota has a message for Republicans about the â€œliberal agenda."
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA)
*  Republicans, they may not admit it, they love the free school meals and lunch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=0.0s)]
*  I guarantee you a lot of them like paid family medical leave. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=4.48s)]
*  Small employers who couldn't afford to compete against a best buy in Target who offered paid [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=8.52s)]
*  family medical leave, now could offer and recruit employees. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  So now they're saying, look, I'm paying a little bit into this, this program works, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=16.48s)]
*  my employees are loyal to me, and boy, they can go home and be with their kids and keep [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=19.66s)]
*  them healthy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=23.84s)]
*  It's just, we have to show them that this isn't, there's nothing strange about this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=24.84s)]
*  They'll try and say this, ultra liberal. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=29.16s)]
*  That's where we need to be more specific. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=31.32s)]
*  Oh, do you mean the free school lunches? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Are the roads and bridges we built in this town? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=35.0s)]
*  Is that what you're speaking about? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=37.04s)]
*  Governor, you spent a surplus money on this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=38.6s)]
*  Yeah, you mean when we eliminated social security tax for most of seniors? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=40.84s)]
*  That's the one that most bothers you? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=45.08s)]
*  There's never a specific. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=46.68s)]
*  They don't give you a specific on what the liberal agenda is. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=47.68s)]
*  And we have to do a better job of saying this is what it is. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=52.66s)]
*  This is the things that you're getting. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fs9W9ZCXA&t=55.84s)]
