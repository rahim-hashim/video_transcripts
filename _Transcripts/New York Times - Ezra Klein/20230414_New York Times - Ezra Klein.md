# This Philosopher Wants Liberals to Take Political Power Seriously
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [April 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czia0vz8CM0)
*  I'm Ezra Klein. This is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  It's no secret that liberalism has its problems. Government struggles to build as much or as
*  fast as it used to. Processes meant to be small-d democratic get captured by special
*  interests or paralyzed by polarization. Democrats have a lot of policy ideas and they even have
*  policy wins, but they struggle with the fact they actually have to govern and so are accountable
*  for a system that frustrates people. On the other side, MAGA conservatism, which is pretty
*  fully taken over the Republican Party at this point, it doesn't have much in the way of
*  consistent policy ideas. It doesn't take responsibility for the system. And that is one place, not
*  the only place, but one place it gets its power. It's able to voice the frustration
*  people have with the government they don't feel like they have a voice in. The two often
*  seems to work only for elites or for somebody who isn't them. But there are ideas out there
*  for how liberalism can break out of this stalemate. Some argue for a liberalism rebuilt around
*  making government able to achieve what it promises. Others emphasize directly addressing
*  historic injustices, bringing in groups who have been left out as a way of restoring legitimacy.
*  But Danielle Allen's idea is a bit different. Allen is an important political theorist and
*  classicist who's tried to turn theory into action. She actually ran for governor of Massachusetts.
*  She's used to perch at Harvard to help build these huge and really unusually diverse and
*  interdisciplinary working groups on COVID policy, on tech policy, on democracy. And
*  now she runs a group partners in democracy. And Allen's vision, which she puts forward
*  in her new book, Justice by Means of Democracy, and yeah, I know I'm saying democracy a lot.
*  Allen's vision is something called power sharing liberalism. To her, one mistake liberalism
*  has made has been that it is willing again and again to deprioritize political equality
*  in favor of material redistribution. But she thinks renewal isn't going to come from
*  people just getting more from government. They're going to have to be more full participants
*  in government. And that's going to require fundamentally overhauling the system. And
*  maybe more than that. It's going to require potentially constructing entirely new possibilities
*  within it. To quote Allen, representation as design cannot work under current conditions.
*  We have no choice but to undertake a significant project of democracy renovation. So what would
*  that look like? As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at NY times.com.
*  Danielle Allen, welcome to the show.
*  Danielle Allen Thanks, Ezra. Great to be here.
*  Ezra Klein See the fascinating essay not long ago where
*  you outlined three basic strains of thinking about what the Democratic Party with the left
*  should become. You broke it down to movement progressivism, to abundance progressivism,
*  which is power sharing liberalism. So I wanted to begin with the first two, the non-Daniel
*  Allen ideologies. What are movement and abundance progressives and what do you think they get
*  right and what do you think they miss?
*  Danielle Allen So movement progressives have done really extraordinary
*  things, energizing young people, building inclusive coalitions, intersectional coalitions,
*  and really calling out the problems in our contemporary economy. So there's a lot of
*  good there.
*  Ezra Klein Who are they?
*  Danielle Allen So there'll be familiar people, the squad
*  in Congress, for example, in various ways. I think Black Lives Matter feeds into movement
*  progressives, but certainly AOC is a sort of standard bearer. And absolutely the sort
*  of Green New Deal perspective has had a lot of the movement progressive energy associated
*  with it.
*  Ezra Klein So then you have abundance progressives, which
*  I'll note that I'm very associated with that set of ideas, but you're responding to it
*  to a version proposed by Misha Chellam, who is somebody who is in California and is a
*  political reformer and you're responding to an essay of his in your essay. So how do you
*  understand abundance progressivism?
*  Danielle Allen So abundance progressivism wants to get stuff
*  done. So they have been frustrated with what they see as sort of movement progressives
*  tying things up in identity politics, seeking perfection as opposed to pragmatically achieving
*  near term solutions. In addition, they have a very different model of the economy. So
*  as you've been writing about sort of a model of the economy based on supply side progressivism,
*  activating production, activating supply, not letting things get tangled up in regulation
*  and so forth, even when those regulations are for good justice purposes. So in that
*  regard, they are less statist in their orientation than movement progressives. They're also very
*  technocratic. They tend to have a real focus on expertise and policy solutions. They don't
*  for that reason, sort of tap into the same kind of grassroots coalition building energy
*  as movement progressives have done.
*  Jared Ranere So let me offer two provocations on that as
*  somebody who's been sort of trying to shape some of this, which is one I often think of
*  abundance or what I like to call supply side progressivism as being in a way more statist
*  as its antagonist or its set of questions being around the ways in which the left has
*  sometimes knowingly, sometimes unknowingly made it very hard for the state to act or to achieve
*  the goals it sets out for itself. In many ways, one of the things that I find myself trying to
*  unearth is what I think of as the anti-government progressivism that is often lurked in the
*  heart of progressivism without being really admitted into the national narrative.
*  And then the other thing that I thought was interesting about what you were saying is I
*  don't often think of it as intention, particularly with movement progressives as you define them,
*  that a lot of the concerns there are about old processes that have been captured, you know,
*  NIMBYs, old regulations in California, you have a lot of things built in the progressive era,
*  right, the sort of early 20th century progressive era, that people feel drifted into playing a
*  different purpose. And so there's impatience or concern about a lot of process. But because so
*  much of the process is old, and the movement progressives are new, I don't really think of
*  those two things as being quite so connected. You know, I think the place that I've seen,
*  you know, people like Misha, for instance, make the case for abundance progressivism,
*  they have absolutely focused on getting things done effectiveness of government. So I wouldn't
*  say that it's status as such status is understood as sort of big state picture and an expectation
*  that you deploy policy, you know, from the top down, with as much public sector dollars as
*  possible, they tend to be abundance progressive as I see it tend to be much more interested in
*  private public, you know, sort of mutual facilitation, redesigning mechanisms of
*  governance, so that the private sector can operate more effectively and the public sector
*  can operate more effectively. So yes, I mean, there's an orientation towards process and procedure.
*  And, you know, I think, again, just drawing on Misha's criticisms of movement progressives,
*  I think that's a place where he sees insufficient and he and others see insufficient attention to
*  that question of process, what it takes to get things unstuck to undo capture, as you put it,
*  that's accrued over time. I do think that point about process and legitimacy is important. I do
*  think of an important idea here. And one that I think you challenge really interestingly,
*  as being Nicholas Begley, who's a law professor who had on the show not long ago, makes this point
*  that he thinks government legitimacy comes from its outcomes comes from getting done the things
*  that the people want done, not from having a legitimate or overly legitimate process that he
*  thinks liberals have aired by focusing too much on legitimizing through process, and have not been
*  concerned enough about the outcomes. So that does feel to me, like one of the moves that abundance
*  progressivism is trying to make this this sort of outcome oriented focus as opposed to process
*  oriented focus. Does that seem about right? Yeah, no, I think that's fair, except, you know, the only
*  additional bit right is that it's an orientation towards outcomes that includes redesigning process
*  to get to outcomes. But it's not process as such. It's not a view that if you just have an inclusive
*  process, that's okay. Nor is it a view that proceduralism is the answer to everything. So
*  it is absolutely outcomes oriented for sure. And so before we get to power sharing liberalism,
*  I want to ask about one other faction that it feels like we should talk about here, but doesn't
*  really get mentioned in the essay, which is the Biden administration for lack of a better term
*  for it, right? Normie Democrats, maybe Obama ism is the right way to think about this, because I
*  think it's really in lineage to him in that administration. How do you understand what the
*  center of the Democratic Party is? What what faction and ideology that represents? Well, I think an
*  interesting thing has been happening with the Biden administration. I mean, I think they actually
*  really are trying new things in that they're not really just a kind of continuation of Obama
*  era policies. They've really put energy and new thinking into a sort of form of industrial policy,
*  for instance, that's a pretty dramatic change of direction. They're working really hard to rethink
*  some of the sort of basic infrastructure for labor, for you know, how you think about connecting
*  people between labor, education, opportunity and the like. Of course, they're driving really hard on
*  the energy transition, but thinking of that in sort of really systematic ways. So I think in that
*  regard, they share some of the aspects of abundance, progressivism, you know, certainly seeking
*  and kind of abundance of renewable energy, for instance, they I think are not at a place yet
*  where they have a real read on how to be effective across jurisdictional levels. So I see some, you
*  know, new things kind of coming into existence in what they're doing, but really constrained by
*  constricted by the kind of clunkiness and antiquarian facts of our existing institutional
*  arrangements. So tell me about what you call power sharing liberalism. So power sharing liberalism is
*  an effort to turn the dial on a long history of liberalisms that the western world and this country
*  in particular have seen. So take liberalism in the first instance as committed to the protection of
*  rights. That's what makes it sort of liberalism. So protecting freedom of expression and freedom
*  of association, but also freedom to participate, to vote, to run for office, to be one of the people
*  that is co-creating the public norms and constraints that shape all of our lives.
*  So liberalism is that sort of protection of rights and power sharing liberalism recognizes that all of
*  the versions of liberalism we've had 18th century, 19th century, 20th century have always had a fatal
*  flaw in their heart. And that fatal flaw was to reserve power to the few. So in classical liberalism,
*  late 18th, early 19th century, power, political power is reserved to people who hold property,
*  more or less white men for the most part as property holders. Then even in the 20th century
*  as we begin to move towards some kind of universal inclusion, we get the right to vote for women.
*  Finally in the middle of the 20th century we get voting protection for African Americans. We nonetheless
*  see a political system that is still reserving power, concentrating power in particular in
*  elites of various forms, moneyed elites, technocratic elites and the like. So power
*  sharing liberalism is really the goal to build in the 21st century a version of a rights protecting
*  constitutional democracy where power is genuinely shared throughout organizational structures,
*  throughout political institutions. So there's a question in this about what power flows from.
*  And one of the moves I understand you to be making, you should tell me if this is an incorrect
*  understanding, is that most, I think familiar forms of liberalism have understood power
*  fairly materially or at least have emphasized materialist forms of power, which is to say that
*  they're interested in redistribution. They're interested in do people have enough money,
*  both for sufficiency, but ultimately they're worried about power imbalances from money to
*  the extent they think about power much at all. And that you think that there has been a
*  not a wrong emphasis, but an overemphasis on the material dimension of politics such that you have
*  a liberalism that is fine so long as there's enough redistribution, but isn't attentive to the degree
*  to which people actually participate in the democracy and would be comfortable with a world
*  where there was a lot of sufficiency, but actually not a deep form of democracy. And so the power
*  sort of been misdefined. Does that track? Am I reading you correctly? Yep. Now you've read me
*  very well. So material matters matter for sure. Folks need to be capacitated for political
*  participation. So there needs to be a certain kind of material baseline, but it is absolutely the case
*  that I take material questions, economic questions as being for something else. That is, they are
*  supports for the opportunity of people to live flourishing lives and to live a flourishing life
*  is to be empowered in your personal life, but also again in that co-participation, co-ownership
*  of our public spaces and public life. Now this is not to say that everybody has to participate,
*  but that possibility, that real possibility for meaningful participation in public autonomy, as
*  well as personal autonomy is, I believe, necessary for human flourishing. And yes, I think that our
*  approach to focus on GDP as the measure for all wellbeing, and then we take GDP and we redistribute
*  it as needed when the economy itself is not spitting out egalitarian results, actually misses
*  a core element of human wellbeing. Focusing that way has permitted us to degrade worker power,
*  worker empowerment. And in that context, it means that in all kinds of ways, we have blocked ordinary
*  citizens out of steering the choices of the polity. So I am reactivating, reanimating
*  democratic purpose broadly and trying to embed that democratic purpose even in our political economy.
*  LARSON Tell me a bit about the lineage of thinkers you feel yourself to be drawing on here. What
*  tradition are you unearthing?
*  KUZNICK So that's a great question and kind of a beautiful one. And you know, another person you
*  should have on is somebody named Melvin Rogers, who is at Brown and has a great book coming out,
*  but it's a beautiful book about the history of African American political thought in the 19th
*  century. And what this book does is sort of unearth a treasure trove of ideas and thinking that have
*  been really obscured in our traditional narratives about the history of political philosophy.
*  So basically, the traditional narrative in the 1700s into the early 1800s, you have an approach
*  to thinking about freedom and equality and the like that goes by the name of republicanism. Small
*  R doesn't invoke the political party. What it means is it's a conception where well-being flows
*  from that public participation and not merely from what we do in our private lives. And then in the
*  early 19th century, that sort of smaller republican view gets replaced by the sort of classical
*  liberal view, where it really is about our private lives. You know, we want to be left alone,
*  pursue our own business, accumulate wealth, you know, do what we want to do with our wealth.
*  And that's it. Like, that's where well-being comes from. Sort of the public participation side
*  doesn't really matter very much. And so the sort of traditional story is that that kind of liberalism
*  just sort of washed away that smaller republicanism and sort of that's what we've had ever since. But
*  in truth, African-American thinkers throughout the 19th century fighting enslavement, then fighting
*  the failure of reconstruction, fighting Jim Crow, have always maintained commitment to the notion
*  that power needed to be shared. That the fundamental flaw in the American political system was the fact
*  that power was not shared. So in that regard, what I've done in my book is really take the sort of
*  traditional picture of liberalism and flip it and say, actually, look, you know, you've gotten this
*  picture of justice completely wrong because you haven't taken power seriously. And if we start by
*  taking power seriously, if we start by recognizing that sharing power equally is the necessary
*  foundation for human flourishing in a democratic society, well, then you actually get a different
*  theory of justice. So I think that book is called The Darkened Light of Faith, Race, Democracy, and
*  Freedom in African-American Political Thought and comes out in September and does look great.
*  It's brilliant. But I do want to hold on this question of power, because even having
*  read a bunch of your work on this, I feel like it is still a little bit opaque to me.
*  So you think of more traditional democratic socialist liberalism or labor liberalism,
*  and in the old you manage what you measure. I understand what those measures are. The poverty
*  rate, or to be more precise, maybe the supplemental poverty rate that takes into account government
*  transfers because I'm a nerd, the median wage numbers, the unemployment rate, health insurance
*  rates. What are the measures of power for you? The measures of power for me do flow from the
*  political sphere. And in some sense, they're not surprising. They are things like the right to vote,
*  but they're also things like the right to run. Is that actually activated? Who's able to use it?
*  From what kind of backgrounds is running for what kinds of offices? Who's holding which offices?
*  And then also, what I sort of refer to as the right to see and shape your community. I've
*  started a new organization called Partners in Democracy that has sort of built around
*  those three categories and indicators for them. And if you take Massachusetts as an example,
*  what you'll find is that the right to vote in this sort of actual activation of it is very
*  maldistributed. It is highly skewed towards property holders in Massachusetts. People who rent are much
*  less likely to vote. I mean, the disparity is really quite extraordinary. We have a huge housing
*  crisis in Massachusetts. As you know, I take there to be a direct connection between the
*  fact that the electorate itself, the activated participating electorate is skewed to property
*  owners and the fact that we are not addressing the problems that face those who rent in the
*  state of Massachusetts. So those are the kinds of metrics that you can point to and across any given
*  domain, whether it's the political domain or organizational domain. It is a question literally
*  of sort of who is sitting in seats of power and then also how are decision-making mechanisms
*  actually structured? Are they allocating power in ways that tap into the sort of voices of all those
*  in the community or not? So one way it seems to me you could try to decompose some of this is to
*  think about, and I'm sure I will miss categories here, but there's participation, right? How many
*  people are voting. There's representation, how representative are the people who sit in power.
*  And for lack of a better term, maybe depth or democratic depth, because participating through
*  voting and participating through regularly going to community or local meetings and participating
*  through deliberative democracy structures that we have not yet set up, those are very different.
*  I mean, you can have a pretty thin level participation just because you show up to vote in
*  biannual elections. And that's sort of different, I think, than really being part of steering
*  the ship of state. So can you go through a little bit more depth on those? Because I kind of
*  don't buy that if we got the voting percentage up just a bit or even quite a bit, if we did
*  universal mandatory voting as they have in some countries or compulsory voting,
*  that that would really solve your problem all that deeply.
*  Right. No, I mean, I wouldn't put everything on that binding stretch of the imagination.
*  So I mean, it really is across all sectors of civil society and political institutions.
*  So take the media as an example, the question of who shapes the agenda for what stories get
*  published, which perspectives or points of view make it into our shared narratives,
*  that formation of the kind of horizons of our cultural imagination is another way in which
*  power is distributed. I have a student named Justin Pottle, who's written a great dissertation
*  is working on a book on exactly this and the way in which we ought to actually be sort of
*  reorganizing some of the infrastructure for our media ecosystem with a view to achieving that
*  full inclusion of voice and perspective. The agenda that sort of populates our different
*  decision-making steering bodies, you know, sort of flows from that media ecosystem.
*  So all of that matters. When you look at any given sort of process of policy development,
*  you sort of take COVID as an example, right? You have people sitting in private institutions,
*  corporations, universities, making decisions, advising policymakers, really without much
*  input or engagement from those who are most powerfully impacted by the policies that they're
*  pursuing. And I do think when you look at sort of basic research design in universities,
*  you can have a different approach to how the research agenda is developed. And there are
*  people who are starting to build out co-designed research agendas, really digging into the
*  question of, well, what are the actual problems people in a specific place want to solve or need
*  to solve? And then how can researchers work with those folks in a specific place on developing the
*  necessary research agenda? You change that kind of thing. That is a reallocation of power and a lot
*  flows from that. So it's not just voting by any stretch of the imagination. And at some level,
*  I think it's a kind of people can read this and feel it's a sort of overwhelming concept because
*  everything that you look at can achieve a more egalitarian distribution of power than currently
*  exists.
*  So in your essay, a critique of make of abundance progressives on the other side is for assuming
*  quote, there's a trade off between modes of decision making that are responsive and representative
*  and getting stuff done. And I think they might say these modes of decision making are not responsive
*  and representative. But the problem is that again, and again, and again, when well meaning
*  progressives create a bunch of new processes to be responsive and representative, eventually they
*  become captured by special interests by the status quo by people who own a house now, or don't want
*  things to change. And they do in fact impede getting stuff done. And they do in fact make
*  government less able to get to the outcomes that it is promising people or that is wanted from
*  people. So I'd like to hear you answer a bit of that criticism in terms of what power sharing
*  liberalism might create. What about the worry that adding on a lot of consultative process,
*  given that that requires knowledge and interest in time, and a lot of people just don't want to be
*  that involved in government, ends up being a boon to those who have a reason to use those processes.
*  And it ends up as another thing that gets captured by the powerful.
*  Sure. So I'm going to break that into two questions. And I think you asked a question about
*  capture. And you also asked a question about consultative processes. And of course,
*  you linked to them. But I think there are two distinct issues there. So on the subject of
*  capture, for starters, you know, there's this great essay from the early 20th century by sociologist
*  Michele about the iron law of oligarchy, right? And he makes the argument that every human
*  organizational form everywhere in history over time has always tended over time to oligarchy,
*  to capture. And I take that to be basically right in an important way with the result that
*  the work of democracy is to continuously resist capture. There is no end of history. There is no
*  state of rest for democracy. Democracy is the work of resisting capture by powerful interests and
*  restoring power sharing disorder over and over and over again. So we have to do work to introduce new
*  governance mechanisms in the place of those that are not working. Now, this doesn't always have to
*  mean consultative process exactly. I mean, I think one of the things that is exciting about the time
*  we now live in is there's lots of room for experimentation with alternative approaches
*  to decision making. So there's a great experiment that's unfolded in the Colorado legislature
*  recently where the legislature used what's called plural voting to prioritize areas of legislative
*  concern. So this is a voting method where everybody gets, let's say, 100 ballot points when you start
*  out and you can vote one ballot point, you can put one vote on a thing you care about, or if you
*  really care about it, you could put all 100 on that thing. So every vote that you're going to place
*  on something, you have to sort of pay more for. So your first vote costs you one ballot point.
*  If you vote for something twice, it'll cost you four. If you vote for it 10 times, it'll cost you
*  100 points, right? So it's a sort of squared function there. And what that does is mean that
*  when people are indicating their preferences, if they feel something very intensely, then they have
*  to sort of sacrifice any kind of engagement on something else. And so it produces a much clearer
*  sort of mechanism for sorting out intensity, for really requiring people to make choices, to make
*  sacrifices, to prioritize and the like. And people who are using this mechanism are finding it very
*  productive and then productive as well for the sort of ensuing discussions about what should be done.
*  So I think that that's a kind of really neat mechanism that comes out of thinking and game
*  theory and economics. It's also the case that new tech tools, even including AI tools and so forth,
*  will afford lots of possibilities. We will have lots of ways of clarifying more efficiently,
*  you know, what some kind of common ground points of view are. I'm sure you know about the experiments
*  in Taiwan with the VTaiwan platform, which can take highly contentious issues and help people
*  more quickly see it's a sort of really rapid process of social discovery to see where the
*  potential points of agreement or solution are. So I think, you know, it's not a matter of using
*  consultative processes as we've known them for the last 40 years or something like that. I think
*  this is a time for very serious innovation. I always find myself very caught at this point,
*  and I think it's good here to do what you did and separate out some of the different domains you
*  could work in. So consultation and voting mechanisms, but you mentioned plural voting,
*  or people might also have heard of it as quadratic voting. And maybe I am being dim about this,
*  but a critique you make in this case of the abundance progressives is that their fundamental
*  failure is technocracy. Their fundamental failure is belief that the experts can get together into
*  a room and make good decisions, and that those decisions will be legitimate and that that is the
*  way you should govern. And I think that's actually a quite true critique of at least many people in
*  that space. But I think that there is definitely a form of technocracy that afflicts the conversations
*  about democracy and governance, where people keep proposing what are, I think, just truthfully,
*  ever more complicated ways of voting when you're beginning to give people an allocation of ballot
*  points that then as they allocate more of them, it goes up by the square, so they're spending
*  their ballot points more quickly. It's not that you can't imagine a way of simplifying that through
*  like a front end calculator system, but it is a little weird. And I think places where we've seen
*  people try things that are not even quadratic voting, but simpler. So there have been experiments
*  with things that are go by names like democracy bucks, where we actually give people a voucher.
*  So the broad community has money to spend on supporting political candidates with the idea
*  being that we're going to democratize the money that candidates get so that everybody has something
*  they can spend on the political ideas of their choice. And we see very low take up of that. I
*  mean, it has been experimented with if I'm not wrong in Seattle. And it was very, very, very
*  disappointing to the people backing that project, how few people actually spent these free bucks
*  they were giving them. And that was in a much less complicated structure than quadratic or plural
*  voting. So I guess I pushed this critique back at you. Isn't there a danger of technocracy here and
*  particularly a danger of thinking that too many people are like Daniel Allen or frankly, like
*  Ezra Klein, which is they'd like to spend a lot of time thinking about ever more interesting ways
*  to be involved in government. But in fact, like what we see again and again, is people don't want
*  to spend that much time on it. But they want us for things to run pretty well. And beyond that,
*  to not really be that bothered. You know, again, I'm going to break your question into two parts
*  there. Break it into as many parts as you'd like. And the first one about democracy renovators,
*  as I call myself as technocrats, which there's a lot to talk about there. And then the second one
*  about what does participation mean in the lives of most people, as opposed to those who sort of
*  most intensely are motivated by democratic commitments or something of the sort. So,
*  I mean, yes, you are 100% right that the democracy renovation field or democracy reform field,
*  as it's often called, is powerfully afflicted by the problem of technocracy. And that is something
*  I've also been a critic of for what it's worth. So in the work that we're doing in Massachusetts,
*  I mean, one of the things we're working really hard to do is to draw a connection between any
*  given democracy issue and substantive outcomes. So right where you started, in other words. So,
*  for example, in Massachusetts, we don't have same day voting, people have been fighting for same day
*  voting for 20 years. It's held up because, you know, various parts of the leadership in the state
*  legislature are not interested in it. But people have been fighting for 20 years. Who is at the
*  short end of the stick of that? It's really people who rent because they move, their addresses change,
*  they have to have registered, you know, prior to the last 10 days before an election. And if they
*  haven't gotten it done, they can't vote. And that just doesn't happen to people who own property and
*  stay in one place. So in that regard, there are a lot of housing justice groups, advocacy groups in
*  Massachusetts. And one of the things I'm doing is sort of making the case, you know, if you care
*  about housing, if you care about changing the dynamics around the rates at which rents are rising
*  and the like, it's really, really important to also connect that to the same day voting issue.
*  So I do think that the sort of critique of the abundance progressive that any given effort needs
*  to deliver for people materially in their lives is absolutely right. I mean, so democracy isn't just
*  about the abstraction. The point of democracy is it's supposed to support human well-being.
*  So, you know, in the ancient Roman phrase, salus populi, supremo lax esto, right, like the health
*  and well-being of the people is the supreme law. That Roman phrase is what lies behind the language
*  of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. When the declaration talks about
*  achieving safety and happiness for all of us, and when the Constitution talks about the welfare,
*  the general welfare, it is exactly that same concept of salus populi, the health and well-being
*  of the people. So democracy has to deliver for that, for sure. And all those metrics that you
*  started with are absolutely still pertinent. But the question is, getting to them depends on another
*  set of metrics, which is about how power is distributed. So that's where, you know, you cannot
*  get to an understanding of the connections between the material things that people need or need to
*  see changed and the power distributions without letting people talk from their own lives, from
*  their own experiences about the barriers and hindrances they see to what they're trying to
*  pursue. So I believe that that approach to thinking about the relationship between power and material
*  outcomes gets you out of the technocratic way of thinking about democracy. So that's sort of thing
*  number one. And then thing number two on the subject of, you know, well, lots of people don't
*  really want to have to spend their time participating. I think that's largely true. However,
*  you can feel safe doing that only if you think that the folks who hold power are in some sense kind of
*  loosely connected to you by some sort of tie of affinity or the like. So the less well you actually
*  feel represented, the more you are in fact going to want to participate. So that really matters
*  then that those people who are not so well represented or don't feel safe, given sort of who's
*  in leadership in a particular organization or political space, you know, gotta have access to
*  that path to power. So that's really what the story is here. And I will say too, just from, you know,
*  sort of grassroots work that I've been doing, you know, a lot of people feel shut out. A lot of people
*  feel like they don't have access to voice and choice. And that is not just instrumentally
*  problematic for them. It is problematic at an existential level. It afflicts and undermines
*  sense of dignity. It afflicts and undermines a sense of freedom. So I guess I would just caution
*  against underestimating the importance of the genuine experience of empowerment and freedom
*  in people's lives. But it actually strikes me there's a tension between the two sides of that
*  that answer you gave that that side of outcomes and that side of representation, feeling safe
*  with the people who are in power. So if you think of power sharing liberalism, as the liberalism is
*  doing something important there, that it is actually speaking to, you know, what we think of
*  as liberal outcomes, liberal ideas of justice. A lot of people really, really, really don't want that.
*  And, I mean, I'm not telling you obviously anything you don't know here, but you are going
*  to have people win elections. And one thing that has been striking to me in American politics over
*  and over again, is how unsafe as we hit higher levels of polarization and enmity, people feel,
*  even with fairly banal, moderate, modest members of the other side. I mean, there are many Republicans,
*  particularly MAGA Republicans, who find Joe Biden genuinely horrifying. They really, really,
*  really don't like that guy. The reaction against Barack Obama, who is, I think, about as pluralistic
*  and open a major politician as we've had in national office, in my lifetime at least,
*  in response to him, arose Donald Trump, arose the entire Tea Party and MAGA movements.
*  So I think I'm skeptical that you can find that kind of safety within a system where there really
*  are winners and losers in a divided polity. I guess maybe you can reassure me on this,
*  because what I see is a lot of evidence that anybody will become demonic to the other side,
*  even if they actually do make a good faith effort at trying to absorb more opinions. And I just,
*  I'm not sure process fix can open us up beyond that. So in my book, Justice by Means of Democracy
*  goes well beyond process, right? There's a different vision for political economy.
*  There's a different vision for how we think about culture, work, and society and the like.
*  And so I think you're describing our present conditions quite well, but I don't think that
*  our present conditions show us the limit of what's possible for human beings seeking to build
*  free self-government for free and equal citizens. So the short of it is that to have the sort of
*  power sharing that I'm talking about does require the set of stable norms and guardrails,
*  the kind of things that Dan Ziblatt and Steve Levitsky talk about in How Democracies Die. So
*  instead of getting rid of those norms and guardrails, mutual forbearance,
*  toleration, you do not prosecute the war till the last person is dead. It's rather,
*  it's not winner take all, it's winner take nothing. Or at best, what winners get to do is chair the
*  committee, but they do not slash and burn. There's sort of a set of norms and guide rails that are
*  necessary for a sustainable, durable constitutional democracy. And so if you want freedom,
*  if you want freedom to last, then we need these norms and guardrails. So then we don't have them
*  right now. So to your point, that's absolutely correct. We'll give an example of what you're
*  talking about there. Forbearance, tolerances, those are values, but what guardrails don't we
*  have that we should that you think would make people feel safer? It's not that the guardrails
*  themselves would immediately and directly make people feel safer. The guardrails are about how
*  people make decisions together in legislative bodies. So for example, Mitch McConnell
*  famously said, coming back into the majority at a certain point, well, winners make policy and
*  losers go home. That is the antithesis of a stable democratic norm. The point of a democratic
*  structure filled with committees is that the losers stay on the committee. So the winner gets
*  to chair the committee, but the loser stays on the committee. And the point should be that there is
*  in fact a process that does keep the losers in the mix in terms of some kind of synthetic outcome.
*  We are a long way from that. I am not pretending that we are anywhere close to that at this point
*  in time, but it is that kind of set of norms that can yield a solution space that's not visible just
*  from a simple readout of public opinion polls on a polarized society. And that is what the real work
*  of democracy should be. It's about solution space. It's about creating more solution space. This is
*  where the philosopher, Martius Senn, I think is really the person who's best articulated this.
*  And he's got a powerful argument about the value of democracy as really a knowledge machine,
*  knowledge engine. And he makes the case that it is really notable that if you look around the history
*  of the world, democracies are a form of regime type where they're not afflicted by famines.
*  They're not afflicted by famines because the process of social discovery means that knowledge
*  moves to decision makers in a fashion that permits course correction over time and does keep broadly
*  a sort of some kind of concept of the public good operating. And again, we have led a lot of the kind
*  of norms that sustain that erode. So I think your questions are fair ones from the point of view of,
*  you know, how could we ever get to a place like when you're describing Danielle, because we're
*  very far from that now. But I don't think we can read out from contemporary realities, like what the
*  actual possibilities for a healthy concept of democracy are.
*  Matthew 10 I think Mitch McConnell is a good figure to think about a bit here,
*  because I think one of the innovations he is most associated with, and he did not start this,
*  but I think he's taken it to or did at various points take it to an extreme,
*  is utility of the filibuster to enhance division as opposed to deliberation. And so I think if you
*  step back on the US Senate, you might say, hey, this is great. This actually implements what
*  Daniel Allen is saying, the losers don't have to go home because in fact, the Senate has a super
*  majority requirement, such that the winners cannot pass very much without bipartisan support,
*  because very rarely does anybody have 60 votes in the Senate. And so you might think, okay, great,
*  the more filibustering there is, the more powerful the filibuster is, the less polarized the Senate
*  is going to be the less polarized we're going to be as a country. And we've seen the exact opposite,
*  because in practice, it isn't actually valuable or valued or rewarded for the minority party to
*  engage in cooperation. And something I think the common understood very, very cleanly is that if he
*  could use methods that were built for deliberation for slowing things down, for making sure both sides
*  had a say to simply stop the Democrats in this case, from being able to move forward at all,
*  that would make the Democrats look ineffective, it would split their coalition, it would excite
*  his own base. And on the other side, the kinds of Republicans who over and over again, at various
*  moments did decide to try to move into a bipartisan space. I mean, many of them got primaried out in
*  the Tea Party primary waves, they got knocked out in primaries by people like Donald Trump and the
*  voters who supported him. I think the theory, this has been a long war for me in American politics,
*  the theory of the filibuster should work. It just said it doesn't because it doesn't seem to be the
*  thing, like voters could reward the politicians who acted as a filibuster says they should act
*  and come together. But in fact, we've seen particularly on the right, though not only
*  that this actual rule that should create a ability for the minority to be always involved,
*  actually creates a way for the minority not to be involved, but to be obstructive. And in being
*  obstructive to have a quicker path back to the majority and in doing that to sort of further
*  divide things. So what did then the filibuster get wrong? How does that sort of fit with your
*  thesis here? Yes, I would not hold the filibuster up as an example of what I'm talking about.
*  So I share your view about the filibuster, but for a very specific reason that does, in fact,
*  align with my theory. So many people, when you ask somebody to define democracy, will start off by
*  saying, oh, it's majority rule. And that's not actually quite right. Democracy is about
*  equal empowerment across a body of free and equal citizens. And that is achieved through a
*  combination of tools. Majority rule is one of the most important tools, but you also need a variety
*  of minority protecting devices. So you need a whole kind of toolkit, but you have to be
*  balancing them over time. And the filibuster is an example of a mistaken use of minority
*  protecting mechanism. The mistake about it is to connect it to ordinary legislation.
*  And here there are literally sort of centuries of work on understanding what kind of vote should
*  be used under what conditions if you want to have effective functional government, that is,
*  doing reasonable processes of social discovery, pulling voices in from the different sides and
*  the like and synthesizing and so forth. And, you know, you use that 50% plus one threshold for
*  most things, for most ordinary contingent legislation where context change and
*  legislation needs to change and so forth. So super majority should be reserved for things
*  that rise to a constitutional level. So from my point of view, the filibuster is actually
*  a perfect example of the misapplication of a principle of minority protection.
*  So
*  you were a co-chair of this big bipartisan commission reinventing American democracy for
*  the 21st century. And that report is available freely on the internet. I really like it. I think
*  people should download it and look at the recommendations. But I wanted to talk about
*  the third section of that, if I'm remembering the numbering correctly here, which is to ensure the
*  responsiveness of government institutions. And I would say it's more about deliberative democracy.
*  It's more about ways you could have things like citizens assemblies and meetings and other ways
*  you could have a thicker kind of participation and advisory role for the public than you currently do.
*  Now, I think it's fair to say that the concern typically about deliberative democracy is it
*  doesn't scale very well. That you can have it in a New Hampshire town hall meeting. But when you're
*  talking about the number of issues we face nationally, when you're talking about how big
*  the country is, you just can't really make that work. But we also live in this world of new digital
*  tools. So maybe you can. So I'd like to hear you talk a bit about the recommendations of that
*  section of the report. You mentioned the Taiwan East example, which has shown up in a lot of
*  your work across different domains. How do you think about deliberative democracy? And how do
*  you think particularly about digital deliberative democracy and what that might enable?
*  So my original training, my original background is as a scholar of ancient Greece, right? So that
*  is kind of the example of deliberative democracy. The 30,000 citizens, white male citizens of ancient
*  Athens gathering in the assembly, some 6,000 of them usually showing up for an assembly
*  in a city that was 200, 250,000 population there across from the Acropolis with orators standing on
*  this big stone stage and in fact somehow managing to project across space through to the 6,000 people
*  who were there. So in that regard, you know, deliberative democracy, I have a soft space in
*  my heart for it for sure and always have. That said, I do think that representative institutions
*  are a powerful invention. And so I see the value of the deliberative sort of tools and techniques
*  that we have as things that can help us improve our existing structures of representation. So
*  by and large, our common purpose report also pursues that approach. That is to say,
*  we seek the sort of integration of these tools into existing structures of representation
*  rather than their replacement. So yes, I mean, the VTaiwan example, the use of a tool called Polis
*  is a good one. It's a tool that can surface the spread of opinion, help people see potential areas
*  of consensus and common agreement more rapidly. Members of Congress would benefit from access to
*  tools like this. They're sort of significantly improved beyond opinion polling, in other words.
*  One of the problems with opinion polling is precisely that it doesn't actually
*  provide any opportunity for reflection that is built on learning. One of the greatest
*  values of democracy is precisely that together we can in fact be much smarter than we can be
*  as individuals. So all the places in the report where we proposed integrating elements of deliberation,
*  whether that's participatory budgeting at the municipal level, whether that's having members
*  of Congress have access to deliberative assemblies and deliberative tools to improve their own
*  learning about what the issues are in our society. Those are really about improving that process of
*  social discovery where we learn together about the shape of the hardships that we're facing.
*  We see solutions that can emerge into visibility because of that collective work when we can't
*  actually get to them from any specific point of expertise or any single isolated position. So
*  that's really the picture. And so, I mean, you're asking a different kind of question really,
*  I think, which is about that experience of participation. And I think, you know, you're
*  asking both what makes us think that people are going to want it and, you know, why do we think
*  that it is valuable too beyond the sort of payoffs that I'm describing. I think we see a lot of
*  evidence that people want it where participatory budgeting is used around the world. People love
*  it. People enjoy it. People are really glad of the opportunity to help steer the direction of their
*  municipal budget or identify needs that are going otherwise unnoticed by their central administrative
*  bodies. So the reason we see a lot of people sort of feeling the drag of participation is because
*  right now it's really hard to participate. And it will always be hard in the sense of taking time
*  and a tax on time. But that's where I think, you know, we need an economy that supports that.
*  We need a workplace where we're not talking just about work-life balance, but we're talking about
*  work-life civic balance so that people have the time to participate. And then we actually need,
*  you know, non-opaque structures to participate in. We have a huge opacity problem, which is a real
*  tax on people's experience of the kind of creative joy of participation.
*  One of the things I think is interesting is how actually little innovation there is around
*  small-d democratic governance. It's like we, whatever we had 50 years ago, we're just
*  remixing that back and forth. I would like to go more deeply into an example, because honestly,
*  I think this can be a little airy. So could you talk in some detail about whichever one you think
*  is the best example for grounding this theory a little bit? What makes this kind of depth of
*  participation possible? What does it feel like? You mentioned being able to feel a little bit of
*  that joy of being in the process. What have you seen and how does it work when that occurs?
*  Well, this is not a fancy example. It doesn't draw on new technologies, although it did at the time.
*  But if you go back to the 07-08 Obama campaign, the first campaign, particularly in the primary,
*  what the Obama campaign did was produce all these sort of DIY kits. It was 07-08, so it was still
*  super early in the days of social media, and people were empowered to run their own community
*  groups, basically their own community organizing spaces. People learned how to organize. They
*  learned how to recruit other people into participation. They were empowered to use
*  the time and space to name the issues that mattered most to them. And at the end of the day,
*  I think that the Affordable Care Act came out of that, because across the country, people at a
*  grassroots level were figuring out that the thing that was hardest and worse than their life was the
*  health care system. Those conversations transformed people's lives. The number of people
*  who experienced that, who participated in that, who continue to be politically active today because
*  of that is really quite remarkable. That body of people, what they experienced with tools, put at
*  their hands that were empowering and that then yielded a process of social discovery, that yielded
*  a major social transformation, that realization that it's possible to do something that is
*  really important to people, that realization that it's possible has, as I said, motivated people to
*  continue participating. So as you know, lots of folks were then very disappointed in the Obama
*  administration that that basic aspect of the experience of participation didn't flow through
*  into the pattern of governance. But it is the case now that there are experiments all over the
*  country of people trying to do quite similar things. And now the resources really are amazing.
*  Yesterday, again here in Massachusetts, at a launch of a new tool called the Massachusetts
*  Platform for Legislative Engagement, and what this is is a combination of a bill tracking tool,
*  but also a tool that permits people to post testimony. And the purpose is to try to bring
*  into the light the sort of actual process of who's testifying on what bills, which voices are
*  legislators listening to and the like. We, as it happens in Massachusetts, we rank very low on
*  transparency scales. There are no sort of public records requirements for the legislature. It's
*  very hard to know who's testified on what bill at all and so forth. So there's a kind of community
*  of people that have formed around the work of creating this as a pure volunteer effort. And
*  now they're working to connect all the different sort of advocacy organizations in the state.
*  And as they do that work, I mean, what they find over and over again is there's a very profound
*  hunger for things that link clean information to the ability to see what's happening in
*  decision-making bodies and then contribute your voice to shaping that.
*  So about a year ago, maybe two years ago now, you were one of, I think it's six authors on a paper
*  called How AI Fails Us. And I think it's an interesting paper from this perspective,
*  because one of the main points you make there is that the way AI is being built, designed,
*  conceptualized and potentially implemented is very centralizing. There's a neat move in the paper
*  where you and your co-authors say, look, when they say they're solving the problem of intelligence,
*  if you really look at it, what they're trying to do is solve the problem of central planning.
*  They are trying to solve the problem of how you can have a system that plans effectively
*  without actually all that much input at all. So we are now in this era where AI is everywhere
*  and everybody's talking about it. And we do seem to be at this inflection point for how
*  it will develop and how it will be implemented. So can you talk a bit about what you were worried
*  about in that paper and what you've seen since? Sure. So the paper is really focused on some of
*  the core concepts that have governed a lot of AI development and AI thinking, even some of the
*  concepts that are a little bit more 30,000 foot or metaphorical. So for example, singularity. So
*  the idea that the goal is to achieve an intelligence that aligns with the sort of singularity of human
*  intelligence. And our sort of basic starting point is the recognition that human intelligence is plural
*  and human societies are pluralistic and human flourishing is at its most robust when that
*  pluralism and that plurality of forms of intelligence is supported. That as a species,
*  we maximize our capacity not by sort of resolving ourselves all into a singularity, a sort of
*  homogenizing force, but rather by activating and supporting the sort of full deployment of our
*  plurality. So the paper is sort of arguing for a different paradigm for technology development.
*  The idea that we could design to support and activate the many kinds of human intelligence
*  to support and activate healthy forms of human pluralism. And there are people who are experimenting
*  in this regard. There's a new Institute, the Plurality Institute, and it is a convening space
*  for technologists and academics who are trying things out. There are folks who are sort of
*  working to design technologies that help people bridge lines of division. So instead of rewarding
*  people for ever more outrageous things that reinforce division, you can really structure
*  different kinds of incentives into social media platforms and the like. So there are those kinds
*  of experiments going on right now. And in terms of the current moment, I mean, it's a really big
*  moment as you know, and as you've already written about in such important ways. So with the release
*  of GPT-4, right, we really are at a phase shift in terms of what the kind of capacity for these
*  tools is. And so things are moving very fast. There's just a real imperative for all of us to
*  do the work of figuring out what the sort of combination of societal norms, legal guardrails,
*  and the like should be for the use of these technologies. One of the things I was thinking
*  about when I was reading that paper is it's a very profound point that intelligence is collective,
*  it is relational, it is situational. And then I felt like you could also make an argument,
*  the particularly large language models being trained on the corpus of internet text,
*  that their vision of intelligence actually is very much collective, relational, pluralistic
*  in the sense that for good or for bad, whatever they know is this huge inhaling of everything
*  that not literally everybody but huge numbers of people have written have put out. And their
*  averaging is a little bit too simplistic of a way to put it, but they're drawing
*  connections, correlations, and trying to kind of predict what this collective would say next.
*  So in some ways, aren't these systems exactly what you're calling for?
*  I mean, yes, I think the large language models do have a kind of pluralistic construction for sure.
*  And not only that, but they can do things, they can embody forms of intelligence that are not
*  accessible to us. So in that regard, they are themselves already another yet different kind
*  of intelligence. So we have in that regard, yet another meaning of the kind of concept of
*  plural intelligences. So the question in some sense is really, given that they have that capacity,
*  can we help steer the direction of the development of technologies in ways that support
*  this good feature of human existence? Or will the capacities to accelerate the creation of
*  misinformation, to accelerate fraud, to destabilize institutions and things like that,
*  will that be what leads with these technologies? So that's where I can, we just are at a really
*  kind of critical moment for figuring out what the policy guardrails are. And it's just like
*  the invention of any other kind of game changing technology, gunpowder, nuclear power, or whatever.
*  I mean, it can do bad and it can do good. And so the question is, how long does it take us
*  as a world, as an entire globe to achieve the kind of conventions, structure and regulation
*  that ensure that this technology operates primarily in the direction of the good?
*  Pete Slauson One of the things I thought was an interesting
*  bringing together a lot of these ideas. So one of your co-authors on the paper, Divya Siddhartha,
*  she is now a co-leader of the Collective Intelligence Project, which you're an advisor to.
*  And I was speaking to her the other day and they're standing up these alignment assemblies.
*  They're trying to basically build a deliberative democracy platform on which people are going to
*  be able to come together using the tools that have been designed for participatory budgeting
*  and climate deliberative democracy and so on to try to develop senses of what people want in AI
*  governance and AI systems. They, I think, have some openings into the major companies right now
*  and are working with them a bit but have an ambition that this will eventually be used to
*  feed into things that are more publicly created standards. And I thought that was interesting
*  because, you know, one of the concerns about deliberative democracy is it doesn't scale that
*  well. But actually, the way AI is being created is incredibly narrow. I mean, by a couple of
*  companies and a couple of places, it actually seems like a quite promising space where you
*  could have, you know, citizen assemblies that do have a little bit more of a role in trying to
*  create a somewhat more legitimate sense of what people, you know, who go through a process on this
*  would want. I'm curious to hear your reflections as somebody sort of supporting that project.
*  Yes, I think Divya and Saffron's work building out the alignment assemblies is just one of the
*  most important things that's happening right now. So they are using digital tools to build citizen
*  assemblies. They are seeking to build a structure that will provide meaningful public input to key
*  steering decisions that the AI labs are making. The challenge, of course, is to figure out what
*  exactly does meaningful public impact mean in this kind of context. Got to make sure that you're
*  capturing perspectives from many different parts of the world. So there's a kind of necessary
*  element of scale in it. But of course, there's also a real imperative for speed. You know, we're all,
*  at this point, I guess, expecting chat GPT-5 by the end of this calendar year. And so things
*  are moving really fast. And we just don't actually really know what the impacts of these capabilities
*  are likely to be. So the kind of pressure is how do you design for speed and reasonable
*  scale to support legitimacy in the near term. But yes, I mean, and they can do this, right? They can
*  do this work and they can get meaningful public input in, in a way that governments at this moment
*  in time can't do, can't move fast enough to do. So that's what brings us back to the beginning of
*  the conversation. Yeah, when you were making the point about abundance progressives and their kind
*  of concern about the sort of lack of nimbleness that our current governing institutions have,
*  we're feeling the pressure and strain of that now, as we seek to grapple with the implications of
*  the really remarkable new models based on the large language learning models.
*  Pete Slauson One critique you could offer though of that project, which I think is a very common
*  critique made of deliberative democracy and more broadly, just democracy, but it maybe bites with
*  real force when you're talking about something like AI systems, is that what is the value of having
*  people without technical expertise weighing in and controlling things that are highly technical? I
*  mean, if the assembly comes up and says, hey, we want this to be legible and we want to be able
*  to know what the system is doing and the people say, who are making them say that's not really
*  possible, we don't know how to do that in these models. To do that is to basically break the whole
*  approach, you know, who's right and who's wrong there. I think there's always a suspicion that
*  to have deliberative democracy means you'll be having people who don't have enough expertise
*  to have well-founded opinions coming up with the works or maybe coming up with ideas that are really
*  bad and that has been an impediment to it and I think probably would be here too. So, how do you
*  think about that or how do you answer that? Danielle Pletka
*  Well, I think that is somewhat of a misconception honestly of sort of what deliberation can and
*  should do. So, I mean, the first job of deliberation is to establish the steering direction with regard
*  to basically values, like what do we actually care about here, what matters to us and why.
*  And that is something that you cannot use technocrats to do. That is exactly a human question
*  over and over again. It is the sort of the first human question. It is the human question that
*  roils politics, of course, but that's the thing that you need deliberative assemblies to address.
*  And so, if assemblies say we want to know what's going on and then technologists say, well, you
*  can't if we have systems of this kind, then there's a thing to negotiate, then that's the work to do.
*  What's the relationship then between that desire to know, that need to know,
*  and the fact that technology can't deliver it? Does that mean we try to call a halt to it? Does
*  that mean that we develop a different kind of bridge, etc.? So, the fact that there's a kind
*  of discrepancy between the values people may articulate and what technologists think they
*  can deliver is the beginning of the work, not the end of it.
*  Matthew 10 I think that is a good place to end this conversation though. So,
*  also our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience?
*  Well, there's the Melvin Rogers book that I am still failing to remember the precise title of,
*  so you'll have to say the title of it again.
*  Matthew 11 It is The Darkened Light of Faith.
*  Matthew 12 The Darkened Light of Faith, exactly. Thank you. So, Melvin Rogers, The Darkened Light
*  of Faith. And I'm sure you probably know Max Tegmark's Life 3.0. And third one,
*  Helene Landemore, Open Democracy.
*  Matthew 11 Danielle Allen, thank you very much.
*  Thanks, Ezra. Good to be with you.
*  Thank you.
