# Our Brains Werenâ€™t Designed for This Kind of Food
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [February 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KarmrN5-X4)
*  I'm Ezra Klein.
*  This is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Our society has long treated weight gain as a function of insufficient willpower.
*  If you're overweight, it's because you chose to be.
*  You ate too much or you didn't exercise enough.
*  You lack the virtue and the discipline of the thin.
*  This story is great.
*  It is great for punishing anyone who struggles with weight.
*  It is great for justifying discrimination and maltreatment.
*  But it is just nonsense if you take even a cursory look at the data.
*  And Stefan Guionet has looked, and I put this very lightly, a lot deeper than that.
*  Guionet is a neurobiologist by training.
*  He is obsessive about study interpretation and experimental design and methodology.
*  And his book, The Hungry Brain, is to me the most convincing model for why obesity is rising
*  year after year, why so many who try so hard to change their waistlines fail even after
*  they sometimes first succeed, and why our individualized narratives around this are
*  so cruel and also so wrong.
*  His argument, based on reams of evidence, is that weight gain is a product of this fundamental
*  mismatch between our brains, not just our waistlines or something, our brains, our genetics
*  and our social environment.
*  We live in a world where we are surrounded by endless varieties of cheap, convenient
*  food that is engineered to make us crave it.
*  And craving is not just about liking something.
*  It is often a signal the brain is getting that this is calorically dense.
*  This is the kind of thing that can keep you alive.
*  We have brains tuned for a world of food scarcity.
*  You can't understand any of this without understanding that.
*  Guionet's book came out in 2017, and in the past year or so we've seen the introduction
*  of new weight loss drugs that fit the hungry brain model perfectly.
*  These drugs, they don't work by making your body burn more calories.
*  They make your brain want less food.
*  As I wanted to have Guionet on, he's looked quite deeply at these drugs and how they work,
*  to talk through his model, to walk me through these drugs, and to think a bit about the
*  strange and complicated, almost ironic, it's like a Greek myth, world we're in.
*  One where having solved for many people the central problem of humankind up to this point,
*  how do we get enough to eat?
*  Many are now searching for drugs and therapies at great cost, at great expense, at great
*  difficulty to change our brains and biology so that we eat less.
*  As always, my email, ezraokindshow at mytimes.com.
*  Stefan Guionet, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks for having me, Ezra.
*  So the core argument of the book is that at the heart of our modern food system is this
*  mismatch between the way our brains are wired and the food and social environment we've
*  built.
*  Tell me about that mismatch.
*  So I think there's this common understanding of food intake and body fatness, which is
*  that people make conscious decisions about their eating and those conscious decisions
*  result in a certain calorie intake and they have a certain physical activity level and
*  the output of that determines their body fatness.
*  And so this is the kind of calories in, calories out reasoning and then if you want to lose
*  weight all you have to do is just stop eating so much and you lose weight and it's not a
*  problem.
*  However what we see is that it's not quite so easy because when you just tell people
*  to eat less they don't lose that much weight and what we see is that it's not really sustainable.
*  They can't lose weight to the extent that they would like to and so this suggests that
*  there is kind of this dichotomy happening between a conscious rational brain that wants
*  us to lose weight and be lean and eat less and be healthy and then this non-conscious
*  intuitive impulsive brain that is composed of these regulatory circuits that are responding
*  to our environment and are responding to our genetics and that are causing us to eat more.
*  And essentially when you take this non-conscious brain out of the context where it evolved,
*  where all of those impulses that it generates made a lot of sense and you put it into the
*  modern food environment where we're surrounded by easily accessible calorie dense highly
*  rewarding foods those same impulses pull us in the wrong direction and cause us to over
*  consume.
*  What is the difference between seeing these differences person to person as being about
*  willpower and seeing them as being at least partially about genetic susceptibility?
*  I think it's pretty hard to attribute something entirely to willpower when there are strong
*  genetic susceptibility factors.
*  It's like you look at height, height is highly genetic.
*  You look at body mass index, body fatness, it's highly genetic.
*  And this has been studied scientifically and the studies suggest that depending on the
*  method you look at somewhere between 40 and 80% of differences in body fatness are determined
*  by genetic differences.
*  And so genetics has a very strong influence on body fatness.
*  And certainly it relates to behaviors but you have to consider that our behaviors are
*  also genetically influenced.
*  Pretty much anything you look at, almost any human trait is genetically influenced.
*  And even things like willpower to the extent that they may contribute to body fatness are
*  also genetically influenced.
*  So I think it's a pretty complex conversation when, I mean, I don't think that we should
*  be drawing moral conclusions based on people's weight.
*  That's my position.
*  But I think even if you were to try to do that, it's a pretty complicated conversation
*  because of the fact that all of these things are genetically influenced.
*  But I think this is actually a profound conversation too.
*  And I want to hold on the height weight analogy there because the reason I think weight feels
*  different to people is it is related to behavior.
*  Whether or not you eat a third or fourth or fifth slice of pizza, whether or not you go
*  to the gym.
*  But your point that behavior is itself often an expression of genetic predisposition is
*  pretty profound.
*  So talk a bit about this argument that what is happening here is that you have genes expressing
*  themselves in the brain and the brain is in controlling behavior.
*  And we shouldn't understand that all as a matter of individual choice.
*  I think a good entry point into this is to consider where hunger comes from.
*  So when you get hungry at a certain time of day, let's say, is that because you chose
*  to feel hunger?
*  Or is that something that arises out of circuits in your non-conscious mind?
*  Or if you smell the smell of brownies or you walk past a bakery and you smell fresh baked
*  bread and suddenly you feel a desire to eat what you smelled.
*  Is that something that you chose?
*  Did you choose to suddenly develop this motivational response, this craving toward brownies or
*  pizza or whatever it is that you smelled?
*  No, these are things that arise from non-conscious brain regions.
*  And I think because they're non-conscious, it's not really intuitive to think about the
*  fact that our behavior is strongly influenced by these brain regions.
*  They're non-conscious so we can't directly observe them.
*  We can only indirectly observe their outputs.
*  But it turns out that these regions have a very strong impact on our behavior.
*  So if you think about someone's appetite, some people just have bigger appetites than
*  others.
*  Is that something they chose?
*  Of course not.
*  But the amount of calories that we eat, it can be influenced in many ways.
*  It's not just hunger that influences our calorie intake, but many of these influences on our
*  calorie intake such as our hunger and how susceptible we are to food cues related to
*  highly rewarding foods such as smelling a brownie.
*  Those are not things that we're choosing.
*  Those are things that are being generated by non-conscious brain circuits that are influenced
*  both by genetics and by our prior experience like our upbringing and our environment.
*  This puts me in mind of a conversation I had years ago with a friend.
*  We were out at lunch together and we weren't talking about food, but there were chips on
*  the table.
*  He said as way of an analogy to something else, and I forget what he was actually talking
*  about because I think he actually said was so astonishing to me, but he said as way of
*  analogy to something else that doing or not doing that thing was as trivial and unthinking
*  for him as not eating all the chips in the bowl.
*  I remember saying, well, what do you mean by that?
*  It's an enormous constant act of willpower to not eat all the chips in the bowl.
*  55% of my brain, this whole conversation has been on what is a socially acceptable number
*  of chips and how much can I push the boundary on that.
*  I had this moment as we talked about this that I realized he just had a completely different
*  experience of moving through the world and being around food than I did.
*  It just wasn't this kind of thinking and obsessing and pushing and troubled control.
*  I want to hold on this for a minute because I think it's important both to your book and
*  a lot of what we're going to talk about here.
*  When you say a lot affects how people act beyond just hunger cues, what do we actually
*  know about that?
*  What is the difference in the subjective experience of somebody susceptible to eating a lot, overeating,
*  weight gain, whatever it might be, when they're sitting near foods that appeal to them versus
*  somebody who does not have some of these same genetic proclivities?
*  I would say that we don't have a lot of great, really concrete information that gives us
*  the whole causal chain from the common genetic variants all the way through to behavior.
*  However, there are things that have been identified that differ between people who are more susceptible
*  to over consumption and weight gain and people who are not.
*  One of the things that has been identified is that certain people just have a much stronger
*  motivational response to seductive food.
*  If you have chips sitting in front of you on the table, that's one example of it.
*  Leonard Epstein has done a lot of this research where they can actually quantify how hard
*  people are willing to work for food.
*  They'll give people a snack so they're not really hungry and then they'll have them play
*  these video games where you have to give a certain number of responses and the number
*  of responses you have to give goes up and up and up each time you receive a reward,
*  which is like a little piece of candy bar or some soda or something like that.
*  Then you can compare that to non-food reward like a magazine or a little video game or
*  something.
*  How motivated are people for this seductive food relative to a non-food reward?
*  That is an individual trait that varies greatly between individuals.
*  You will see that some people will work really hard for a little piece of candy bar or for
*  a sip of soda, whereas some people really will not work very hard.
*  Once the response requirement starts to increase, they just kind of give up, they don't care
*  anymore.
*  And so there's this trait of food reward responsiveness, you could say, or the technical term is relative
*  reinforcing value of food.
*  And that describes exactly the scenario that you're talking about with the difference between
*  you and your friend.
*  You've been talking here about the differences between individuals, but I want to talk about
*  something that's go to your book, which is the similarities and in particular the sort
*  of evolutionary environment in which our brains response to different kinds of food emerged,
*  which was an environment much more food scarcity.
*  So tell me a bit about the world our minds believe we are living in and are prepared
*  for.
*  So the human brain is very flexible, so it can adapt to a variety of different environments,
*  of course, but at the same time, we do have hardwired inclinations.
*  The human brain is not infinitely flexible.
*  And the situation we're in right now is radically different than the range of situations that
*  humans evolved in in terms of our relationship with food.
*  So if you look at hunter gatherers, humans were hunter gatherers for something like 99.5%
*  of our evolutionary history since the development of the genus Homo.
*  And if you look at cultures today, historic and current cultures that are living a hunter
*  gatherer lifestyle, what you see is they're having to work really hard to get their food.
*  And there are periods where they don't necessarily get the quantity or the quality of food that
*  they would like.
*  And so I think it's radically different in terms of the convenience of the food.
*  You know, if you think about if people had to walk five miles and climb a tree to get
*  the food that they eat every time they wanted to eat, that would be a pretty powerful disincentive
*  for people to be eating as much as we typically do, even if the food was the same.
*  But at the same time, their food was also quite different.
*  The food, of course, that hunter gatherers eat is basically whatever they can get from
*  the environment.
*  And usually that's a mix of plant and animal foods.
*  Usually they have very little ability to process and refine those foods.
*  Now, humans process food.
*  That's one of our characteristics.
*  So it's not like they didn't process food at all.
*  So they cooked things.
*  You know, that's the main processing method.
*  They would cut things up, cuts of meat and pound things to soften them and stuff like
*  that.
*  But there was not this ability to refine and recombine ingredients like we do in the modern
*  world.
*  And particularly, I think a thing that's really key is over the course of human history, we've
*  gained through technology and affluence, we've gained the ability to separate out and purify
*  the active ingredients in food that mediate their seductiveness, the ingredients in food
*  that cause dopamine release in the brain.
*  And so we basically have these purified, almost drug-like ingredients that we can concentrate
*  and recombine to create things that are more motivating for our brains than a hunter-gatherer
*  would typically experience.
*  Well, we'll talk through what makes a food particularly motivating to the brain.
*  What are the signals and what is the brain taking from those signals?
*  So the main ones that have been identified so far, either identified or strongly suspected,
*  are carbohydrate, both starch and sugar, fat, protein, and salt, and umami, or glutamate,
*  that kind of meaty flavor that's in cooked meat and bone broth and soy sauce and fish
*  sauce.
*  Those are food properties that are reinforcing, which means that they stimulate and strengthen
*  behavior.
*  They stimulate repeat behavior and strengthen behavior.
*  The brain basically learns, brain wants them and learns how to acquire them and how to
*  generate motivational responses around them.
*  And particularly, the more those are concentrated and combined, concentrated up to a point,
*  there's kind of what's called a bliss point of maximum seductiveness.
*  To the extent that they are concentrated and combined, they stimulate our motivational
*  drive, which is mediated by dopamine release in the brain.
*  So essentially, you eat foods that contain these substances, dopamine spikes in your
*  brain, that generates a motivational response, and it generates learning that makes you more
*  motivated in the future.
*  It's a natural, healthy process normally.
*  This is what's supposed to happen when you eat food.
*  This is the process that guided our ancestors to the foods that supported them and allowed
*  them to survive and reproduce.
*  However, when you purify out the ingredients that spike dopamine, you purify it away from
*  the water and the fiber and maybe some of the less desirable flavors that would be in
*  a unrefined food, then suddenly you are concentrating the dopamine stimulating properties of that
*  food and accentuating the seductiveness of it far beyond the foods that our distant ancestors
*  would have experienced.
*  And just to draw this out, the basic thing that the brain is trying to pick up on here
*  is that these flavors are signals of caloric density.
*  Yeah, yeah, I appreciate you mentioning that.
*  Yeah, so that is one of the main points here is that aside from the salt, all of those
*  other properties I mentioned are properties that correlate with the energy content of
*  the food.
*  So if we look at how the brain is set up, the signals that it responds to, the signals
*  that trigger a motivational response, they revolve quite a bit around calories, around
*  acquiring calories.
*  So that is how we are wired and that suggests that calorie intake, like learning which foods
*  are the most calorie dense, was a very important thing for the survival and reproduction of
*  our ancestors.
*  So it was good for them to have a high level of motivation for calorie dense foods.
*  That is how our brain is wired, but unfortunately today it is just a little too easy to get
*  those foods and so that for many of us becomes counterproductive.
*  You give this interesting analogy in the book between the way we refine cocaine from the
*  coca leaf and the way we refine chocolate out of the cocoa bean that I just find to
*  be provocative as an analogy, but also interesting as a way to think about the process here.
*  Can you talk through that?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  So the coca plant is a plant that contains a low concentration of this substance, cocaine,
*  and it has been chewed by indigenous South American cultures for thousands of years as
*  a mild stimulant.
*  It is kind of like drinking a cup of coffee.
*  You chew coca leaves.
*  In that context, it is a perfectly constructive habit to have, just like drinking coffee.
*  It's a pretty benign indulgence.
*  However, if you then take that leaf and you refine out the cocaine, you're taking the
*  active ingredient out of that leaf.
*  By the way, cocaine is an inhibitor of dopamine reuptake at the synapse in the brain, which
*  means that it increases dopamine levels.
*  That's how cocaine works.
*  And so you're taking out the active dopamine stimulating ingredient and you're concentrating
*  it many fold.
*  And now you've taken something that was a mild stimulant and you've turned it into
*  a strong stimulant that's highly reinforcing that spikes dopamine to very high levels and
*  can create addiction because of that.
*  So you're purifying out the dopamine stimulating element and the more you spike dopamine, the
*  closer we get to addiction.
*  And if we then take that cocaine and we free base it, which basically means that now it
*  can freely cross lipid membranes and get into the brain really easily, now it has faster
*  kinetics when you take it and that's crack cocaine and that's even more addictive.
*  So essentially each processing step has enhanced the active ingredient, concentrated and enhanced
*  the active ingredient in the coca leaf, cocaine, and turned it from a benign indulgence and
*  a useful substance into a life destroying, potentially life destroying drug, addictive
*  drug.
*  And so over the course of human history, the analogy here is that we have developed the
*  ability to identify and purify the dopamine stimulating nutrients in food as well.
*  And so there's a lot of debate over whether we can call food addictive or not per se,
*  use that word per se.
*  So I think, you know, I just want to acknowledge that not everyone in the research community
*  agrees that we can really call food addictive.
*  However, it remains true whether we call it addictive or not, that we have concentrated
*  the dopamine stimulating properties and made that food a lot more seductive than what
*  our ancestors would have experienced and what our brains are accustomed to.
*  And so if we look at chocolate, chocolate has properties that stimulate a lot of dopamine.
*  So first of all, it's very high in fat, very high in calorie density.
*  Once you add sugar to it, it also has carbohydrate and that combination of fat and carbohydrate
*  is particularly stimulating to our reward circuits.
*  And that alone would make a highly rewarding food.
*  But chocolate has something else in it that really takes it to the next level.
*  And that is a habit forming drug called theobromine.
*  Theobromine is pretty much like caffeine, very similar to caffeine.
*  So on its own, it's not highly habit forming.
*  You know, it's like caffeine.
*  But when you combine that ability to stimulate that dopamine signaling pathway with the concentrated
*  nutrients that are in the chocolate, you get a really powerful response.
*  And what we see is that chocolate is actually the most craved food.
*  If you just do surveys of what foods people crave the most, what foods people lose control
*  around the most, chocolate is number one, particularly for women, but it's very high
*  on the list for men as well.
*  Well, to further the, I don't exactly want to say the addiction analogy, but I always
*  think of addiction as a pretty broad spectrum of human behavior.
*  And it's at least useful as a sort of cognitive label.
*  Because it connects to something important in this conversation, which is not only that
*  I don't think we want to admit it being a widespread problem, but that it has then implications
*  which we very much don't want to face up to.
*  So with things we have classified as problematically addicting, to varying extents, we have quite
*  a bit of prohibition on at least the legal acquisition of more and more purified experimental
*  versions of them.
*  So we have, I mean, people argue about whether or not we have enough rules on alcohol, but
*  you're not in most states supposed to drink until 21, and you can't drive after you drink
*  and so on and so forth.
*  We have become extremely prohibitionist around cigarettes in terms of the social consequences
*  of smoking in terms of where you can smoke.
*  I remember being in DC when the smoking ban was passed, you'd be in bars before that and
*  it would be like being inside somebody's lung and all of a sudden you couldn't and you'd
*  have to be outside in the cold.
*  A lot of drugs that are extremely rewarding, cocaine we talked about, they are illegal
*  to use, except in very, very unusual circumstances.
*  It's not just that obviously it's illegal, but it's a multi, multi, multi-billion dollar
*  industry to figure out how to make it even and ever more distilled such that it is that
*  much more rewarding.
*  I mean, you think of the money and branding efforts that went into making tacos made out
*  of Doritos a couple of years ago when that was a big deal, or the amount that goes into
*  perfecting a McDonald's meal or whatever it might be.
*  We really do, I think, keep getting better at this.
*  I have extremely, extremely low patience for people who want to pretend that all this
*  food research doesn't work to make things that are tasty.
*  It really quite clearly does.
*  And as such, you really have this, again, maybe a mismatch is right language for it
*  between brains and particularly for individuals who are susceptible to this, between how palatable
*  we find these foods and then a gigantic industry that has a lot of really remarkable brain
*  power and money to say nothing of marketing going in to trying to find the exact food
*  that we will find most palatable and habit forming and getting us to buy it really quite
*  often all the way down to when we're little kids and are seeing Paw Patrol on the cereal
*  boxes as we walk through the aisle.
*  There's just a tremendous corporate world here that is trying to work with as part of
*  our psychology, physiology.
*  And I think that is sustained, that is only safe so long as it doesn't get categorized
*  in this place where when we've categorized other things that way, the regulatory hammer
*  has come down.
*  Yeah, it's a striking contrast.
*  I agree.
*  And I think at the same time, I want to acknowledge that having strong motivational drives toward
*  food or perhaps we could call it addiction in some people is not the same as alcoholism,
*  it's not the same as being addicted to crack cocaine or meth, I mean, I think, or even
*  cigarettes, you know.
*  It's important to acknowledge that these habits are not equivalent in terms of their impacts
*  on people's lives and on society.
*  So I think that's part of it.
*  Foodie is something that accumulates over many years and yes, it's bad for your health,
*  but it's not as bad as doing meth.
*  And the other thing is it's a much bigger, more amorphous problem, you know, like targeting
*  meth, like there's a real clear target there.
*  With food, it's just a lot murkier.
*  Some of the most interesting studies in the book to me were the ones that put people on
*  studies where in manipulating the environment manipulates the hunger cues.
*  So the first thing I'll say is that appetite is a regulated quantity, regulated by the
*  brain.
*  Body fatness is also a regulated quantity by the brain.
*  And appetite is the primary effector arm of the body fat regulating system.
*  So appetite is the primary thing that goes up or down in order to regulate your body
*  fatness.
*  It's the primary lever you can think of for influencing body fatness in humans.
*  So in the 1970s, a researcher named Anthony Sclafani had a sort of chance observation.
*  He was trying to develop obesity models in rats.
*  There was obesity in the 1970s.
*  Researchers were trying to study it.
*  And it was kind of the early days of figuring out how do you fatten a rat and how do you
*  do so quickly and efficiently so that you can have a graduate student study obesity
*  in your lab.
*  And at the time, they were adding fat to rat chow, and that was effective to some extent,
*  but took too long.
*  It wasn't reliable enough.
*  But one day, Anthony Sclafani saw a rat that was placed on his lab bench, saw it walk over
*  to a bowl of Froot Loops and start eating them.
*  And just kind of gorged on these Froot Loops.
*  And first of all, a rat these days would never be on a lab bench like that because we have
*  these really sophisticated facilities that exclude pathogens.
*  So this was really the old days.
*  But second of all, rats, they have something called neophobia, where they usually are very
*  cautious about new foods.
*  But this rat, as soon as it tasted the Froot Loops, it just kind of went crazy on him.
*  So he saw this and said, well, maybe we should try something else to make these rats fat.
*  Instead of just manipulating the macronutrients, instead of just adding fat, let's feed them
*  tasty human foods.
*  And so he went to the grocery store and he bought a variety of tasty human foods like
*  sausages and cookies and fries and things like that, and put them in the rat's cage.
*  And what happened was that the rats over consumed dramatically.
*  Their calorie intake went way up.
*  Their body weight went way up.
*  And there was not really anything you could do to stop this.
*  So first of all, they continued to have access to the healthy lower calorie food, but they
*  basically ignored it.
*  If you have access to salami and chocolate chip cookies, you're probably not going to
*  be worried about this bowl of whole grains over here.
*  And so physical activity attenuated the fat gain but did not prevent it.
*  An enriched environment, so giving the animals lots of stuff to do, didn't have any impact
*  on it.
*  So basically, he discovered this method of fattening rats that was much more effective
*  than any nutritional intervention that you could do to its pellets, any way of modifying
*  the nutrient content, way more effective than that.
*  And it happened to be tasty human food.
*  And it turns out that basically any animal that can develop obesity will develop obesity
*  when they are exposed to a wide variety, easy access, unlimited amount of tasty human
*  food.
*  And this same phenomenon has been observed in humans.
*  So Eric Rabison's, by the way, this was called the cafeteria diet.
*  That's kind of what they named it in the rodent research world.
*  And Eric Rabison, back in the 90s, did a series of experiments that were basically the equivalent
*  in humans.
*  He locked people up in a research facility with a wide variety of tasty human foods in
*  very easy access.
*  And in this situation, people dramatically over consumed calories.
*  And nobody was being asked to do so.
*  The rats weren't being asked to over consume.
*  The humans were not being asked to over consume.
*  This was just a natural outflow of the environment that they were placed in, the environment
*  and the foods.
*  And then we have more recent studies that have been done by Kevin Hall's group where
*  they give people access to, in a very controlled environment, in a laboratory environment,
*  they give people a diet of unrefined foods or a diet of ultra processed foods.
*  These are the kind of industrially processed, highly processed foods that many people might
*  call junk foods.
*  And what you see is a dramatic divergence in calorie intake in these experiments.
*  People will eat 500 more calories a day, roughly, of ultra processed food than of unrefined
*  food.
*  And again, nobody was being instructed to eat any particular amount of calories.
*  This is purely the brain's intuitive, instinctive response to the food that is being provided.
*  Tell me about what researchers call sensory-specific satiety.
*  So sensory-specific satiety is the observation that we can basically get full on a particular
*  type of food, like a food with a particular sensory quality, like savory or sweet, and
*  not necessarily be full for different foods with different sensory qualities.
*  And so you can give people a particular food, let them eat as much as they want.
*  They might be full on that food.
*  They have no desire to eat any more of that particular food.
*  But you give them a different type of food and they'll be prepared to eat possibly several
*  hundred calories of additional food from that or other foods.
*  And so this explains why we tend to eat so much at buffets, because we have so many different
*  sensory experiences to choose from.
*  And people tend to over consume dramatically in that situation.
*  You can see the same thing in rodent studies.
*  If you give rodents one tasty food, like chocolate chip cookies, in addition to their normal
*  food, they will eat more and gain weight.
*  If you give them three tasty foods at the same time, they will gain even more weight.
*  And so the variety of food seems to have a pretty substantial impact on our intake and
*  ultimately possibly on our weight.
*  I think another thing that is interesting to note is that this also goes a long way
*  toward explaining why we eat dessert.
*  You can have a savory meal.
*  Let's say you have fish and potatoes and a salad.
*  You can be completely done with those savory foods, not interested in eating any more of
*  those savory foods.
*  If somebody brought another potato out, you're not going to eat it.
*  But as soon as there's ice cream or cake or a brownie or something like that, you might
*  be prepared to eat hundreds of extra calories.
*  Part of that is due to sensory-specific satiety.
*  Part of it is due to the high reward value of those dessert items.
*  One stat from the book that speaks to this variety, I think in a kind of astonishing
*  way was you said in a report from the Food Marketing Institute that found the average
*  US grocery store contained around 15,000 items in 1980, which is great, a lot of items, and
*  has about 44,000 in the present.
*  This is a couple years old, so it might be higher than that now.
*  It really, I mean, I know people know this on some level, we all know this, but the variety
*  is totally astonishing that we have access to, not just the variety, but the convenience.
*  I mean, I remember a study that influenced me a lot back when I used to cover food and
*  health policy more closely is by, I want to say it was David Cutler and some co-authors.
*  And they really found that people weren't eating that much more in meals.
*  What they were doing was eating much more during snacking periods.
*  That accounted for a lot of weight gain over time.
*  And that in part, that was just because it had become easy to have a variety of foods
*  around you in between meals.
*  Nobody had to put any effort into cooking them or changing them.
*  We had preservation, we had refrigeration, we had vending machines in the modern era.
*  And as such, it's not just that variety exists, but variety exists across time now.
*  There might have been variety at dinner in 1950 or 1930, but it was harder to get that
*  same variety at 3 p.m. or at 11 a.m.
*  But now it's not just a lot of foods, but a lot of foods that are available to you at
*  all times.
*  You know, your workplace may be, if you work in a tech company or some kinds of companies
*  now has a kitchen with all kinds of stuff around for you all the time, that it's really
*  the food environment is unbelievably dramatically different.
*  Absolutely.
*  And I wish I had highlighted that stat about increases in snacking in my book, because
*  I think that's actually one of the most compelling correlates of the so-called obesity epidemic,
*  which is in the U.S. the increase in obesity prevalence since about 1980.
*  What you see is that the number of snacking occasions has increased quite a bit.
*  And it really correlates with that period where obesity rates started to rise rapidly.
*  And by the way, I'm using the word snacking loosely because this includes between meals,
*  sugar, sweet and beverages.
*  So, you know, solid foods as well as beverages, both of those things increased.
*  And if you look at the number of calories that's supplied by these additional snacking
*  that we didn't have in the 1970s, it's actually single-handedly able to explain our increase
*  in calorie intake over the course of the obesity epidemic.
*  So then let me ask about a study all the way on the other side of the spectrum, which is
*  from the 1960s, in which participants were only given bland liquid food from a straw.
*  What happened there?
*  Yeah.
*  So this was an interesting experiment with, I think for the investigators, really unexpected
*  results.
*  So there was a research team that was trying to understand what happens when you eliminate
*  basically all of the normal food cues that we would experience at a meal.
*  You know, eating it's complicated and it's influenced by many different variables, number
*  of people who are there, the types of food, all of your habits, the time of day.
*  And they were trying to say, like, if we strip all of that away and we, you know, what is
*  food intake going to look like?
*  And so they had people in this hospitalized setting where they could control their food
*  intake completely.
*  And they gave them access to this bland liquid diet.
*  And essentially what people had to do was press a button on this machine that dispensed
*  7.4 milliliters of this bland liquid diet directly into their mouth every time they
*  pressed the button.
*  And you could press the button as many times as you wanted per day.
*  And you were not instructed on how much you should be eating.
*  And they just left people to their own devices to see, you know, what their eating behavior
*  would be like.
*  And what they saw was that in lean people, lean people basically maintained their normal
*  calorie intake on this setup.
*  So their calorie intake really didn't change at all.
*  And their weight didn't change.
*  However, when they did the same thing in people with obesity, what they saw is that their
*  calorie intake plummeted.
*  So they went from eating, you know, probably 27, 3000 calories per day down to like a few
*  hundred calories a day.
*  And again, they were not asked to restrict their food intake.
*  This was the instinctive, intuitive output of their own brain.
*  This was how much their brain was driving them to eat.
*  And it was a strikingly small amount once you strip away all of the food cues, all the
*  food reward, all the food cues.
*  And they had people on this regimen for weeks and they were maintaining this very low calorie
*  intake and losing weight at a rapid rate.
*  There was one person who actually maintained it for a year and lost, if I'm recalling correctly,
*  half his body weight.
*  So yeah, it's just an interesting illustration of the impact that all of these food properties
*  have on these non-conscious circuits that impact our calorie intake.
*  So it's interesting and weird that I think it's kind of intuitive and also misleading.
*  And this gets then to the other side of this because I think you could listen to some of
*  the studies we just spoke about and say, okay, we've solved it.
*  Just put people on a bland diet for six or eight or 12 or 24 weeks, lose a bunch of weight
*  and we'll be good here.
*  But then there was these other regulatory systems.
*  So tell me a bit about the body's set point.
*  So the first concept to understand is that there is a regulatory system for body fat
*  in the brain.
*  And it's in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus that specializes in what's called
*  homeostatic regulation.
*  And so that means keeping certain quantities in the body within a particular desired range.
*  So for example, there is a thermostat in your brain that regulates your body temperature.
*  So that's one of the things that is regulated homeostatically in a manner that's analogous
*  to how your home thermostat regulates the temperature in your home.
*  And similarly, there is a system for regulating body fatness that some, including me, call
*  the lipostat.
*  So lipo is fat and stat is the same.
*  And this system responds to a variety of signals.
*  Some of the signals it responds to have actually been uncovered since I wrote my book.
*  But the main one, the most powerful one that it responds to is a hormone called leptin
*  that is secreted by fat tissue.
*  And the way leptin works is that it is secreted by fat tissue in proportion to its mass.
*  So the more fat you have, the more leptin you have in circulation.
*  And that is a key signal that the brain uses to measure the amount of fat your body has
*  and to determine whether that is an appropriate amount of fat.
*  So essentially, your hypothalamus has an idea of how much fat it wants you to have and it
*  compares your circulating leptin level to that idea.
*  So that idea is the set point, that term that you mentioned, or defended level of body fat.
*  Just like we have a defended level of body temperature, we have a defended level of body
*  fat that the hypothalamus prefers not to depart from.
*  And this system, I want to note that it's asymmetric in that it's a lot better at protecting
*  against weight loss.
*  I guess I should put protecting in air quotes.
*  It's a lot better at protecting against weight loss than it is at protecting against weight
*  gain.
*  Obviously, people tend to gain weight over the course of their lives.
*  But what we see is that the set point tends to creep up as people gain weight.
*  So it's like, it's not just that people are gaining weight, it's that the heavier weight
*  is the new normal, the new defended level for the brain.
*  It's the new set point.
*  And the way we know that is that when you put people on a weight loss diet, you tend
*  to see rebound.
*  So a person, just to give you an example to highlight this, if you have two people at
*  the same body mass index, the same body fatness, let's say BMI of 25, one of them used to have
*  obesity and dieted down through calorie restriction to that level.
*  The other person has always been at that level and that's their comfortable weight.
*  Then if you follow those two people up for the next few years, you're going to see that
*  the person who previously lost weight is much more susceptible to weight gain than the person
*  who has always been at that weight.
*  So those two people are not the same physiologically.
*  One of them is below their set point and their brain is fighting to regain that fat.
*  And so this is a key reason why weight loss is difficult.
*  Your brain, once the body fat starts to decline and the leptin starts to decline, your brain
*  detects that and initiates what I call a starvation response, which I believe that phrase is literally
*  accurate.
*  And that engages a suite of behavioral and physiological responses that are intended
*  to increase your calorie intake and sometimes curtail your metabolic rate in order to get
*  fat back into that fat tissue and bring you back to the set point, the place where your
*  brain instinctively prefers you to be.
*  You have a nice analogy on this where you say, imagine someone turning up the temperature
*  on the thermostat in your house by 10 degrees and you try to cool the house down by opening
*  the windows, but the thermostat reacts by turning on the furnace.
*  So even with the windows open, you're still hotter than you'd rather be.
*  You're struggling against regulatory system.
*  And then my colleague, Rajay Karanbaugh, I thought had a nice addition to this.
*  It's really like a thermostat with a broken AC system.
*  Because on the one hand, if you go low, it'll turn on the heat to try to get you higher
*  again.
*  If you lose 15 or 20 or 25 or 30 pounds, or in this analogy, go down that many degrees,
*  the heat turns on and you really, really have to fight it.
*  Whereas if you go up by that much, the AC doesn't turn on.
*  Nothing happens or much less happens, maybe I should say, to bring you back down.
*  So it's a very frustrating reality.
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  And I think that highlights this evolutionary mismatch that this system was not designed
*  for the modern environment.
*  It wasn't designed for the challenges that we face today.
*  I do want to say though that the AC does work for some people.
*  So you can see this in overfeeding trials where they have people in a controlled environment
*  eating a specific number of excess calories.
*  Some people gain a lot more fat than others in that scenario.
*  And that resistance to fat gain is something that has a tremendous amount of individual
*  variability.
*  And so I think some people do have good AC.
*  Maybe people's AC gets weaker and weaker with age.
*  I think that would be a compelling hypothesis to test.
*  But I think also how good your AC is, is one of the things that determines whether a person
*  is susceptible to obesity or not.
*  That's a very good addition to that.
*  Tell me about The Biggest Loser study.
*  Yeah, so this is a really interesting one.
*  So I think probably listeners will be familiar with the show, The Biggest Loser.
*  They are going through this extreme diet and physical activity intervention in order to
*  try to lose a large amount of weight very quickly.
*  And it's a high pressure competitive environment.
*  And people do lose a lot of weight.
*  So it's not uncommon for people to lose more than 100 pounds.
*  But what you see is that if you follow up with those people after the show, they tend
*  to regain a lot of that weight.
*  And this is typical.
*  This is what we see in weight loss trials as well.
*  To take the big picture on it, this study, like many, many other studies, although this
*  was a very extreme version because of The Biggest Loser's extreme nature as a project,
*  it shows that even when people do do this hard thing of successfully losing weight,
*  the proportion to keep it off over five years, let's call it, is fairly low.
*  And yet sometimes I'll read or listen to work on this and hear people describe it.
*  And there does have a tendency to be a...
*  Like who are you going to believe?
*  Like all these studies are your lying eyes?
*  Because we all do know people who have lost weight and kept it off for long periods of
*  time who have changed their bodies quite dramatically.
*  And so how do you think about the sort of unbelievable pessimism that I think has begun
*  to be dominant in the way we talk about this?
*  And in some of these studies, you know, you hear things like 95% of all diets fail, that
*  kind of thing.
*  But also the reality that people do lose weight, they do in many cases or in some cases keep
*  that weight off.
*  What's going on there for them?
*  I think there is a lot of pessimism and I think some of that is justified.
*  You know, we have these randomized controlled trials, which is a gold standard for determining
*  cause and effect in domains of health and nutrition.
*  And these trials are suggesting that if you put people on a diet and lifestyle weight
*  loss program, you know, if your program is good, maybe they'll lose something like 5-7%
*  of body weight.
*  And then over the next few years on average, even if they're trying to maintain that loss,
*  they will tend to regain most of that weight.
*  And so, you know, that's the reality of the situation.
*  But it's absolutely true that there are people who can lose a lot of weight and maintain
*  that.
*  But the problem is, you know, when we look around us and we see individual examples of
*  people who are losing a lot of weight and maintaining it, you know, that's very susceptible
*  to bias because we don't see all the people who tried to lose weight and weren't able
*  to do it successfully.
*  And I think there are a lot of those people.
*  In fact, if you look at the statistics from the Centers for Disease Control, they do surveys
*  on obesity prevalence and what kind of weight loss behaviors people are engaging in.
*  And you can see that two-thirds of people with obesity each year engage in some sort
*  of weight loss effort in the United States.
*  So people with obesity, most of them are actively trying to lose weight every year and not succeeding.
*  So I think it's really easy to get confirmation bias.
*  And I think that is something that makes us think that weight loss approaches are better
*  than they are.
*  Like when you're looking at, you know, whatever the diet is you're interested in, you go on
*  their website, they're going to be highlighting the success stories of Suzy who lost 100 pounds
*  and kept it off for a million years.
*  But that's not typical results.
*  That's just the best results.
*  So before we talk about some of the new treatments, given that I agree with you that that is extremely
*  clear that diet and exercise are not reliable for the vast majority of people in over any
*  kind of significant period of time.
*  There's a question of should we worry about this at all?
*  There are arguments about whether or not obesity really does have that much of an effect on
*  health, whether or not some of that is simply bias or improperly understood studies.
*  How do you understand at this point the relationship between obesity and health?
*  Yeah, I think there is a very strong relationship between body fatness and health.
*  And I think that relationship is causal.
*  I think if you have a large amount of excess body fat that is going to contribute to an
*  metabolic milieu in your body that is going to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and
*  cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancers and a wide variety of other conditions that
*  we don't want to have.
*  In fact, I think that now that cigarette smoking is receding in the United States and infectious
*  diseases are not as much of a problem as they were 100 years ago, I think physiological
*  energy excess, having too much energy in the body, I would say is probably the number
*  one cause of health problems in the United States at this time.
*  Too much energy in the body being too much excess stored fat.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's a little bit more complicated than that.
*  So really what it is is excess energy exposure to lean tissues.
*  And that is related to the amount of body fat you have.
*  A lot of it relates to your body fat's capacity as well.
*  So if you have the ability to store and sequester, because fat tissue is the body's professional
*  fat storage organ, right?
*  That's where fat is supposed to be in your body.
*  But once you get too much fat in your fat cells and they lose the ability to effectively
*  sequester it, now you've got a lot of spillover going on to tissues that can't handle it constructively.
*  And that's really where you're going to start getting insulin resistance, the type 2 diabetes,
*  the cardiovascular disease.
*  You're going to get fat in your liver.
*  You're going to get in your muscle and your pancreas.
*  That's where you're going to start seeing the more serious metabolic consequences.
*  Depending on the individual, that can happen at different amounts of body fat.
*  Doesn't necessarily take a lot.
*  So there's been a lot of debate about this.
*  And I want to acknowledge that there's a spectrum of opinions in the scientific community about
*  the relationship between body fatness and health.
*  But I think it seems pretty clear to me that there is a strong relationship.
*  And we could get into the methodological details of why I think that.
*  I don't want to get too...
*  Well, let me get into one dimension, Mitch, just because I want to make sure this perspective
*  is heard, which is that we have a lot of observational studies here.
*  There's often a sense that it's very hard to untangle obesity from other things like
*  lack of exercise, discrimination in medical care, poverty, right?
*  There's a lot of correlation between socioeconomic conditions and obesity, but that also then
*  correlates to bad sleep.
*  It correlates to stress.
*  It correlates to a bunch of other things.
*  And so there's one argument I have heard made quite a bit, is that there's an over attribution
*  of negative health consequences to obesity, which frames fat itself or excess fat storage
*  or exposure to lean tissue or whatever, as the causal mechanism when it's actually downstream
*  of the causal mechanisms.
*  How do you think about that?
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure that that's true to a certain extent.
*  Observational studies, there's a million things that could potentially confound them.
*  And I'm certain that what you said is part of the story.
*  However, we have intervention studies.
*  We don't have to just rely on observational studies.
*  We have intervention studies in humans.
*  We have intervention studies in animals.
*  These are best developed in the case of type 2 diabetes.
*  So type 2 diabetes risk is exquisitely sensitive to body fatness.
*  We have a number of huge randomized controlled trials in humans showing that if you take
*  people with pre-diabetes, so they have metabolic disturbances suggesting that they're at a
*  high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, you put them on a weight loss diet, you can dramatically
*  reduce their risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes.
*  You can even take people who have type 2 diabetes, and if you get them to lose enough weight,
*  what you will see is that their lean tissues, the fat in their lean tissues will start to
*  clear out and their type 2 diabetes will go into remission.
*  So you can literally reverse people's type 2 diabetes just by restricting their calorie
*  intake and causing them to lose fat.
*  And at the same time, you see improvements in other risk factors like blood pressure,
*  blood lipids, things that are known to contribute to cardiovascular disease.
*  You see the same thing with bariatric surgery.
*  Major weight loss via bariatric surgery is associated with stunning improvements in health
*  outcomes.
*  Like you reduce your risk of developing diabetes by like 87%.
*  You reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease by something like 50%.
*  You reduce your risk of developing certain cancers of all cause mortality.
*  The effects are huge.
*  And so if you look at the intervention studies, there's really, in my mind, there's very
*  little room for different interpretations other than that body fat has a major impact
*  on our health.
*  So I think if you back up five years, our conversation is pretty current right then.
*  And where this then goes is the problem is we don't have a good intervention.
*  Individual willpower, diet and exercise kinds of interventions, they don't really work.
*  You can imagine very heavy handed regulation that would change the environment.
*  The light things like caloric labeling and trying to address food deserts, that hasn't
*  really worked.
*  Heavy things like you saw in Denmark attacks on saturated fat rich foods.
*  They had to scrap it because it was so politically unpopular.
*  New York City banned large sodas in 2013.
*  That was repealed by a court.
*  So the idea that you're going to radically change the food environment through legislation,
*  that's not really there either.
*  It's a bariatric surgery.
*  That's a pretty intense kind of medical intervention.
*  And then, I mean, I know it's not truly in drug development all of a sudden, but it really
*  feels like all of a sudden, you now have this new class of drugs, semi-glutides, that are
*  seeing a totally different kind of effect.
*  So tell me a bit about these new drugs and how their effects compare to what we've seen
*  before and how they work, how they create those effects.
*  Yeah.
*  So just to give you a basis for comparison, as I said before, an effective best in class
*  behavioral weight loss program, so that means diet and lifestyle, for the average person
*  is going to produce something like five to seven percent weight loss.
*  That will gradually diminish over the years, so they'll have a tendency to regain over
*  the years.
*  So that's not nothing, but it's not as much as most people would prefer, not as much as
*  their doctors would prefer.
*  We've talked about some of the reasons why that's the case.
*  We have these brain systems that push back against weight loss and tend to cause us to
*  regain.
*  And so there are a lot of people who have been doing research on these brain systems,
*  trying to understand how they work and trying to find ways to target them.
*  And my book is about trying to understand these brain systems.
*  But at the time I wrote it, we didn't have these new GLP-1 receptor agonists like somaglutide.
*  And so I think it's really interesting that that is exactly what these drugs do.
*  They target these brain circuits that regulate food intake and body fatness.
*  So somaglutide, just to give you first the percentages, somaglutide in randomized controlled
*  trials, which again is that rigorous way of measuring biological effects, causes typically
*  15 to 18 percent loss of body weight.
*  So it's much more effective for weight loss than your typical behavioral weight loss program.
*  And it's based on a hormone called GLP-1 that is secreted in the gut when we eat food, the
*  distal small intestine and signals from the gut to the brain.
*  It's also a neurotransmitter that's used in the brainstem as part of satiety processing.
*  So that process that we talked about earlier, how the brain accumulates information about
*  what we've eaten and eventually generates the satiation or satiety response that causes
*  us to terminate a meal.
*  So basically this drug goes into the brain and it stimulates these satiety circuits
*  in the brain.
*  And what you see is people's calorie intake drops by quite a lot.
*  They lose weight and they gain better control over their eating behavior.
*  And what is the experience of being on a drug like this?
*  What would I feel if I were on it?
*  How do I administer it?
*  What are some of the side effects?
*  Just subjectively, what is it like to try one of these therapies?
*  Yeah, so I've never been on them and I'm also not a doctor.
*  I don't work with patients who have been on them.
*  So what I know about it is just from hearing people describe it, hearing patients describe
*  it, hearing doctors describe it.
*  It is an injection.
*  It's a very small injection that you do once a week.
*  And typically what would happen is you would start on a very low dose and frequently people
*  will start off experiencing some gastrointestinal side effects.
*  So things like nausea or diarrhea or constipation.
*  Typically those are things that happen in the beginning during the dose escalation phase.
*  So you would gradually escalate the amount that you're taking over a period of a couple
*  of months.
*  And usually by the time people are done escalating, they aren't experiencing those side effects
*  anymore.
*  What they are continuing to experience is that they're not as hungry anymore.
*  They're not experiencing the same type of cravings for food.
*  So cravings are greatly reduced.
*  Food is not as seductive to you as it used to be.
*  You're not losing control over your eating behavior like you used to.
*  That's actually one of the most marked and durable effects of somaglotide.
*  So it's really targeting both these circuits that drive us to eat energy as well as the
*  circuits that determine the seductiveness of food, the reward value of food.
*  And interestingly along those lines, people report that they also often experience a reduced
*  drive to engage in other reward driven behaviors like drinking alcohol and online shopping.
*  So that's additional evidence that it targets reward circuits.
*  And in fact, there's research happening right now in the drug addiction field looking at
*  the ability of these drugs to target addiction.
*  And in fact, that's common for a lot of obesity drugs.
*  So a lot of the weight loss drugs that we have target pathways in the brain that are
*  related to food reward and addiction.
*  And one of the things that, at least I've read about this, is the thermostatic set pointy
*  effect is not wiped out here.
*  So one concern people have is that these therapies are functionally forever therapies that in
*  the cases where people have used them and use them successfully and then gone off them.
*  I mean, they are expensive.
*  They're about $15,000 a year right now.
*  That there's the kind of same snapback effect you see on other things that your body turns
*  up the heat again and you have a lot more appetite and it wants to get you back to where
*  you were.
*  Is that a fair description of what you've seen in the research and in the studies?
*  Yes, when you stop taking the drug.
*  I think it's important to contextualize this though.
*  And by the way, I think the cost of these drugs is a really huge barrier.
*  And I think that is an important one to acknowledge.
*  But it's important to contextualize that any weight loss intervention that you're doing,
*  if you stop doing it, you're going to regain the weight.
*  So that's not something that's unique to semaglutide.
*  That's something that happens for any kind of weight loss method.
*  In a perfect world, we would be able to drop the weight and then stop doing whatever we
*  were doing and just cruise at the new weight.
*  But that's not how the hypothalamus works.
*  The hypothalamus and the rest of the brain is determining your weight based on the signals
*  that you're feeding it.
*  And if you stop feeding it, those slimming signals, it's going to go back to the weight
*  where you were.
*  So there's that context.
*  And then there's also the context of other drugs like antihypertensive medications, so
*  blood pressure drugs and drugs for cholesterol.
*  Those drugs, the benefits only last for as long as you're taking the drugs.
*  You don't expect your cholesterol to stay low if you go off of the cholesterol lowering
*  drug.
*  So as much as we would love to have a drug that permanently resets the set point, take
*  it temporarily and permanently reset it, that unfortunately is not what we have currently.
*  I want to talk about some of the other things we've seen in the studies here.
*  So you have a great piece on this and you write that in two of these major trials, some
*  agglutide reduces major cardiovascular events by 21 to 24 percent in people with type 2
*  diabetes and high cardiovascular risk respectively.
*  That's comparable to commonly used cholesterol lowering drugs.
*  So it seems that we're not just seeing a reduction in weight, but we're also seeing a reduction
*  in the sort of dangerous events that have been at least associated with high weight.
*  Is that fair?
*  Absolutely.
*  And I think this is consistent with other weight loss methods like bariatric surgery.
*  There's also a meta analysis of voluntary diet weight loss trials showing that it reduces
*  all cause of mortality.
*  So I think this is pretty consistent with at least some other weight loss methods.
*  That said, it is absolutely not a given that a weight loss drug will improve your health.
*  And in fact, in that piece that you mentioned, I discussed several examples of weight loss
*  drugs that were actually catastrophic for people's health.
*  One of them that I think I didn't include in that piece, but one of the best examples
*  is fenfen, which is a combination of two drugs that cause massive cardiovascular harm.
*  So at the time that people were taking fenfen, it was relatively effective weight loss drug
*  relative to the other options that were available, but it damaged the heart.
*  So it wasn't the weight loss itself that was unhealthy.
*  It was the side effects of this drug on the cardiovascular system.
*  So if you can get a drug that causes weight loss without causing catastrophic side effects
*  for health, then I would very much expect it to benefit health.
*  Now of course, that needs to be directly demonstrated with any intervention like this.
*  But thus far, the evidence we have for somaglutide and that drug class suggests that that does apply.
*  And are we confident in the duration of that evidence?
*  We're talking here about drugs people might be on functionally for their entire lives.
*  They at least seem to many to be quite new in the market.
*  I mean, they certainly are new in terms of being widely prescribed.
*  Are we confident that five years from now, 15 years from now, it's not going to be another
*  one of these, oh, yeah, that definitely seemed good at the time.
*  But it turns out it causes total like taking a wrecking ball to your lungs or something.
*  I don't think that we have enough evidence to completely exclude long term adverse effects.
*  That said, we actually have a lot of data on this drug class.
*  So not somaglutide, but other related drugs stretching back for 18 years.
*  And as far as we can tell, it's a very safe drug class.
*  The other thing, so we have evidence suggesting that cardiovascular risk is lower than in
*  people with type two diabetes.
*  All cause mortality is reduced by somaglutide.
*  And we have thousands and thousands of people who have gone through randomized controlled
*  trials at this point.
*  They're relatively short term.
*  I think the longest one has been maybe two years.
*  And so I would say, you know, somaglutide has been in use for a while for diabetes.
*  And there are people who have been using it off label for obesity at the current dosage
*  that is now FDA approved and is called WIGV.
*  And so we do have data, you know, we have years of data.
*  We don't have two decades of data on somaglutide per se.
*  So is there some uncertainty remaining?
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  But I think you have to consider that, you know, a person who has obesity and is not
*  being treated for that is already at substantial risk of health problems.
*  So the question is, based on what we know right now of the demonstrated benefits of
*  no real signal of harm and of the harm of not doing anything, where is the cost benefit
*  balance for this?
*  And to me, I think it's an absolute win.
*  But you know, I cannot completely exclude the possibility that we'll learn something
*  bad at some point in the future about it.
*  I just think it's very unlikely.
*  One of the weird reports that is being seen a lot that you read up is that these aren't
*  just reducing food cravings.
*  We're also seeing sort of a wide spectrum of dopamine backed behaviors go down, including
*  drinking alcohol, including, you know, late night Amazon shopping.
*  Tell me a bit about that and the theory around it.
*  I think these kinds of effects are a little bit surprising to some people, including me,
*  because if you look at the site of action of these drugs, the primary site of action
*  is in these satiety centers in the brainstem.
*  And so why would affecting satiety and hunger, why would that impact things like drug use
*  and shopping, other reward driven behaviors?
*  And there are some suggestions in the scientific literature that this drug might target some
*  reward related regions directly, but it's really not clear how that happens.
*  What we do know is that downstream of these initial cells that actually have the GLP-1
*  receptors, you do get activation of, you get changes in activity in reward related regions.
*  And so it's not really clear to me whether it's like this drug has two effects.
*  One is specifically on reward in general.
*  One is on appetite.
*  And those, you know, both converge on the weight loss effect or whether the effects
*  on reward are downstream of the effects in these satiety circuits.
*  And all of what we're seeing is ultimately coming from these satiety circuits.
*  So I think it's really not clear.
*  But I think it is an interesting observation that if you look at the most effective obesity
*  drugs that we have, pretty much all of them target both of those things, the reward and
*  the appetite.
*  Tell me a bit about what looks to be the next generation of these drugs or combination drugs
*  or therapeutic approaches.
*  So I mean, it's a great time for this research field and it's a great time for the pharmaceutical
*  industry in this area.
*  Let me just say, first of all, I have no conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry,
*  just to make that clear.
*  But there are lots of drugs in the pipeline right now that are very exciting for weight
*  loss and obesity management.
*  So the one that I'll start with is called terzepotide.
*  And that is from Eli Lilly.
*  And that is also a similar type of drug to semaglutide.
*  It's based on the GLP-1 hormone.
*  It's kind of interesting.
*  It's a combination.
*  It also has another hormone, GIP.
*  It's both of those fused together.
*  And that drug appears to be even more effective than semaglutide.
*  So if you look at the amount of weight loss that's produced by it, it's more in the kind
*  of 18 to 22% range rather than the 15 to 18% range of semaglutide.
*  So it's a little bit more effective.
*  It's also a little bit more effective for treating diabetes, which is where both of
*  these drugs came from initially.
*  And then we just have other drugs that are being developed that are kind of in a similar
*  class based on the GLP-1 signaling pathway.
*  And it's really interesting.
*  This kind of gut-to-brain communication highway is really the thing that's been the most productive
*  in the development of weight loss therapy.
*  So if you look at bariatric surgery, you're modifying the digestive tract in order to
*  alter eating behaviors and eating drive.
*  And with these drugs, you're modifying gut-brain communication as well.
*  So it's been really a very productive pathway.
*  One of the things that I'm really interested in is a drug that Pfizer is developing that
*  is a small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist.
*  And the advantage of that is you can make it into a pill that you can just eat and possibly
*  longer shelf life, possibly lower production costs.
*  And that solves a lot of the kind of technical problems with these GLP-1 receptor agonists.
*  So that's currently in the clinical trial pipeline.
*  I don't know whether it will eventually become an FDA approved weight loss drug, but right
*  now it looks really promising.
*  I want to, as we kind of end here, zoom out to what seems like a slightly weird picture,
*  at least a picture to fully appreciate.
*  We've talked about sort of the way the brain evolved.
*  We've talked sort of negatively, but you can really see it, I think, as a remarkable achievement
*  of human civilization that at least for many of us, not everybody in the world, of course,
*  the problem is this food abundance and this technological creation of foods that are unbelievably
*  tasty and sugary and salty and palatable, right?
*  It's just a joy to eat a lot of this food and we have the ability to do it all the time.
*  And that we've done this and now we're having to create very expensive injectable drugs
*  to rework our brains so we can survive in this food environment that we have created
*  by choice, such that it doesn't make us sick over time.
*  There's just a strangeness to it that I'm curious if you have any thoughts or reflections on.
*  Yeah, it is very strange.
*  You know, I think if we zoom out and take the bigger picture, essentially with the progress
*  of technology and affluence, we have gotten increasingly good at satisfying our own innate
*  preferences.
*  We see that with food, we see it with information like social media and other media.
*  We see it with pornography, etc., etc., etc.
*  And I think essentially we're just fulfilling our own preferences so hard that we're creating
*  problems for ourselves.
*  And now through this same affluence and technology, we're trying to create technological solutions
*  for these problems that are created by this evolutionary mismatch.
*  And I don't think this is the world that any of us want.
*  I don't think we want to be in a situation where we are creating massive problems for
*  ourselves and then having to solve them through technology.
*  I think all of us would rather live in a world where those problems were not there in the
*  first place.
*  But that's not the world we live in.
*  And this is the world we've created too, like you said.
*  We created this through consumer demand, our food environment, our media environment, etc.
*  And it's not all a bad thing, of course.
*  There are many good things about it.
*  But at this point, it's hard to see a solution that is not technological, in my opinion.
*  Is this just the condition of modernity on some level?
*  I mean, when I look at this issue, it feels actually in many ways very similar to things
*  like climate change.
*  We have had this amazing success in creating energy abundance.
*  That energy abundance has created energy abundance for some, maybe is what I should say there.
*  But that abundance of energy compared to the history of our species has created terrible
*  effects.
*  And now we're coming up with a lot of technological solutions that I think are actually the most
*  realistic solutions.
*  I'm not somebody who believes we're going to get people to stop using energy, but we're
*  going to have a lot of lithium mining and maybe eventually we're going to have geoengineering
*  and we've got to put solar panels everywhere and wind turbines everywhere and run electric
*  transmission everywhere.
*  And sometimes I feel like it's all the same story playing out again and again, in a way
*  is what Elizabeth Colbert's Under a White Sky is about.
*  But these problems of control, like we have had amazing successes controlling our world,
*  that then creates difficulties, sometimes really profound ones.
*  And then we have to control those problems and then we have to deal with the problems
*  of the controls we put in place.
*  And it can sometimes feel like Wile E. Coyote just like always running a little bit ahead
*  of the realization of what we've done.
*  But on the other hand, on the other side of it, these are really amazing human achievements.
*  And I kind of can't quite tell what to do with the feeling of weirdness it inspires.
*  And on the other hand, I think as you're saying here, we're not going back to the
*  days of food scarcity or we don't want to anyway.
*  And I don't think we're going back to days of not having enough energy and not having
*  cars and so on.
*  And so maybe it's something to embrace rather than feel strange about.
*  Yeah, I think that's a great analogy.
*  I would say that one place where our food environment diverges from that analogy is
*  that climate change is a collective problem, whereas obesity is an individual problem.
*  I mean, it has societal influences, of course, but the one person having obesity doesn't
*  affect other people having obesity.
*  And so I think and where I'm going with this is that as an individual, you can make a
*  difference for yourself.
*  So I think that on a societal level, it's hard to imagine a solution that is not technological,
*  in my opinion, because I just don't see us regulating our food environment to such an
*  extent that it reverses the obesity epidemic.
*  However, on an individual level, we can absolutely improve our own food environment and reduce
*  our own risk of obesity.
*  So I think that's a place where it contrasts with climate change, where with climate change,
*  you can control your own carbon dioxide production, but it's not, it's a drop in the bucket in
*  terms of global CO2 levels.
*  I think that's a fair point.
*  I think it's all a good place to end.
*  So always our final question.
*  What are the three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  So the first one I want to recommend is Herman Ponser's book, Burn.
*  It's a really great book on several levels.
*  First of all, it's really well written, really entertaining.
*  And second of all, as opposed to a lot of nutrition books or nutrition and physiology
*  related books that make big claims about having some kind of incredible discovery about the
*  human body, this book actually does have an incredible discovery about the human body
*  and it relates to the relationship between our energy expenditure and our physical activity
*  level, which we were discussing earlier.
*  Just a really great book.
*  Second one I want to recommend is Michael Moss's Salt, Sugar, Fat.
*  Also a really entertaining book and it really details the kind of path that the food industry
*  took that brought us to where we are today in terms of our current processed food environment
*  in the United States.
*  It's really interesting behind the scenes look at that.
*  And the third book I want to recommend is The Secret of Our Success by Joe Henrik.
*  Joe Henrik is an anthropologist who has some really interesting ideas about what it means
*  to be human and what is special about the human species that made us so successful relative
*  to other species.
