# Cows: Just an Environmental Disaster
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em98EioWeT4)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  I think one of the questions on which our whole future hinges is whether the lives that
*  we have, the lives that we want, can exist within our environmental limits.
*  Is there a way to live lives as energetically rich, as materially prosperous as Americans
*  do now, without doing irreparable damage to the world?
*  Is there a way for people all over to live lives even better than Americans do without
*  doing irreparable damage to the world?
*  Can we decouple material prosperity from the environment?
*  If we can't, then what we're left with is a politics of sacrifice.
*  From Raskin residents of rich countries to give up what they have, Raskin residents of
*  poor and middle income countries to give up what they want, there is no way around that.
*  I've read the Degrowth books that is, in any honest rendering, what they are asking.
*  And the politics of sacrifice, they're abysmal, they're really hard, particularly at the speed
*  at which we need to act on climate.
*  You try passing a global carbon tax and enforcing it.
*  You try doing energetic redistribution between rich and poor countries.
*  You try banning, God forbid, hamburgers.
*  But if you can marry prosperity to sustainability, if we can power the lives we want with clean
*  energy, if we can feed the world without wrecking every ecosystem in our sight, then we have
*  the politics of transition.
*  And the politics of transition is hard.
*  Deployment is hard.
*  Change is hard.
*  But it is more imaginable.
*  And maybe you can even promise that things get better, too, that we get cleaner air,
*  healthier food, regenerated forests.
*  That's a bet a lot of the climate movement is now making.
*  It's a bet most countries are now making.
*  But is it possible or is it just a fantasy?
*  Do we actually have the critical minerals, the land, the technology?
*  That's a question that Hannah Richie, the lead researcher at Our World and Data, set
*  out to answer in a book, Not the End of the World.
*  It's a question that obsesses me, so I asked her to come on the show to talk about it.
*  As always, my email for guest suggestions, for feedback, for reflections, Ezra Klein
*  show at NYTimes.com.
*  Hannah Richie, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks very much for having me.
*  I've heard you say something that has stuck in my mind, which is that air pollution is
*  a problem of energy poverty.
*  What do you mean by that?
*  So air pollution is generated when we burn stuff.
*  And I think when people think of burning stuff, they automatically think of burning fossil
*  fuels, which is absolutely correct.
*  We also generate air pollution when we burn wood or charcoal or crop waste or dung, which
*  many people in the world, especially the poorest people in the world, rely on as their main
*  energy source.
*  So I think if you see images of Lahore or New Delhi in the US, we think, oh my God,
*  the levels of pollution there.
*  But go back less than a century.
*  And that's what, I mean, I'm in Edinburgh in Scotland.
*  That's what Edinburgh looked like.
*  That's what London looked like.
*  That's probably what New York looked like.
*  It's just that we are now further along the curve of pollution than many of these cities.
*  What we tend to find is that air pollution follows what we call the environmental business
*  curve.
*  So if you imagine a graph and on the y-axis you have air pollution and on the x-axis you
*  have GDP or income or wealth, what you tend to see is this upside down U shape.
*  So at very, very low incomes, outdoor air pollution, for example, can be relatively
*  low.
*  What happens is that people get access to energy, they get access to industrial production,
*  they get access to cars and pollution starts to increase.
*  Now on that part of the curve, people accept that there's a trade-off.
*  Their need for energy trumps their need for clean air and therefore they put up with the
*  dirty air because they just need it for energy.
*  Or I should be said, they don't always have a choice.
*  Yes, they don't have alternatives and fossil fuels is the only option they have.
*  Millions of people die simply because they do not even have access to fossil fuels.
*  They're stuck on wood or charcoal.
*  What's the death toll of air pollution annually?
*  So there are a range of estimates.
*  All of the estimates are in the millions.
*  I mean the WHO, the World Health Organization, has a figure of around 7 million every year
*  and around 57 million people die every year.
*  It was slightly higher during COVID.
*  If you take, you know, 57 million and you say 7 million are dying from air pollution,
*  you're talking about more than 10% of deaths can be attributed in some way to air pollution.
*  I want to zoom in on something happening on the part where the curve begins to slope down
*  as the country gets richer.
*  Because one way of thinking about air pollution, but a lot of environmental problems, is it
*  to get less of the bad thing, you need less of the good thing.
*  To get less air pollution, you need less industry.
*  To get less air pollution, you need fewer cars.
*  But to use the example of the United States, we have many more cars today than we had in
*  1970 or 1975.
*  But the air in 1975 was much worse than it is today.
*  You go to California, you go to Los Angeles, where I grew up, I mean the smog that would
*  settle over LA was legendary.
*  So how is that part happening?
*  How are you getting less air pollution even as you are having an energetically richer
*  life, even as you're having a rise in the quantity of industrial production?
*  Yeah, so you've got two options.
*  You can do less stuff, as you say, or you can improve the technologies so you can get
*  the same stuff just with less pollution or less externalities.
*  And there are a couple of key innovations here.
*  I mean, I think that your example of cars is absolutely correct.
*  There just have been massive developments in the reduction in pollution from cars.
*  And that's a combination of one, policy controls, so forcing manufacturers to develop cars that
*  emit less.
*  But it's also about then the technological innovation that comes from that kind of forced
*  policy setting.
*  And industrial sites, for example, like a big issue across Europe and North America,
*  which is basically gone, was acid rain.
*  And there, the problem was sulfur dioxide.
*  So when we burn coal, you produce sulfur dioxide.
*  And that was leaking out into the environment and causing acid rain.
*  Emissions of sulfur dioxide have plummeted.
*  And again, there were two ways to do that.
*  One, you could just stop burning coal.
*  And to some extent, that transition has happened.
*  But another big innovation there is that we just developed a technology called a scrubber
*  or a desulfurization technology that you could literally just put in the smokestack of the
*  coal plant and take the sulfur out.
*  That needed some push from government policy to force that innovation.
*  And then it needed some investment to get there.
*  But that was the flip side of the coin of you don't need to just necessarily do less.
*  You can develop technologies that can do better.
*  Sometimes there's an argument, and certainly there's a suspicion, that what is happening
*  is the rich countries are pushing their environmental problems out into the poor countries.
*  We used to make the dirty stuff here, burn the coal here.
*  Now we do it in China and we just buy the end product from China.
*  We're going to talk about that in the carbon case a bit later on.
*  But is that the case for air pollution?
*  No, I don't think that's really the case with air pollution.
*  Yes, the UK and the US have reduced levels of air pollution.
*  But so has China.
*  So it cannot possibly be the case that we're just offshoring all of the pollution to China
*  if China's pollution is also falling rapidly and it has fallen rapidly.
*  Over the last decade, local air pollution in cities like Beijing and other major cities
*  across China have really plummeted with massive health benefits for those populations.
*  To just add some numbers to that, because I think they're really striking.
*  In Beijing, air pollution fell by 55% between 2013 and 2020.
*  The number you have in the book for China as a whole is 40%.
*  So how did they do that?
*  What is happening that China could make air pollution fall so much faster than other countries
*  have been able to do it in the past?
*  So this was really kickstarted by the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
*  Pre-2008, if you were to ask someone, picture a city with really high levels of air pollution,
*  they'd probably picture Beijing.
*  And the world was descending on Beijing for the Olympics.
*  The top athletes in the world were coming to the city and all eyes were on Beijing.
*  The Chinese government realized, you know, we can't have just a horrendously polluted
*  city.
*  We have to clean this up for the athletes that are coming in.
*  And it was still one of the most polluted Olympics ever, but emissions and levels of
*  air pollution were much lower than they were pre-Olympics.
*  The problem is that when all the athletes went home and all of the eyes turned away,
*  the pollution levels came back.
*  It was a very short-term reduction in order to facilitate the Olympics.
*  A couple of years on, and it was actually really a public backlash that said, why would
*  the government do this for people coming in to watch the Olympics, but not do it for us
*  and we have to live here day after day, year after year with terrible impacts on health.
*  And it was really this public pressure that kickstarted action on concerted reductions
*  and levels of air pollution.
*  The key one has been really strict reduction in coal burning in households, for example,
*  which you would imagine in Edinburgh or London a century ago as well.
*  It's the same in China where people were using coal in cities to heat their homes.
*  And there was a really strict crackdown on that.
*  In some sense, too strict, such that some households were temporarily left without energy.
*  A shifting of industry outside of the city.
*  The problem is that often you'll have industrial sites very, very close to dense population
*  centres, so you can move those industrial sites further out where there are less people.
*  And then strict industrial controls.
*  And in China, strict regulation can be put in place very, very quickly, and actually
*  industries do take action very quickly.
*  How much is the rapidity of what China was able to do because we simply have more ways
*  to generate energy in 2024 than we did in 1904 without burning things?
*  We have nuclear energy, we have solar energy, we have wind energy, we have advanced battery
*  technology.
*  How much is that an enabler of the possibilities here?
*  I think for China in the last decade, it hasn't been, that contribution hasn't been massive.
*  Now to be clear, China is rolling out renewable energy very, very, very quickly.
*  It's rolling out electric cars extremely quickly.
*  But it's still burning more coal than it was a decade ago.
*  But as I say, going forward, and I think for many other countries, this opportunity to
*  skip a lot of the burning stuff phase of energy and moving straight to energy technologies
*  where you don't burn stuff is a massive opportunity to avoid the really high emissions and high
*  polluting pathway that most countries have now been through.
*  I mean, I think people underestimate how unique this current position is that we're in.
*  You said a century ago, but literally since the invention of fire, humans have been burning
*  stuff to generate energy.
*  It's only very, very recently that we now have the technologies and the opportunity
*  to generate large amounts of energy, large and cheap energy without burning stuff.
*  And I think people underestimate the scale of that opportunity.
*  One reason I really like the air pollution chapter in your book is that it sort of operates,
*  I think, as a metaphor, which is, is this thing we did with air pollution, this thing
*  we keep doing with air pollution, where we are able to bring it sharply down, the air
*  in London, as you say, might be cleaner now than it has been in centuries, is that possible
*  for other kinds of environmental harm?
*  Because I do think there is this question that sits in people's minds of whether the
*  materially rich lives that we live in in richer countries today is possible for the planet
*  without completely cooking it.
*  And one of the ways you look at this is by comparing your carbon footprint to that of
*  your grandparents.
*  And it's a kind of surprising comparison.
*  So can you walk me through that?
*  Yeah, so if you look at the carbon footprint of the average person in the UK over time,
*  what you see is that over the last few decades, emissions in the UK have fallen really sharply.
*  So since 1990, they've fallen by around 50%.
*  The pushback on that is always, well, we've only achieved that because we've offshored
*  emissions to other countries, and that's not a genuine reduction.
*  Now, it's completely true that the UK has offshored some of its emissions.
*  But even when you account for that, and you account for that based on what we call
*  consumption-based emissions, so it tries to adjust for the goods and services that the
*  UK is buying and importing, and allocates those emissions to the UK rather than China,
*  for example, what you find is that emissions are still falling, and still falling pretty quickly.
*  And what that means is that my carbon footprint today is less than my grandparents when they
*  were my age, despite the fact that if you looked at our lifestyles, I think you would
*  think that mine is much more luxurious than theirs was, and I'm sure they would say the same.
*  And this is really the result of just technological change and decarbonisation.
*  And if you look at pre-Paris Agreement, so Paris Agreement 2015, the course that we were
*  talking about the world heading towards then was like four to five degrees, and that was just
*  completely catastrophic. That's not really the pathway that we think we're on anymore.
*  We're kind of on track for between two and a half to three degrees.
*  Now, to be clear, that's not unacceptable. We do not want to be on a path towards two and a
*  half degrees. But it is vastly different from a world of four degrees. We've chopped off a
*  degree of that trajectory, at least a degree of that trajectory that we thought we were on.
*  The point you make that I found somewhat revelatory, even though it makes total sense
*  now that I think about it, is that actually as you get into higher numbers, right, as we hit
*  one and a half degrees, if we hit two degrees, that every tenth of a point after that becomes
*  more, not less, consequential. Can you talk through that idea of sort of the increasing
*  marginal value of reducing climate change?
*  Yeah, so we know that the impact of climate change, and by that I mean the impact that
*  temperature has on stuff like precipitation patterns, for example, does not scale linearly
*  with warming. So going from 1.5 degrees to two degrees is worse than going from one degree to
*  1.5 degree. So as we get into these higher and higher temperature ranges, we expect that the
*  impacts will not be linear and they will scale much more quickly, which means that our emphasis
*  to keep temperatures as low as possible increases the higher the temperatures go. We also risk
*  hitting feedback loops, or to some extent tipping points, which can amplify warming.
*  The words tipping points are kind of thrown around quite freely, and often people don't define them
*  very clearly. Here I'm not necessarily talking about really large planetary scale tipping
*  points that somehow flip us from one system into another. I'm often talking about more localized
*  tipping points that we know exist in the system, but don't know exactly where they are.
*  So if you take an example, for example, of Arctic sea ice, it is quite likely that by 2050 we will
*  have some summers where there's no Arctic sea ice. It will recover in the winter, but during the
*  summer we might have no Arctic sea ice. Ice reflects sunlight and therefore you have less
*  being reflected. Now that's not going to have a massive impact on the global climate system,
*  but it could increase our warming by, I don't know, the estimates about 0.15 degrees.
*  Now if you hit several of these feedback loops or tipping points, again you might not go from
*  2 degrees to 5 degrees, but you could very easily increase the temperature by 0.2 degrees,
*  0.3 degrees, 0.4 degrees, which means that if you are at a temperature of 1.8 degrees,
*  you're then shifted into a world of 2.2 degrees. I think the key point here is that we don't know
*  exactly where these tipping points are, but some of them are potentially in that 1.5 to 2 degree
*  range and you'd certainly massively increase the risk of hitting them the higher and closer you are
*  to 2 degrees. So that's why going from 1.8 to 2 degrees is much more consequential than going from
*  1.3 to 1.5. I was struck reading through your book how much the solutions or the ameliorating
*  policies seem to stretch across problem areas. I mean it seems to me basically you're talking
*  about really two things over and over and over again, which is don't burn so much stuff
*  and try to reduce the human footprint over land. And if you could get those two things more or less
*  right, we could be in a much better place. Like that's a question of political will and organization
*  and cooperation and it is an extraordinarily hard question as we've talked about and as everybody
*  knows. But it is not an unsolvable problem. It is a set of choices we make or we do not make.
*  I think these are tractable problems. They're not easy problems. They're really, really difficult
*  to tackle, but they're tractable and the solutions that we have to solve them are getting better
*  year after year after year. For me, what's key is that they're linking up with other co-benefits
*  and stuff that people care about in the shorter term. So if you're talking about energy, for example,
*  we're in a vastly different position from where we were a decade ago because it's not just about
*  tackling climate change or tackling air pollution. It's also about energy security. It's about having
*  lowered energy bills. It's about having more localized energy systems, which makes me more
*  optimistic that they become viable and accelerate. When people think about the vast array of
*  environmental problems that we face, they get really overwhelmed and they get really overwhelmed
*  because they assume there are 50 solutions to 10 different problems and therefore we need to find
*  a way of implementing 500 different solutions. As you say, the reality is that when you bring
*  it down to the basics, we need to stop burning stuff for energy and we need to find a way of
*  feeding people on much less land. I think we are getting closer and closer to the solutions we need
*  and the solutions are getting better and better for us to do that every year. One of the most
*  common questions I just hear at all is whether it is possible for all these different countries
*  to be powered by clean energy sources, renewables, nuclear. We know there's a lot of solar power.
*  The sun is big and it keeps shining. We know there's a fair amount of wind, but other things are
*  limiting factors. The number of minerals we have to create solar panels with. You've got to mine
*  all this lithium and mine all this cobalt to get your batteries. As a matter of material, as a matter
*  of how much the earth has to give us, can we do what we need to do? Can we live and have more
*  people living the kinds of lifestyles we see in the UK and the US built on a clean energy foundation?
*  So there are a large number of researchers and different research organizations that have studied
*  this question and the answer that comes out is nearly always, yes, we have enough stuff.
*  This has been said by the International Energy Agency. This has been said by Bloomberg,
*  New Energy Finance, by the Paine Institute. There was a recent paper by Saver Wang and
*  Zeke Hausweiler and colleagues where they looked at the mineral requirements specifically on
*  low-carbon electricity globally. The resounding answer was there are almost no minerals where
*  total amount is a constraint. What people also underestimate is that the amount of stuff we know
*  we have or think we can extract tends to go up over time. That's because we found new deposits,
*  we found new ways of extracting stuff that we couldn't extract before, and actually just the
*  drive for low-carbon energy will just increase our efforts in order to do that. The other key
*  change there goes in the other direction, where we're becoming much more material efficient about
*  building this stuff. The amount of materials you need to build a solar panel today is not what it
*  was a decade ago. For many of these minerals you need far, far less. So our amount of supplies are
*  going to go up and our material requirements are probably going to go down. So if we were looking
*  into the future, I'm just not concerned about total material requirements. I get constantly
*  emails from people after we do climate episodes suggesting, hey look, from what I can tell,
*  the amount of mining we are going to need to do here to do this renewable energy transition,
*  this is not a clean transition. This is just hiding the dirtiness somewhere else.
*  Are people right to be suspicious that the mining we're going to need, the intensity of getting the
*  earth to give up what it needs to give up, if we're going to have all these solar panels and
*  batteries and turbines, that that's going to blunt a lot of the efficacy of turning over to these
*  fuels. I think what's key to highlight here is that there are no perfect solutions to this. There
*  are no perfect solutions to meeting our energy needs or the energy transition. And I think the
*  tough reality is that if we're looking for a perfect solution that needs no materials, that
*  needs no land, that has zero impacts whatsoever, we'll be waiting forever and we'll just stay on
*  this course of fossil fuels. So what we're looking for are solutions that are much, much, much better
*  than fossil fuels. And the reality is that we have them. Estimates for the amount of material
*  requirements for mining is something like tens of millions of tonnes per year, an upper limit.
*  Compare that to how much fossil fuels we're currently extracting. That's 15 billion tonnes
*  every single year. We're talking about mining orders of magnitude lower amount of materials
*  compared to fossil fuels. It's vastly, vastly different. And these are very, very vastly
*  different systems. With fossil fuels, you extract them, you burn them, you extract them, you burn
*  them. You get nothing back in return. What's going to happen with the energy transition is that we're
*  going to need this massive ramp up period where we're building stuff. So we are extracting a lot
*  of materials out of the earth, but you can reuse that stuff at the end of its life. And I think we
*  will also see massive leaps in terms of recycling or refurbishing these materials back into the
*  system later. So we will have this big ramp up period, but we'll move to a much more circular
*  and sustainable system, which is vastly different from a fossil fuel system where it's just extract,
*  extract, extract. To hold on that point about recycling for a minute, if you have a car that
*  burns gasoline, you burn every tank of gasoline until you're done with the car and there's no
*  gasoline left at the end of that. If you have an electric vehicle, when you want to trade up for a
*  different model or your car has reached the end of its useful life, that battery still has lithium
*  and other things in it that can be reused. I mean, right now people reuse the minerals in electric
*  vehicle batteries. And so at the very least there's a possibility. I'm always a little bit
*  skeptical of recycling because there are plenty of things that people think they can recycle that
*  they cannot. But the things that are precious, you often can and things like car batteries seem
*  to be one of those even now. Yeah, exactly. And I think again, this comes back to underestimating
*  how rapidly I think some of these technologies could shift where it might not even be the case
*  that the materials in your current electric car battery go into another electric car battery at
*  the end of their life. They might be able to power more than one battery and that's because
*  the material requirements for a battery in 15 years might be much lower than they are today
*  just because we've had so much innovation and advancement in these technologies.
*  Let's talk a bit about some of the different sources of energy here and sources of what get
*  called clean energy. So you have renewables and mainly I think what people are thinking of there
*  are solar and wind. And the difficulty of solar and wind right now, particularly politically,
*  is that solar and wind require or seem to require a lot more land than coal and gasoline.
*  I've seen a lot of estimates around how much more land they require. You question some of that in
*  the book. So tell me a bit about how you think about the land footprint of an economy that is
*  substantially powered by solar versus the same portion of that economy being powered by coal.
*  Yes, I mean, there are some studies that say if you take account of the mining and the transport
*  and the full life cycle, actually sometimes the land footprint of coal is higher than it is for
*  solar. But the fact that you get for some of these estimates is touching goal, which suggests that
*  the land footprint of solar is not massively bigger than it is for coal. The question of land
*  use for these technologies is a perfectly valid one. But I think it's important to highlight that
*  these are choices. And what I often think is a bit suspicious or people don't take account of
*  is that there are current land uses that we have that we don't really question. But as soon as solar
*  and wind come along, you know, the guardrails go up and we shouldn't build this stuff. I mean,
*  to give context, if you were to put solar panels in the US on all of the land that's currently used
*  to produce biofuels, you could power the US three times over. You would be able to easily
*  decarbonize the US and meet its energy requirements. That land use is a choice and you can make a
*  different choice. I've never heard that about biofuel production in the US. So we're talking
*  things here like growing corn for ethanol. Yeah, it's nearly all corn production for
*  ethanol that's used for road transport. And we're actually using as much of that as we would need
*  for all solar combined. Yeah, so if you put solar panels on that land, back of the envelope estimates
*  suggest that you could meet the US's electricity demand around three times over. So in some
*  theoretical world, if we just paid off every farmer at above market prices for all the land being
*  used for fairly low output ethanol from corn, we could solve a lot of these problems. I feel like
*  that's a version of this I've not really heard before. I mean, I'm not saying this is the
*  solution. I'm not saying we should put solar panels on all of that land. No, this is your policy.
*  I'm just making the point that we raise our eyebrows at the thought of how much land solar
*  would need, but no one thinks about the land that's currently being used for biofuels and
*  not particularly productive for US gasoline and cars. Well, the other version of this is nuclear.
*  So you write in the book that the most land efficient source of electricity is nuclear per
*  unit of electricity. It needs 50 times less land than coal and 18 to 27 times less than solar
*  photovoltaics on the ground. So that's striking. And nuclear is something that is obviously
*  controversial within the renewable energy debates. Tell me a bit about how you think of
*  nuclear, which on the one hand is very clean. And on the other hand, I think people perceive
*  as very dangerous. And on the third hand, if we have a third hand, really has a quality that
*  wind and solar doesn't, which is that it can kind of be anywhere and does not require very much land
*  to generate a lot of electricity. Yeah. So I think nuclear energy has a lot of merits. One of the
*  primary ones being land use. Like if you want to conserve land and produce lots of energy, nuclear
*  is ultimately your best option. It's low carbon. It is safe. I give figures in the book looking at
*  death rates from different forms of energy per unit of electricity production. And as we discussed
*  earlier, fossil fuels are off the charts because even if you take climate change out of the picture,
*  even based on local air pollution, they're just vastly more dangerous than the nuclear energy.
*  Zoom in on that for a minute because people have probably heard of two major disasters here,
*  Chernobyl and Fukushima. Can you talk about the death rates of both?
*  Sure. So Fukushima in Japan in 2011, the death toll there, I mean, the direct death toll was
*  zero. No one died in that nuclear disaster. Since then, there has been one of the workers
*  has subsequently died of cancer. And then there are what they call excess mortality deaths
*  from the stress of evacuation, the stress of the event. And they attribute that to several
*  thousands, which is obviously a lot. There is the Chernobyl disaster and more people died
*  directly from that incident. I think you're looking at tens, I think maybe up to 50 or 100.
*  It's very hard to come up with an exact total mortality impact from that disaster. But I looked
*  into a bunch of research on this and my estimate is somewhere in the low hundreds. So maybe 300
*  to 500 people died in total from Chernobyl. But as I said earlier, we have millions dying from
*  fossil fuels solely from air pollution every single year, even taking out the issue of climate
*  change. So those numbers are just so vastly different that when you crunch the numbers
*  per unit of electricity that we've produced from each of these sources,
*  nuclear energy is vastly safer than fossil fuels.
*  I want to talk about land here, because we've been talking about that in terms of energy
*  production. But I also want to talk about in terms of use because how we use land is relevant to
*  climate. It's relevant to deforestation, which your book talks about relevant to biodiversity loss,
*  which your book talks about. And I read this statistic every couple of months because of the
*  kind of work I do. And every time I'm just stopped cold by it, which is it roughly 50%
*  of ice free land on earth is used for agriculture. It's a lot. Walk me through that.
*  Yeah. So if you take the world's what we call, well, we call it habitable land. So it's basically
*  taking away the ice and the kind of barren land that you literally couldn't use for anything else
*  and other species couldn't really use for anything else. Farming uses 50% of that.
*  I mean, we produce around 5000 kilocalories per person per day. Now that's around double what the
*  average person in the world actually needs. Obviously, that does not end up on people's
*  place. So there's a massive loss in the chain there. One just losses in the supply chain or
*  consumer waste. But there are two other big ones. One is that we feed a lot of those calories and
*  crops to animals and they convert that to meat, but they do it very, very inefficiently. And we
*  also allocate like a good chunk to biofuels. And what you find is that around 75% or three quarters
*  of our agricultural land is this grazing land. And then the other 25% is for growing crops.
*  So how does that grazing land break down by animal?
*  So wild grazing land is basically just cattle and sheep and maybe some goats,
*  but stuff like chicken and pork and fish, etc. I mean, fish where we actually feed them not out
*  in the ocean. They are not raised on grazing land. They're raised on land where we grow the crops and
*  then feed them to the animal. So when you do that calculation, sort of virtually everything,
*  because goat and sheep are not major sources of human calories. I mean, they exist, but they're
*  not a huge part of the diet. All of the other meat aside from cattle is actually included in the
*  crop raising calculation. Yes, exactly. So functionally, we are using a huge portion
*  of usable human land to raise cows. Yeah, we're using a huge amount of land to raise cows.
*  Sheep are not totally insignificant. They are, especially on more marginal lands,
*  they are actually quite large land users in some countries. But yes, it's primarily cattle.
*  Cattle ranching is also the leading driver of deforestation globally. So again, it's not just
*  that we're using a lot of land for this, we're actively cutting down forests and more land to
*  raise more cattle. So can you talk a bit about where we are on that curve?
*  Yes, if you look at the history of global deforestation, it increased very rapidly in
*  the 20th century. But various estimates point towards a peak in global deforestation
*  around the 1980s. We have targets of getting to zero deforestation by 2030. And we're really not
*  on target for that. So we still have large amounts of forests being lost, but less than we were cutting
*  down in the 1980s. What's been really key there is a shift in where deforestation is happening.
*  In the UK, we cut down our forests centuries ago, and we then had all of this agricultural land
*  to use. In temperate countries, deforestation has definitely peaked, and now many forests are coming
*  back. We're regrowing forests on these old lands. The center of deforestation today is in the tropics.
*  So nearly all of our global deforestation is tropical deforestation today.
*  Beyond agriculture, to the extent there is a beyond agriculture, what are the drivers of
*  deforestation? If we wanted to take what is happening in the tropics seriously, if we wanted
*  to blunt it, what is the equivalent of shifting the energy system to renewables?
*  I mean, when it comes to deforestation, it's nearly all about farming. Cattle ranching is the biggest
*  driver by far, followed by oil crop production, so soy and palm oil. And then there are a couple
*  of other major drivers or crops. Rubber, for example, is a growing one. There's some deforestation
*  for cereal production in some regions. The primary way to increase food production,
*  in the absence of increases in crop yields, is to just cut down forests and use more land.
*  And what's the role of this in climate?
*  So I think people underestimate the contribution of food to climate change. So if you look at the
*  breakdown of emissions, around a quarter to a third of emissions come from food systems.
*  I think if you take emissions from livestock alone, it's somewhere in the region between kind
*  of 14 to 18% of greenhouse gas emissions. Without any change in this trajectory in food that we're
*  on, emissions from food alone would take us past 1.5 degrees. This was research that came out from
*  colleagues at Oxford, where they looked at just the cumulative emissions from agriculture out to
*  the end of the century. Energy emissions would have to go to zero, and even then emissions from
*  agriculture alone would take us past 1.5 degrees. So I mean, it's just very clear from the data
*  that we just cannot continue on a business as usual and food systems.
*  And tell me about the role here in biodiversity. I think people know that there's a huge,
*  genuinely historic level of species extinction happening right now. And I think in their minds,
*  in many of our minds, people assume it's probably climate right, or making the world hot and messing
*  with weather, and that's destroying species. And in some cases, that's true. But talk me through
*  the research on the relationship between that and how big of a driver function our food system is.
*  I mean, I think the first thing that jumps out when you look at the research is how little we
*  know about the world's biodiversity. Quantifying carbon emissions is easy. Quantifying what's
*  happening to the world's biodiversity is really, really difficult. And the researchers in this
*  area do amazing work. But biodiversity is just so vast that they've hardly even touched the sides.
*  But what's clear from the data that emerges is that most of the trends are downward and
*  downward very steeply. I always get this question, you know, are we in the middle of the sixth mass
*  extinction? And a couple of ways to look at this is the world has been through five big mass
*  extinctions previously. And the definition of a mass extinction is losing around 75% of the world's
*  species in a geologically short period of time. And by short here, we mean within two million years.
*  Not short to us, but on geological periods, a relatively short period of time. We're nowhere
*  near losing 75% of our species, but we're also very, very far away from this timeline of two
*  million years. So another way to compare this is to say, what is the rate by which species are going
*  extinct? And what rate were they going extinct in the previous five mass extinctions? I mean,
*  what's quite alarming is that when you look at this data, the rates by which species are going
*  extinct today are higher than any of the five previous mass extinctions. The key difference
*  there is that in the previous mass extinctions, there were these sustained very high rates for
*  very, very long periods of time. My optimism on this is that even though extinction rates are very,
*  very high, they can be stopped. And they can be stopped because we are literally the handbrake.
*  We are the ones driving this and we can be the ones to stop this or certainly slow it down
*  vastly. Climate change is one driver and I think will be a growing driver of biodiversity loss
*  in the future, but it's not top of the list. The biggest drivers of biodiversity loss are basically
*  what we call direct exploitation or food production. So that's stuff like overfishing,
*  that's stuff like deforestation or logging for wood, that is driving deforestation for food
*  production, that's conflicts with livestock. So it's really food production that is the biggest
*  driver of biodiversity loss by far. And again, climate change, I think, will grow in the future,
*  but it's currently not the biggest for it. So this is one of these areas that really bothers
*  me and I struggle with how to talk about almost it all. The reason I think that the climate
*  movement doesn't emphasize the role of beef and the role of dairy is because it is just insanely
*  unfathomably, lethally unpopular to do so. There's a reason the right is always accusing the left of
*  wanting to ban hamburgers. And the left does not want to ban hamburgers. And in fact, most people
*  I know who worry about climate eat hamburgers and eat steak and all the rest of it. But at the same
*  time, of the things you could do that would one, have a pretty significant effect on emissions,
*  on deforestation, on biodiversity, and I think not totally incidentally from my perspective,
*  animal cruelty. So there's something here where this is really, really, really, really big linked
*  across a bunch of our problems, and yet totally politically untouchable. I'm just going to put a
*  question mark here and just ask you how you think about this. So on this, I'm just way more optimistic
*  about the energy transition than I am about the food transition. Overall, you know, people might
*  have some biases towards what energy source they like. Ultimately, they just want cheap energy
*  coming out of the plug. And if you can give them that, they're not that bothered. That's not the
*  same for food, right? People are actively making decisions about what they eat three or four times
*  a day, and they really care about what they eat. And they will push back if you try to tell them
*  what to eat. So even on my work and messaging on this, I do a lot on highlighting, you know,
*  this is the environmental footprint of different foods. In the book, I write, you know, if you want
*  to reduce your carbon footprint from your diet, this is the best way to do it. And cutting back on
*  beef is ultimately the number one thing you can do. But I'm also super careful not to say, you
*  should do this, or you have to eat less meat, because I just know that as a communication
*  strategy, it won't be effective and people will push back in the other direction. The easiest way
*  to get someone to increase their consumption of something is to tell them not to do it.
*  So I don't have a good answer to how we actually achieve this, just to say that I think this will
*  be much more challenging than, for example, the energy transition. It's so interesting, though,
*  because it's so technologically simple compared to the energy transition. I mean, on the energy
*  transition, we're having to figure out how to get all of these electrons we generate in other ways,
*  and replace them with these like space age, you know, we're going to do what they do in stars,
*  and create nuclear fusion, right? We're going to, you know, harness the power of the sun,
*  we're going to use a nuclear reaction. And here it's like, you could eat something different,
*  you could shop in just like literally any other part of the grocery store. But it gets at this
*  truth, I think, across this whole transition, which is that the problems are not nearly as
*  technological as they are political and cultural. And maybe to add one other complication here from
*  the animal suffering side, I think a lot of people in the animal suffering and animal rights
*  movement worry about this. Because I've known many people who see this data and decide to give up red
*  meat, right? They decide to give up beef. But from the animal suffering perspective, that's very,
*  very, very bad. If you substitute with chicken, or fish or other smaller animals, cows are known
*  for living better lives, even in industrial agriculture than say chickens. And a family can
*  eat a chicken in a night, it takes them, you know, a year to eat a cow. So in terms of the
*  total numbers of animals that you are killing or raising in very difficult conditions, cows mean
*  fewer of them. So there is also this other difficult tension of, well, you don't want everybody
*  to substitute into these other animals, but then people don't want to be told to become vegetarians.
*  It's a genuinely very hard political problem. No, and I think the trade off between animal
*  welfare and environmental impact is a really underrated one. I mean, I wrote about this
*  previously, an article in Wired where I think the title was something like, should we kill trillions
*  of animals to save the planet or something? And it was getting at the heart of this where the amount
*  of chickens you would need to kill to produce the same amount of beef is just, you know, orders of
*  magnitude lower, despite the fact that, you know, it would have a lower carbon footprint and a lower
*  environmental impact. And that's just a naughty and hard to grapple with tension between these
*  two outcomes. I actually wish I had said more about this in the book. I think my dietary habits have
*  actually changed in the last few years because of this tension where I had very much motivations
*  that were just about environment and climate. So I cut out red meat, I mostly cut out dairy,
*  and I'd sometimes eat some chicken and fish because they have a relatively low carbon footprint
*  compared to other meats. But in the end, I just couldn't handle the tension with the animal welfare
*  question, which is one, the number of animals that you have to kill to produce the same amount of
*  beef. But also, to me, just the welfare standards of many of these animals is worse, right? Like for
*  me, just a chicken packed into a cage or a barn, you know, just seems to have a lower standard of
*  living than a cow in a field, even if it has a much, much lower environmental impact. So I couldn't
*  handle that trade-off and that dilemma. So I opted out and went completely vegan. But it is really
*  hard to communicate this to people. And my approach to this is to give people good information
*  and then hope that they then make the right decision for them. But I'm not going to pretend
*  that this is going to move very quickly because I don't think it will. If you just did imagine a
*  world where everybody listened to Hannah Richie, just like, we're not going to do beef, there's too
*  much of an impact. How much land would suddenly be available for rewilding or the other kinds of
*  things we might imagine that land doing? So if the world shifted to a fully plant-based diet,
*  which to be clear, we're very, very far away from. But if we did that, we could reduce global
*  agricultural use by 75%. So we basically shrink global agricultural land to a quarter of what it
*  is today. And you could feasibly feed everyone on that land. I always just find this astonishing.
*  I think people imagine human land use and what they think of is humans. We think of where we live,
*  we think of where we build buildings. But actually just a huge amount of that land is just raising
*  cows for humans. That's what we're talking about here actually in terms of the human land footprint,
*  raising cows for us to eat or drink their milk or consume their cheese.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think you're really set on the cows. I think I just say in general,
*  food production, but you're right that by far the biggest land user there is cows. But you're right,
*  the land footprint of humans is really not about where we live or where we build stuff.
*  Urban land area is about 1% of global land, maybe a few percent if you add in stuff like roads and
*  other infrastructure. But you're talking about a few percent for where we live and nearly half
*  of habitable land for the food that we eat. Ultimately, the land footprint of humans is
*  very much what we eat.
*  One thing you talk about at the end of your book is the way in which being a good environmentalist
*  by the numbers sometimes makes you feel like you're being a bad environmentalist in your actions.
*  And you talk about this as the natural fallacy, that there is this tendency to believe the things
*  that feel natural, cooking on a wood burning fireplace, or getting all your food from within
*  10 miles often do not actually align with what the data tells us is environmentally sustainable.
*  Do you want to talk through that feeling a bit and sort of how you've resolved it in your own life?
*  Yes, I think many of the things that we assume to be green or feel are green, when you actually
*  break down the data, the alternatives are often better. And I think the conflict there is that we
*  see natural as good and synthetic as bad. So if you take the example of food, what seems good to
*  us or natural to us is a nice picture of a cow in a grass field. And especially if it's from a local
*  farm, right? That seems like just the lowest way possible to produce that food, right? You're not
*  growing crops on crop lands, you're not transporting the food very far. And compare that to,
*  for example, a meat substitute that's grown in a lab or produced in a factory where you're using
*  loads of energy for the processing, it's coming and packaging, you're putting in lots of ingredients
*  and chemicals, as people would say, that seems really bad. And the beef in a field, or a cow in
*  a field seems really, really good. And then of course, when you break down the data, the emissions
*  from the meat substitute burger are just vastly, vastly lower than the beef. So many of our
*  gut instincts on this are often very, very off. And as I say in the book, this often makes you feel
*  quite bad as an environmentalist, and you will get pushback. You'll get pushback on, for example,
*  the local food story, where people just assume that the best way to reduce the carbon footprint
*  of your diet is to buy locally, even if that is beef. And if you're buying a product that's
*  been shipped in from the other side of the world, they assume that that has a very high carbon
*  footprint, and therefore that's a very bad thing environmentally to do. When you break down the
*  emissions of those two things, the vegetarian product that's shipped in probably has a vastly
*  lower footprint. Even if you think about your living conditions, the picturesque, someone living
*  in a rural area, they've got their own little farm, seems much more green than being packed
*  into a dense city with lots of cement and concrete and noise. But when you compare the carbon
*  footprints, the dense city living will just give you a much lower carbon footprint. You may not
*  even need a car. If you do, your driving distances will be much less. It's much more efficient to
*  build infrastructure and to get goods to you if you're in a dense, depopulated setting. It's
*  way more efficient to set up heating networks or power networks. So there are a bunch of
*  environmental benefits to city living, but it seems very out of sync with what we'd imagine
*  green living would be in the past. So I've done most of the things that would reduce my personal
*  carbon footprint. I live in a building in a dense urban area. I'm a vegan or mostly vegan. I slip
*  up here and there, but I travel by air. And either I don't go see my family in California
*  or I am emitting that carbon. My view on everything we're talking about with cattle and
*  with sheep and with goats. And so I do think there is this question between the places where the only
*  answer is abstention, which is a very, very hard form of politics. The places where the answer is
*  substitution, which is a much easier form of politics, particularly when the substitutes are
*  good, right? Moving to electric vehicles is much more possible now because the electric vehicles
*  are very good. And the issue where we believe we might be able to invent a substitute, but we
*  haven't done it yet. My view on the issues of meat is that until we figure out the whole cell-based
*  meat thing people are trying to work through, which is going slowly, it's not like we're going to have
*  affordable meat replacements tomorrow where people can eat the meat they want to eat without
*  the animals being nearly so involved. We're not going to solve that. Yeah. I mean, on the beef
*  question, I'm with you. I'm very pessimistic that most people make that switch to existing products
*  that we have. And I think my pessimism around that behavioral change pushes me towards a
*  technological fix where we can literally produce a like for like substitution for beef. And I
*  think ultimately in the end, we'll be able to do that, just not in a very, very short time scale.
*  My concern with some of this is that we have some fantastic technologies to address some part of
*  our emissions pie. So primarily electricity and road transport. We now have very, very good
*  solutions for those. We have them. We need to build them really, really quickly, right? We just
*  need to build, build, build, build, build. And my concern often when people talk about aviation,
*  cement, steel, et cetera, is that there's almost this pullback of, you know, we need to wait until
*  we have all of the solutions to all of the sectors before we can get going. And I think a key point
*  for me is that we need to do both at the same time, right? We need to build the stuff that we
*  have and is already very, very good. And we need to invest in innovations and sectors that we don't
*  have. And in some of those, I'm actually quite optimistic that in the next decade, some of these
*  solutions come online. But the key thing is not to get discouraged that we don't have all of the
*  solutions now and let that hold us back from deploying the technologies that we have. And we
*  urgently need to roll out. This is to me something that has actually changed and it is required to
*  change in our politics. It is happening right now, but it's very messy, which is, you know,
*  for a lot of the history of the environmental movement, we didn't have good substitutes.
*  And to get some of these problems to a point where they were being ameliorated, we had to get people
*  to stop doing things or we had to sort of add new technologies to things we're already doing,
*  like the scrubbers for sulfur dioxide. And now we have this capacity to substitute with solar
*  panels and wind and electric vehicles and heat pumps. And it requires a huge amount of
*  construction, transmission lines. And so you have this movement and this politics that for a lot of
*  its life was about trying to get human beings to do fewer destructive things and now needs them
*  very rapidly to do far more constructive things. And that's actually new. That actually is a change
*  from the dominant answer we had to environmental problems in the 70s. And the fact that it's messy
*  and difficult is a little bit to be expected. I mean, moving from an environmentalism of stopping
*  things to environmentalism of building things is almost reversing the polarity of an entire political
*  sentiment. No, it's not simple. But I think it also makes me more optimistic, mostly because I think
*  individual behavior changes really hard. And there are a bunch of studies that would support
*  that shifting people's behaviors on stuff like climate, it's just really, really difficult to do.
*  If we were relying on that to get out of this climate crisis, I would have very little optimism
*  about our ability to do so. People always frame me as a kind of techno-optimist, but I think I lean
*  that way because I'm just more optimistic about the substitution effect rather than a stop doing
*  this effect. But I think you're right that it is a massive change. A point I make regularly now is
*  that many of the big solutions we need we have. And we have solar, wind, electric cars, etc.
*  They're good solutions, they're now really, really cheap, and it's just about building them.
*  And often they get the pushback of, well, yeah, we've had the solutions for decades now,
*  and we just haven't done anything. To me, that's just really, really not true. We haven't had cheap
*  replacements for fossil fuels for decades. This is really a change in the last five years. It's
*  only in the last five years that low-carbon technologies have now become competitive or
*  undercutting the cost of fossil fuels. This transition was just not feasible 20 years ago.
*  Of course, you can argue that countries should have been investing more in these technologies
*  20 to 30 years ago so we would get to the position faster. And I agree with that. But to me,
*  it's just not true that we've had these solutions just sitting there ready to build
*  for decades and decades and we just haven't done anything. We're in a fundamentally different
*  position going forward. When I get called a techno-optimist, my answer is always that I'm
*  not a techno-optimist, I'm a political realist. And the desire for material prosperity is
*  the strongest driver in politics, particularly for anybody under a certain level of material
*  prosperity. And I just don't believe that there is a political tendency strong enough
*  to overcome the desire for a better life now to avert consequences in the future.
*  And so in my writing about climate change 10 years ago, I was extremely pessimistic.
*  And it was only the shatteringly fast drop in solar wind and battery cost that has made me
*  relatively more optimistic. But that's only to say that if you begin from the perspective,
*  and I do begin from it, or at least I've concluded it, that there isn't a politics here that is going
*  to work, that is a politics of sharp and near-term sacrifice. The politics here somehow has to
*  align with people's desire for a better life, a more prosperous life than the one they currently
*  lead. And that as that becomes more technologically possible, the politics become more possible in
*  lockstep. And to the extent that is technologically not possible, as in the case of say meat, or as in
*  the case currently of cement, the politics are not possible. We're not going to get people to stop
*  eating beef. We're not going to get people to stop using cement. So I don't really want to have all
*  my chips in on inventing solution after solution to the problems that human beings create. But
*  I don't really think there's a choice. No, I think I've ended up in a similar position.
*  It's often framed as this kind of iron law, where if you put up climate mitigation against either
*  energy security or energy cost, energy security and energy costs will win every single time.
*  And that's just the harsh reality of this. And therefore, if we want to make progress on climate
*  change, then what's really key is that we line up this long-term incentive of climate change
*  with short-term incentives. And short-term incentives are primarily about cost and quality
*  of living. And if we can't manage to offer people a better vision of future of what that would look
*  like, then I just don't think you will get the political backing, especially on both sides of
*  the aisle. You want this across the entire political spectrum. If you don't get that,
*  then you won't get the support that you need for climate action. But I think the key thing is that
*  they are now lining up. They weren't lining up 15 years ago, but they are lining up now. And I
*  think going into the future, they will get closer and closer together.
*  I think that's a good place to end. So then always our final question. What are three books
*  you'd recommend to the audience? So my first book is called Factfulness,
*  and it's by Hans Rosling. And anyone that knows my work or knows our own data will know that we were
*  massive fans of Hans Rosling, and it was a big inspiration to me. And he was really the first
*  person that got me into looking at the world through data and really zooming out to understand
*  what was going on. And his book, Factfulness, looks at the long history of many measures of
*  human wellbeing and global change, but more importantly, gives 10 key rules or pitfalls
*  that guide you into how to understand the world, how to understand data, how to understand the
*  information ecosystem and how that shapes your thinking on the world. So it had a profound impact
*  on me and I hope it does on you as well. My second pick is a book called Possible by
*  Chris Goodall. Now he is a UK energy analyst. And what he does in this book is looks at the solutions
*  that we need in so-called hard to abate sectors on climate. And I think when people hear hard to
*  abate, they think impossible to abate. And really the key point of Chris's book is that it will be
*  hard, but it's possible. And he breaks down cement and steel and aviation and plastics, a long list
*  of these troubling sectors, and just looks at the hard data on what solutions do we potentially have,
*  how much electricity or energy would we need, how much might it cost, what companies are working in
*  this space. So for me, it just gives a very, very clear-eyed vision of the set of sectors that we
*  need to tackle and what our options in this space might be. It's not prescriptive. It doesn't say we
*  have to do this or we have to do this. It just lays out very, very clearly these are the options
*  that we have. And for me, it made me more optimistic that we will get there. And then the final book
*  for me is called Range and it's by David Epstein. And it's really a book looking at this contrast
*  between specialists and generalists. And a key point of the book is that really the world needs
*  more generalists. I think we have a lot of specialists and we absolutely need specialists.
*  We won't get anywhere on any of these engineering problems or climate problems without specialists.
*  But we also need generalists that can somehow sit in the middle, pull these different pieces of
*  complex problems together, sit in the middle of different disciplines. So whether that's
*  research and communication or research and policy and be able to incorporate a wide range
*  of disciplines and inputs and then somehow drive that to change in the world. So I think my takeaway
*  from that is that we need a bit of a better ratio of specialists in the world to generalists.
*  I can see why you like that book given that I think that's something you do very well and
*  you do very well in this book. And it's the connections you're able to draw here between
*  different domains of environmental disaster that ends up being so powerful. Hannah Richie,
