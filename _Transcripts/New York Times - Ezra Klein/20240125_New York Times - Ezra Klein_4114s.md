# ‘The Strongest Democratic Party That Any of Us Have Ever Seen’
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [January 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj1lYIXfInA)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  So a bit of housekeeping ahead of today's episode.
*  We are hiring a column assistant for me and Tracy McMillan Cottom to do fact checking,
*  research, clerical work.
*  It's great entry level role and you can find it by clicking the link in the show notes
*  here or going to NYTCO.com slash careers.
*  So I've done a couple episodes recently on the Republican Party and we wanted to follow
*  that up with a couple different views on the Democratic Party.
*  And I think for Democrats, the core question that I get asked, that you hear asked is,
*  why are Democrats letting this unpopular 81 year old president run again?
*  I think it's worth stepping back and asking if you were a politician in the Democratic
*  Party who'd wanted to run against Joe Biden, what would you have run on?
*  One theory of how you would challenge an incumbent president would be you would say he's a bad
*  president.
*  But actually Biden has passed a ton of critical legislation, Democrats, the Inflation Reduction
*  Act, the infrastructure bill, chips and science.
*  The economy is doing pretty well.
*  The labor market is really strong.
*  Inflation is coming down.
*  So it's kind of hard to run saying Joe Biden has done a bad job being president.
*  I mean, there are important differences now increasingly on foreign policy.
*  But if you think back eight months ago, that wasn't as true.
*  The other way you could have run against Joe Biden is to say the guy's a loser.
*  He's not going to be able to win.
*  And the crucial moment for that, I think, the way to think about why Biden in the end
*  did not face so much pressure that he either had to step aside or face a set of serious
*  primary challenges is that in 2022, Democrats did not get wiped out.
*  And more than did not get wiped out, they won.
*  They did much better than you would have expected.
*  They gained in the Senate, they gained in state legislatures, they gained in governorships.
*  They did lose the House, but they held down losses.
*  And I always thought that if Democrats got wiped out in 2022, there really would be primary
*  challenges.
*  And because they did so much better than expected, there wasn't really room for them to get off
*  the ground.
*  There wasn't a critique to be made of Biden's Democratic Party.
*  It wasn't obviously losing elections.
*  It wasn't failing to govern.
*  So how are you going to attack it?
*  That doesn't mean that Democrats have made the right decision, but I think it is crucial
*  context and context that is often lost in thinking about why Democrats are making the
*  strategic decisions they're making.
*  There is this difference between how Democrats are polling and how they are performing.
*  But the Democratic Party is a complicated thing that no one player really holds power
*  over.
*  And so I wanted to take it from two very different perspectives.
*  And I'll say, even as we go into these episodes, I don't fully agree with either theory of
*  the Democratic Party.
*  But opposite ways of thinking about something can both carry important truths or at least
*  things worth thinking about.
*  And I wanted to begin then with perspective that gets heard less often, but I think explains
*  more in terms of how the Democratic Party is actually acting, which is that if you look
*  at elections rather than polls and look at governance rather than vibes, Democrats are
*  not doing that badly.
*  It's actually a little hard to make the case that is a party making huge mistakes.
*  They definitely don't look like a party in crisis.
*  So for this show, for the more optimistic perspective on the Democrats, I invited strategist
*  Simon Rosenberg on the show.
*  Rosenberg has been in Democratic Party politics a long time.
*  He played a key role in Clinton's 1992 election victory.
*  He founded and was a longtime head of the New Democrats Network, which was an influential
*  think tank that at times has been pushing Democrats in more liberal and in more moderate
*  directions.
*  It was very early in trying to build a stronger Hispanic strategy for the Democratic Party.
*  And he became kind of famous again in 2022 for accurately predicting that there would
*  not be a red wave, that the belief that Democrats are going to get destroyed was not going to
*  prove to be correct.
*  Now, he's the author of the sub stack Hopium Chronicles, where he is trying to offer Democrats
*  this constant argument that they're way too down on the party.
*  And actually, they have a lot of reason for hope and work to do, sure, but that they need
*  to understand they're coming to this from a strong position.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein show at NY times.com.
*  Simon Rosenberg, welcome to the show.
*  Ezra, it's great to be here.
*  So when I looked at polls at about this point in the cycle in 2016, Trump was trailing a
*  bit.
*  When I look at polls at this point in the cycle in 2024, he's roughly even with Biden.
*  I mean, it depends on the poll you look at.
*  He's maybe ahead, maybe behind, but stronger than he was.
*  And most Democrats I know are freaking out about those polls.
*  So why aren't you?
*  Because since Trump unveiled himself as MAGA in the 2017-2018 cycle, we just keep winning
*  elections, right?
*  We won the 2018 cycle.
*  We won the 2020 cycle.
*  We won in ways that people never thought we would in 2022.
*  And in 2023, which I think has not gotten as much coverage as it should have, there
*  was a blue wave all across the country.
*  We won in all sorts of Republican places and flipped seats and ballot initiatives all across
*  the country.
*  And when you just look at that as a political person, right, that's exactly what you want
*  a political party to be doing.
*  We're winning all kinds of elections, right?
*  Democrats keep overperforming in elections.
*  Republicans keep underperforming and struggling.
*  And we even saw it just this week.
*  In Iowa, despite Trump's strong victory, turnout there was abysmal.
*  I mean, they had 186,000 people voted in 2016.
*  Only 110,000 people voted this time.
*  Trump only got 7% of all registered Republicans voted for Donald Trump in Iowa.
*  It's a terrible number.
*  And so when we actually go vote, we just keep winning and they keep losing.
*  And so I go into 2024 feeling really good about where we are.
*  Look, we have a lot of work to do, Ezra.
*  I'm not sitting here and telling you everything is great.
*  We got a long way to go.
*  But if we run a good campaign and execute well, I think we're going to win this election
*  by high single digits and make this election a clear repudiation of MAGA, which will hopefully
*  start to loosen this dark grip on the Republican Party.
*  So you and I have known each other a long time, but I think you've had a burst of renown
*  in politics after 2022 when you're one of relatively few people out there saying this
*  is not going to be a red wave election.
*  Democrats are going to hold on much better than people think.
*  And that's more or less what happened.
*  They won seats in the Senate.
*  They won governorships.
*  They won state legislatures.
*  They held down losses in the House.
*  You've made the argument based on what we can see in data about the 2022 election that
*  there were really two elections in there that had different dynamics.
*  What were they?
*  I think it's sort of very foundational to understand where we are today.
*  And so in 2022, there were two elections.
*  There was a bluer election inside the battleground and a redder election outside the battleground.
*  Inside the battleground, where Democrats turned on their big campaigns, we were able to actually
*  not just do well, but we got to 59% in Colorado, 57% in Pennsylvania, 55% in Michigan, 54% in
*  New Hampshire.
*  Those would be extraordinary performances in a good year.
*  And this was supposed to be a bad year for us.
*  We were supposed to be the party that was the red wave was going to wash all across
*  the country and wipe us out.
*  And so we did extraordinarily well where we were contesting Republicans, in many cases
*  these Trumpy Republicans that were nominated in these states, and where the issues of abortion
*  and democracy were on the ballot.
*  And we actually gained ground against all conventional wisdom outside the battleground
*  where we didn't have these big campaigns, where we didn't control the information environment
*  and push our turnout to the upper end of what was possible.
*  We actually lost ground in New York and in California.
*  And it's one of the reasons we lost the House in 2022.
*  And so to me, the admonition is, where we run our big campaigns, we do really well.
*  When we go head to head with Republicans and the grassroots of the Democratic Party is
*  focused, we keep winning.
*  But when we don't run those campaigns, it reminds us of the power of the right wing
*  noise machine and their politics, which is still formidable.
*  And we can in any way discount the significance of their ability on a daily basis to dictate
*  the daily discourse in the United States.
*  And so we need to, in 2024, we need to get much more focused as Democrats about being
*  loud and trying to close that, what I call the loudness gap with the right in order to
*  be where we want to be in 2024.
*  On a pick up on a few questions and counter theories there.
*  So one, you said something interesting, which is that in these battleground areas, Democrats
*  controlled the information environment, they ran their campaigns.
*  I read it differently, which is to say that in those battleground environments, what actually
*  happened is that Republicans controlled the information environment and ran their or MAGA,
*  actually, in many cases, control the information environment and ran their campaigns.
*  And that is an extraordinary counter mobilizing force for Democrats.
*  Something you said there, I think is really important.
*  I don't think people quite realize there was Democrats in New York and California who lost
*  the House by not coming out.
*  So those were not huge MAGA elections.
*  Those were not elections people felt had a big sense of weight to them.
*  And because they then had low turnout, Democrats gave up seats.
*  But in the battlegrounds where MAGA candidates were a mobilizing force for Democrats,
*  Democrats did great.
*  And so there is a theory of the Democratic Party right now.
*  Michael Bud Horzer, the former AFLCA political director, kind of makes this argument that
*  it's an anti MAGA coalition, that it is turn itself into a vessel to stop this other political
*  tendency and where that tendency is on the ballot, it rises and where that tendency is
*  not on the ballot, it struggles.
*  Does that track for you?
*  Yeah, I mean, the anti MAGA theory is something that I actually promoted very heavily in 2022
*  during the time where I was battling the red wave.
*  And I think there is an what I often said during that time was there was an anti MAGA
*  majority in the country that we saw show up in 2018 and 2020.
*  And so the question is, would it show up again in 2022?
*  I mean, I wrote a piece in the fall of 2021, saying that I thought this would be a close
*  competitive election and not a wave election because of this, because there had been,
*  the Republicans have made, in the grand scheme of politics, when you have a politics that loses
*  twice in a row as it did for the Republicans in 2018 and 2020 MAGA, that is, usually a
*  party runs away from that politics because it's failed and they lost elections and they
*  lost the House, the Senate and the presidency in those two elections.
*  The Republicans didn't do that.
*  They ran right towards MAGA.
*  They doubled down.
*  They became super MAGA.
*  And that's, in my view, an enormous strategic error that is continuing through today.
*  We saw this play out not just in 2022, but in 2023.
*  It's already playing out in early 2024.
*  I think MAGA is even unattractive to Republican voters.
*  And I think the Republican Party is splintered.
*  What's interesting for me about this is that if you watch cable news, if you watch MSNBC,
*  a third of the contributors and a third of the people on TV are former Republicans
*  in some form or fashion.
*  We've never had that kind of abandonment or splintering of a modern political party in
*  our lifetime.
*  Yes, MAGA is deeply unattractive.
*  And my argument is that Trump and MAGA are even more unattractive, more dangerous, more ugly,
*  more extreme in 2024 than they were even in 2022 and 2023.
*  And so if this has been a failed politics in all these elections, they continue to double down
*  on it, then I think it's why I'm so optimistic about what we're going to be able to do this year.
*  But let me flip part of that dynamic on you.
*  You made the point.
*  You often see these former Republicans on MSNBC, which is true.
*  And there is a slice of the Republican Party, the Democratic Party's begun to win over,
*  which is these more educated, higher information, which these folks are, of course, at the apex of.
*  And the argument you will hear from people who are a lot less sanguine about this than you are
*  is that Democrats have been outperforming in 2018 and 2022 and 2023 because they've won over a kind
*  of voter that used to be Republican and is more likely to come out in a lower turnout special
*  election, more likely to know what's going on, show up at the polls.
*  But in a presidential election where you get a lot more kind of unusual voters, where you get a
*  lot more low attachment voters, Republicans are doing stronger numbers among some of those
*  factions. And it's not like Donald Trump saw his number of voters collapse from 2016 to 2020.
*  More people voted for Donald Trump in 2020 than voted in 2016.
*  It's just even more people than that voted for Joe Biden.
*  But it was close enough that a shift in the wins could lead to Joe Biden winning the
*  popular vote by 2.5 points and losing the presidency. So there is no margin here.
*  Well, listen, I understand the theory and it's a theory. It's not actually played out in practice.
*  It could happen in 2024. It might be what happens, but it hasn't happened.
*  The theory is that, you know, all this, the fact that Democrats just keep winning everywhere
*  in red states and blue states and ballot initiatives and off-year elections and
*  special elections isn't going to translate over into 2024. And yet when you look at what's
*  happened when we've gone to the general election since 1992, Democrats have won more votes in seven
*  out of eight presidential elections. No American political party has done that in our history.
*  It's the best popular vote run for a political party in American history. And in the last four
*  elections, we've beaten the Republicans on average by 51 to 46, right? A five-point gap.
*  The last time Democrats averaged over 50% of the vote in four consecutive elections was during FDR's
*  presidency. And so we're in the midst of our best presidential run that we've been on since the 1930s
*  and 40s. And this idea that somehow something's going to happen in this election that has not
*  happened in seven out of eight of the previous presidential elections and isn't happening across
*  the states, it's a theory of somebody who doesn't really work in politics every day,
*  because that's not really how politics works, right? There isn't one set of dynamics that
*  are playing out again and again and again all across the country. And then all of a sudden,
*  everything dramatically shifts. And so I know this could happen. I understand the theory. A lot could
*  happen. A meteor could hit the earth tomorrow. I don't think it's going to happen in 2024 for all
*  the reasons that we discussed earlier about the counter mobilization against MAGA,
*  which is still the most powerful force in our politics, far more powerful
*  than disappointment in Joe Biden and the Democrats.
*  Matthew Fosk So I have this experience sometimes when I listen to you, because it's very persuasive
*  on one level. And then I also have this kind of like, wait, but like I've just been living
*  through this other thing happening, which is there is no such thing in the American political system
*  as a popular vote presidential election. The only thing that matters is the electoral college.
*  I am old enough to remember Donald Trump winning the electoral college in 2016. It feels very fresh
*  as a wound. I'm also old enough to remember that he had a Republican House and Senate then.
*  Democrats did win that back in 2018. Although they did well in 2022, they did lose the House,
*  right? There is a Republican speaker now. In fact, there have been many Republican speakers
*  since Democrats lost the House in 2022. Republicans control more governor's mansions. They control
*  more state legislatures. There is a lot of truth to this. And so as a corrective, I buy it, right?
*  There is a tendency, I think, to see Donald Trump and MAGA as this unstoppable political force.
*  And the polls are now feeding a kind of panic about that among Democrats. But also, to listen
*  to you, you're describing a dominant political party that is wielding power continuously.
*  But Republicans have the Supreme Court, they have the House, they have the governorships,
*  they have the state legislatures. Democrats have the presidency and the Senate. I would not say,
*  well, the Democratic Party is an obviously dominant party on the historic run of success.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, I mean, I don't agree.
*  Pete Slauson But what don't you agree with?
*  Pete Slauson Don't discount the importance of a
*  popular vote, right? I mean, we're in a democracy and winning more votes than the other side is the
*  core of what a campaign is about. I mean, are we in a democracy though?
*  Pete Slauson Well, I mean, this is-
*  Pete Slauson Oftentimes, we're not.
*  Pete Slauson I know. And I've written about this extensively. And you and I, actually,
*  the last time that you and I actually really connected was actually over this issue, right?
*  About how our power is appropriated in the United States and how, you know, you can be a party
*  winning elections by five points and still not be in power. Right now, I just want to remind your
*  listeners that, you know, people say the popular vote doesn't matter in a general election. Of
*  course it does because there are tons of down ballot races below, the Senate and House races
*  all across the country. And so, you know, winning an election by four or five points,
*  of course it matters, right? Because there's all these other elections happening too. And so,
*  both can be true, right? You want to both win the popular vote and you want to win the electoral
*  college. So, I, what I look at, and the reason that I am talking the way that I talk about this,
*  is that what's happened to a great degree is that we've had a couple bad elections where
*  Republicans have run up the score. And it's one of the reasons why they've maintained
*  so much political power around the country. But on balance, where I'm satisfied with our
*  performance is that, you know, for a party that when I got into this business back in the late
*  80s and early 90s, where the Republicans were on this incredible presidential run,
*  the Democratic Party in the late 80s and early 90s was getting wiped out at the presidential
*  level. And the reason that the new Democrats came about was to reverse that and was to create
*  a competitive national party again. And since 1992 and Clinton's presidency, we've won more votes,
*  seven out of eight times. And yes, two of those elections, we didn't win the electoral college
*  and they won the presidential election. But the goal was to make us competitive at a national
*  level again, when we weren't. I mean, this idea that at some point, the Democrats used to be really
*  strong and have sort of fallen down. The exact opposite is true. We used to be really weak and
*  we were getting killed in national elections. And now we're not. In fact, we're in the best
*  popular vote run that we've been on, you know, since the FDR's presidency. I can see Joe Biden's
*  path for victory as a strategist, right? He's been a good president. He's going to have a strong
*  case for reelection. We keep winning elections all across the country. Trump, to me, is a much weaker
*  candidate than he was in 2016 and 2020. I don't know how you dress this guy up, Donald Trump,
*  and make him look like a serious candidate for president again. I just don't think it's possible.
*  And part of the reason why is not just because he's more extreme and more dangerous than he was,
*  and MAGA is more of a threat to the country, but his performance on the stump is far worse
*  and more wild. And so when I look at somebody who's been doing this for over 30 years,
*  what I see is a really crappy presidential candidate. And I think we're going to kick his
*  ass. You know, you're a strategist and you see a path to creating victory for Joe Biden. So if
*  you were running that campaign, what's the approach? What's the message? What would you
*  be telling Joe Biden to be doing, saying, emphasizing? We're going to have a hard time,
*  I think, in the day-to-day information war. What Trump still have and what the Republicans still
*  have is they're much louder than we are. Just his ability to dominate the daily news and to give us
*  very little space to make our case. And I think this is also exacerbated by Joe Biden's age and
*  this is where his age is not an asset. I think in general, his age is an asset. It's made him
*  a strong president. But I think it means that as somebody who grew up in politics in the war room
*  in 1992, which was really about reinventing the way that information and media is done in a
*  campaign and how you contest the information space every day, the theory of the campaign in 92,
*  coming out of the loss of Dukakis, is that we had to contest the information space every day.
*  Then any attack that was made, if we didn't rebut it or counter it, it would stick.
*  We were very on the front foot. We were fighting with incredible intensity.
*  The Biden communications operation, to me, has a slightly different understanding of all this,
*  which is that they believe there are things that are never going to amount to anything that's
*  going to matter and they can kind of ignore them. And I just don't agree with that. And I don't
*  agree with that from having been in this game for a long time. I was a guest on Fox News for 17 years
*  and did thousands of appearances on Fox. I mean, I've been in this thing pretty deeply for a long
*  time. And I think if my greatest advice to the campaign is that there has to be a tempo
*  and an expectation that they are fighting with unbelievable ferocity and intensity every day
*  in the information space in order for us to control the information environment and to allow
*  us to win. And that's, to me, the most important thing that we need to do in the coming months.
*  I don't think they're ever going to do that. And let me try an analogy on you that's been in my
*  head, which is that Trump is a street fighter. His theory of the information space is out of a
*  street fighter. He's going to punch at it and hit it with a pole as hard as he can till it crumples
*  beneath him. And Biden and his team going back now some years, and I think this might be somewhat
*  mediated by their own concerns about him or what he's willing to do and not do, but whatever it is,
*  they do Aikido. They try to let the other person create the energy and use it against them.
*  I actually think the one thing Donald Trump and Joe Biden agree on is that Donald Trump should be
*  in the news every day and Donald Trump should control the information space. Look, getting into
*  the news, this is my profession, is not a mystery if you're the president. You announce things that
*  are significant enough. You say things that are conflictual enough, or you do things that are
*  unexpected or outrageous enough. Donald Trump does all of them constantly to the extent that
*  he can. There's a reason he's showing up at all these hearings and getting in arguments with the
*  judges. He wants that covered on the news. If Joe Biden and his team believed it was good for them
*  or wanted to or believed Joe Biden was good at being in constant fights with Donald Trump,
*  they can unload on him day after day after day after day. I think their view,
*  and this has been my sense of them for some time, is that it is good for them when Donald Trump
*  dominates the news because, again, it's a counter-maga coalition. It's an anti-maga coalition.
*  As long as you have some maga figure driving the story day after day after day, that will
*  ultimately counter-mobilize the Democrats. The counter-mobilization of the Democrats is larger
*  than the mobilization of the Republicans. That is, I think, what they're trying to do. I'm not
*  saying it's my preferred strategy, but that's my read of them. I think you're exactly right, by the
*  way, completely. I talk to them all the time, and I'm close to both the campaign and the White House.
*  What I don't mean is getting in his face every day. Democrats have to feel the campaign. They
*  have to feel us fighting. They have to feel the intensity, because part of the reason we've been
*  winning so much is because of this counter-mobilization. The counter-mobilization
*  isn't just with voters. It's with our activists. There is a massive new democratic political machine
*  that has grown up organically in recent years. It was very accelerated during COVID
*  when these new technologies allowed remote activity. One of the remote activities is Zoom.
*  What's happening now is that there are hundreds of thousands of Democrats who are listening to
*  people like me over at Zoom and campaign people and other folks, democratic politics,
*  every week on Zooms, where they have this far more intimate relationship with politics than they
*  ever used to have. What's happening is the counter-mobilization is also providing our
*  campaigns more money than they've ever had in our history. We're building unprecedentedly large
*  campaigns with the biggest field operations we've ever had. There are more volunteers to fit into
*  those campaigns than we've ever had before, because you can now not just export your money
*  out of California, you can export your labor. Yesterday, we won this race in Orlando, and I
*  spoke to Fenris Driscoll, who's the state house leader for the Democrats who I worked with very
*  closely on this race. She said, at the victory party, Simon, a woman came up to me and said,
*  I'm here. I drove two hours to be with you and do GOTV, because Simon asked me to go help you guys.
*  So what's happening is this counter-mobilization has created the strongest democratic party than
*  any of us have ever seen. It's why when I wrote in the fall of 2021, as I said, because of all of
*  this, we had more tools to mitigate midterm drop-off than we've ever had before. I felt
*  that we were going to be able to use that to have a good election in 2022. Well, that huge machine
*  just played a major role in winning an election in Orlando, Florida that nobody in Florida thought
*  we were going to win. We flipped the state house in Virginia just in November, which none of the
*  political operatives on the ground thought we were going to do. And we keep doing things that we
*  didn't think we could do. We keep performing at the upper end of what's possible as Democrats
*  because of this machine, this counter-mobilization you're describing. And I think it's just going to
*  be too big and too overwhelming for Donald Trump in 2024, because it's independent of any candidate.
*  It has nothing to do with who's running. It's not connected to an ideology. It's the simple thing.
*  Democrats are going to save the country. Republicans are dangerous. And you've got millions of proud
*  patriots who love their country, who are fighting to make sure their democracy doesn't slip away.
*  They have nothing like that.
*  So I want to go back to the question I asked you about Biden and his path, because when I said,
*  what would you tell them do, you said fight. But I actually meant to ask something closer to what
*  should this be about? One thing they want to make it about clearly is Donald Trump and MAGA and
*  democracy. You go to Biden's big speech a couple of weeks ago about democracy in January 6.
*  They're in many ways running against Donald Trump, almost as if Trump is an incumbent.
*  But Joe Biden is the incumbent. And you go back to 2020 and how they ran then. They ran against Trump
*  and he was the incumbent. And they ran against the pandemic. They ran against the Trump
*  administration's pandemic operation, which at that point was completely flailing.
*  And right now there is no pandemic at that level that is dominating politics. Obviously,
*  there's a lot of COVID going around. Donald Trump is not the incumbent. And the bigger problem Biden
*  faces, I think, is widespread voter dissatisfaction with the economy, which is somewhere where I do
*  think polls are important. I don't believe polls are predictive of elections this far out, but they
*  are reasonable snapshots of public opinion and people are not happy with the state of the economy.
*  And when you ask them who they trust on it, they say they trust Donald Trump. So in terms of what
*  the Biden administration should be saying about itself in the election, what should they be saying?
*  Well, listen, they've made it very clear based on that speech in Valley Forge that they believe the
*  sort of foundational contrast is Joe Biden protecting democracy and Donald Trump trying to end it.
*  And it's a pretty powerful argument. It's actually been working pretty well all across the country.
*  And it's also true, right? I mean, it has the virtue of being true. And we know from polling
*  and market research that we all do that creating a narrative about who we are around freedom
*  is incredibly powerful. And this has been heavily tested by lots of different people.
*  And it's how we've been running, frankly, in these elections that we keep winning. And so I think,
*  first of all, he's on the right track. I mean, this is a very good early orientation.
*  I do think there's also going to be an element of the campaign that's about, you know, making the
*  case that he's been a good president and then rolling out, which I assume is going to happen
*  this day in the union, his second term agenda. And these things are also going to matter a lot.
*  I'm a little bit more optimistic than you are about our ability to sell his economic story,
*  because I don't think the country is down on the economy. I think that Republicans are.
*  And if you look at Democrats and the people that are available to us and the people who we have to
*  talk to to get to win the election, they actually give Biden very high marks on the economy. And
*  they think the economy is doing really well. I think this is one of these polarized issues
*  that we just like the Biden approval rating. I don't think it's nearly as descriptive as
*  people think it is. So I think we can make progress there. I don't know that we're going
*  to catch up with Trump on the economy, but I think we there's a lot of ground we can make up
*  this year once the campaign really engages. And so your point is-
*  I want to stop there for a minute, because I think it's actually very important and is a big
*  question for me in the election. I'm not pessimistic or optimistic on their ability to sell
*  an economic message. What I do think is true is that I spend time looking at the consumer sentiment
*  data. I spend time looking at the polling here. I spend time looking at the various indicators we
*  have of how the economy is doing and how people are feeling about it. And what looks both like
*  a huge opportunity for them to me and a genuine problem for them to me is that there is a gigantic
*  delta between what the economy looks like and how people feel about it. If you were just running
*  this through a statistics machine, Joe Biden's record looks fantastic. Like you want to be Joe
*  Biden created a huge number of jobs. Unemployment is extremely low. Wage gains have been very strong.
*  Inflation was up, but now it's down. We are outperforming European economies that kind of
*  look like our superficially. Like if you wanted to be-
*  You sound like me now. Ezra, you sound like me now.
*  But this is just the economic facts, right? Like a campaign is an effort, right? To tell a story.
*  We have a serious affordability crisis in my mind, specifically in housing and a couple other
*  things. But that's been going on for a very long time. But in the economic data, it looks very
*  strong. This is the data you would want as the raw material to tell a story. And whatever they're
*  doing to tell the story or not tell the story, it is not working. Elections are also about
*  the public perception. They are not just about people reading the Michigan Consumer Sentiment
*  Index. How do they close that gap?
*  So number one, just like what happened in 2022, where everyone thought we were going to lose
*  because there was low Biden approval and high inflation, and we ended up having a really good
*  election, despite the disappointment with the economy that you're describing, we keep winning
*  everywhere. Because going back to the thing that you said in the beginning of the interview,
*  is there's a force in our politics that's more powerful than disappointment in Joe Biden and
*  the Democrats, which is the fear and opposition to MAGA. That's the thing that's been driving
*  our politics since 2018. And it's going to drive the election in 2024. The second thing is,
*  you're right, a campaign is about putting information into people's heads that they
*  don't have. Right? I mean, that's the core of what you do in a campaign. That's why advertising
*  exists, right? Is you're moving narratives and stories that you need, that people need to hear
*  that they may not totally understand. Look, part of what's a challenge now,
*  there isn't one information environment in the United States. There are at least two,
*  and there may be even more. But Republicans are living in a completely different information
*  environment than Democrats are, or the non-MAGA, non-Republicans. And in the non-MAGA
*  information environment, the economy is actually doing well. People are happy.
*  No, wait, I want to push you on this because I know where you're going.
*  I can show you tons of data on this.
*  Yeah, but I know the media environments very well. And what I would say is, yes,
*  there's a very MAGA information environment. There's also like, obviously, a more liberal
*  information, right? But most people are not in really either one of them. Most people just
*  don't read that much news because the news makes you feel bad. And people have other things they
*  want to do in their lives. They get the news ambiently. And I want to say extremely clearly,
*  I think that is a perfectly reasonable life choice to make. Right? Like that is the way human
*  beings mostly operate. Lives are busy. They have other things they want to focus on.
*  I always say that the biggest divide in the news is not left to right. It's interested,
*  uninterested. The news is fundamentally a hobby. I can look at the polling on how people feel about
*  the economy and I can tell you the number of people dissatisfied is significantly larger,
*  multiples larger than the number of people watching Fox News to say nothing of watching
*  or absorbing smaller than Fox News conservative outlets. So I don't want to just give that all
*  to the news. No, I'm not going to give it all to the news, but I just let's just go to data,
*  right? Because I think that one of the things you were saying earlier is that there are,
*  we have to distinguish when we talk about these things, particularly here in your kind of setting
*  between things that are true and things that people believe because they're not the same.
*  And it's really important in a time of rising untruth that we don't give up on the idea that
*  there is an objective reality out there. And the objective reality is the country's far better off
*  than when Joe Biden came to office in the midst of COVID, a huge recession, insurrection, and all the
*  other things that were happening. And that's why I believe that over the course of this election,
*  he's going to be able to make the case that he's made the country better, which was his primary
*  goal as president. And he's got a strong agenda for the second term, right? But I go back to this
*  basic idea of you look at polling and in polls, high quality, large interview polls on the economy,
*  Democrats are giving Biden very high marks on the economy and believe the economy is doing really
*  well. There is a huge divergence in the universe that we have to talk to that's available to us
*  because 40% of the country is not available to us. We have no ability to reach them.
*  People are not nearly as down on the economy as the overall numbers are. They just aren't. I mean,
*  this is clear as day. When you look at these other measures, life satisfaction, job satisfaction,
*  income satisfaction, right? Life satisfaction numbers are up in the 70s and 80s. Job satisfaction
*  numbers are up in the 60s. Income satisfaction are in the 50s, right? And if you look at the
*  Axios poll that they released just the other day on questions of how are you doing, not how's the
*  economy doing, the numbers are way up in the 50s and 60s. And so what it means to me is that we can
*  make significant progress on this issue. We may not catch up to Trump, but we can't expect to have
*  the election we want to have if we're trailing Trump on the economy by 10 points. And so we've
*  got work to do here, but to your point, we have really powerful raw material to make the argument.
*  And I think television advertising and a real campaign where we're prosecuting this stuff
*  every day, I'm optimistic we can make progress because it's true. And the things being true does
*  matter in a campaign. It's easier to win arguments that are true than to win arguments that aren't
*  true traditionally in a campaign. It's not always the case, right? But usually the case. So what we
*  have to do is doable in traditional politics. The things we have to do are doable. The things they
*  have to do, I don't think are doable. I don't think that they can take this guy, because let me make
*  one basic point about Trump, which we haven't talked about, is that the question was asked of
*  Iowa voters, Iowa Republicans, if he is convicted of a crime, would you view it as a disqualifier
*  for him being able to run for president? 30% of those voters said it would be a disqualifier.
*  If you want to talk about a blinking red warning light about the potential for the Trump candidacy
*  to collapse and for us to have a route in the election, the data is there if you want to look
*  at it. The second data piece on this NBC Sunday poll with Des Moines Register, Haley voters,
*  20% of the Iowa electorate, were asked in the poll, would you vote for Trump or Biden in the
*  general election? 43% said Biden, 22% said Trump. I mean, these are crazy numbers. I mean, if we get
*  40% of the Haley voters, we're going to be getting up into the 50s. Now, I don't think they'll all
*  come with us, but there is incredible clear data from this past week that Trump is a deeply troubled
*  candidate and that he could easily go into the general election as the most wounded, degraded
*  candidate that we've seen in the modern era. You worked for Bill Clinton. You were in the
*  Barack Obama Democratic Party orbit. And both of them, I think, are interesting here. If you
*  go back to their midterm elections, they got stomped, absolutely stomped. Under Clinton,
*  Democrats lost the House for the first time in 40 years. Under Obama, the Democratic Party just got
*  annihilated in 2010. And they both looked fairly weak. Obviously, Joe Biden had a better midterm
*  than they did. And he's pulling a little bit behind where they were, which people can interpret
*  it in different ways. But what lessons do those politicians have for him or the Democratic Party
*  now? What can Joe Biden learn from what Clinton and Obama did to then win reelection?
*  Both of those campaigns started much earlier than the Biden campaign has. You know, Clinton was an
*  incredible politician and was in the game every day and led his team loose early on in 1995.
*  We really set the terms of the debate early, which really, you know, we ended up winning reelection
*  by eight points. I mean, it was an enormous victory in 1996. And Obama, same thing. I mean,
*  the campaign was much further along than where the Biden campaign is now. And so, to me, the urgency
*  of the moment is they've got to just accelerate the development of the campaign. Campaigns are
*  organic things. They grow. You know, it's like building a battleship, right? You can't do it
*  overnight. You can't just flip a switch and a campaign turns on. You have to hire people.
*  And some people don't work out. And you try tactics. And they don't work. And you've got to
*  learn from it. And you've got to keep reiterating all the time. And this is why I'm talking about
*  the need for them to engage more frontally in the day-to-day battle. Because we've got to go through
*  an accelerated process of getting this thing into a general election, day-to-day general election
*  mode. We have a very short window here now. I mean, the general election is really beginning.
*  I mean, it's now. Trump's won functionally. And we're in the general election. I think Trump is
*  going to start attacking Biden much more frontally very soon, I would imagine, even with his ads and
*  in terms of their day-to-day engagement, because he doesn't really have any opposition
*  in the Republican Party anymore. And I think the campaign isn't really ready for that right now.
*  And so to me, the most important thing is Biden world needs to accelerate the development of the
*  campaign. I think a lot, as a lot of people do, about the role Joe Biden's age will play in the
*  campaign. I mean, you look at polling, Biden's age is the number one concern voters have about him.
*  But then I've been trying to think about what is that concern at its core? Because something
*  you'll hear people say, I've said something like it. I think he's been a pretty good president,
*  not that I wouldn't argue with some things he has done. But I think economic outcomes are looking
*  strong. I think his management of a lot of foreign policy crises has been very stable, very steady,
*  the ability to build international coalitions has been very impressive. The congressional
*  dynamics have been very good. They've gotten a lot of big legislation passed. That said,
*  I think two things emerge here. One is that organizations reflect their leaders. That is
*  a truism across any organization you can think of, businesses, campaigns, everything.
*  What you were saying about Bill Clinton, about Barack Obama, about the energy of it,
*  Clinton being out there immediately after the loss in the midterms, Barack Obama
*  right beginning to try all these grand bargains and super negotiating committees and just
*  endlessly out there showing that he's trying and Biden hangs back. I think his organization,
*  not strangely, predictably, has this quality of him. There is a lack of energy to it because
*  there's a lack of energy at this point to him, which I do think is age related. I followed Joe
*  Biden for a long time. This is not something I would have said about the Joe Biden of 2000 or
*  2008 or 2012. That's one dimension of it. The other dimension of it that worries me is that
*  I think at a very fundamental level, and this is going to be reflected in a piece I'm working on,
*  the Democratic Party has become the party of normalcy, almost like the conservative party
*  in a more philosophical way. The party that is saying, we are going to keep American democracy.
*  We are going to have relatively competent people in the relevant positions doing the things they
*  are supposed to be doing. It's not democratic socialism. It's not intense around different
*  forms of identity anymore. Under Joe Biden and in relationship to MAGA, the Democratic Party,
*  at least for this moment in American politics, is the party of normalcy. The one problem with
*  that for them is that Joe Biden is himself somewhat abnormal. He is just older than we've ever seen
*  in a president. In terms of that promise of stability, of consistency, the promise that on
*  an emotional level is a party saying to everybody, look, those people are nuts. We've got this. We
*  have the people who can just keep us under control. Then people see Joe Biden and he doesn't project
*  that command to them. Command is a performance. It's a sense of what people are capable of. It's
*  energy. It's not just outcomes. That feels to me to be where right now I look at his age and I see
*  it actually affecting things. I think that he hangs back in part because of whether they don't
*  think he's an effective messenger or he doesn't or he doesn't want to. I don't know. It just reflects
*  something now in him that is now we're seeing it in the campaign. I think this fundamental thing
*  they want to say, which is we are the party of people you can trust and they're the party of
*  people who God knows what. People worry about his ability to do this and they've not even tried,
*  as best I can tell, to answer that. You could imagine things they could do, but they are not
*  trying. Those things concern me. I was listening very closely to what you were saying because I
*  think it's very nuanced and you've obviously, you're writing a piece about it, so you've been
*  thinking about it and I think it was very well articulated. Let me try to respond. I do think
*  that we have to litigate the age issue in this election and the way that I tell Democrats all
*  the time, we have to run towards it, not run away from it because it really matters. It's front of
*  mind for voters and we can't pretend that it isn't. I think we have to make the case that
*  as somebody who's formerly young myself, that when you get older, you not just lose a step,
*  but you also gain wisdom, experience, and capabilities and that that wisdom, experience,
*  and capability have been central to his success and that his success as president
*  is actually because of his age, not despite of it. I do believe that we're going to have to invest
*  a lot of money and energy in explaining why the first term was successful. He offered to do one
*  thing in the first term, which was to get us to the other side of COVID effectively and he has
*  and he needs to own that, I think, and to make it clear that you made me president to do this thing,
*  I did it. We're on the other side. I think that he's going to be able, I think, to make a very
*  clear argument that you asked me to do something, I did it. I got two more big things I want to do
*  with all of you together. If you elect me, we can do those things together and may continue to make
*  progress. This next set of challenges have to be grounded, I think, deeply in this fight for
*  democracy domestically and abroad. And I also think climate change is this other existential
*  fight that's in front of us. And so I do think there's a way to address all that. But the other
*  part of what you said is that I do think the communications burden of this election is going
*  to fall much more on the campaign than is traditionally the case. I mean, think about
*  the difference between running a campaign for this Joe Biden and running it for Barack Obama
*  or Bill Clinton, who are two of the best communicators in modern American history.
*  It means that the campaign has greater responsibilities. And so it means that the
*  ability of the campaign to execute the team that's in there, their strategies, their day-to-day
*  operations, their mobilizing, what I've called for is a reinvention of the war room, right? This is
*  part of the new way we have to be thinking, which is the war room in our mind's eye is 20 sweaty kids
*  drinking Red Bulls, you know, producing TikTok videos. And what we need the war room to be now
*  is two to three million people who are networked into the campaign, amplifying the good works of
*  Joe Biden and the Democrats to redesign a campaign so that the campaign itself is louder, is taking
*  on more communications responsibility, acknowledging everything that you're describing,
*  right? It has to do more and be better than most presidential campaigns have had to be in recent
*  years, which is why, you know, we needed to get going, right? It needs to accelerate its growth.
*  But look, you're raising really important issues. I think these are all things that can be managed.
*  They're not unmanageable in a political context. I think fixing Donald Trump and making him look
*  like a presidential candidate is not something that is manageable. I want to talk about some
*  trends inside the Democratic Party that stretch before and beyond Joe Biden. And the big one is
*  the changing composition of the parties. So it's, I think, cliche at this point, known to say that
*  Democrats have gained higher income voters, lost working class voters. I'll put some numbers to
*  that. In 1968, 52% of white people who never attended college voted Democratic. In 2020,
*  only 35% did. You look at voters of color, Donald Trump improved his margins among particularly
*  working class Latinos between 2016 and 2020. Democrats did not hugely roll that back in 2022.
*  So even if Democrats can win elections with this sort of emergent higher income, you know,
*  more educated coalition, why are they losing working class voters? And what can they do about it?
*  I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but I'm pretty sure that Biden won voters under
*  $100,000 in 2020. Yes, but by less than Democrats used to. And that's consistent across elections
*  going before Biden. I think, but this is important because we're not losing working class voters. We
*  actually won working class voters in 2020, right? And because of the strong performance with
*  Hispanic and minority people of color working class voters. And yes, some of the margins have
*  been cut a little bit and we'll see if that happens again in 2024. I mean, I think 2020 was
*  a highly unusual election because of COVID. More Hispanics had to work in in-person jobs,
*  fewer had health insurance. And I think the shutdown Democrat argument against Biden
*  in 2020 that Trump made actually was material and it's still material today in our politics.
*  Because I think for some younger working people, Biden got on the other side of opportunity for
*  them. And whereas Trump was the guy fighting to make sure they could continue to earn a living,
*  right? And to feed their family. And that for Biden, the shutdown argument, I think is lingering
*  and as part of his brand that we've never really been able to fully overcome. And I think it's
*  particularly important for people of lower socioeconomic status who needed to work every
*  day in order to feed their family, right? Who had no reserves. We have a more acute problem with
*  white working class than we do with the overall working class. And the erosion that's taken place
*  the so-called erosion that's taken place with Hispanics and African Americans, I don't think
*  is as great as some have argued. And let me make my case for this is that on Hispanics. And as you
*  know, this has been an area that I've been a pioneer in, in working with the Hispanic community.
*  I mean, I did the first bilingual poll ever done in the Democratic party and produced the first
*  Spanish language ads back 20 years ago. And part of where I think a lot of the analysis and the
*  Hispanic vote has gotten completely wrong is that it's not factoring in the growth of the population.
*  And so if you get 65% of 100, that's 65 votes, right? But if you get 63% of 200,
*  you have more, you know, smaller piece of a bigger pie, you still get more pie.
*  So in the Southwest, in the heavily Mexican American parts of the United States,
*  Democrats are far stronger in every state than they were 20 years ago. We are burying the
*  Republican Party now in the Southwest and in California. And we're even getting reasonably
*  close in Texas, and we can't do it against Abbott. But in the other elections, we've gotten
*  reasonably close. And so I think things are not nearly as dire as some folks of my colleagues in
*  the industry have represented in my view. I feel like this is a little bit confusing
*  things through statistics, or at least taking statistics that tell you different things.
*  I take your point on the bigger pie, smaller percentage is still more pie. Nevertheless,
*  if you keep losing percentage, eventually you get less of the pie. And so there's an erosion here,
*  right? We watched it with Democrats with the white working class. I mean, you could have said that
*  for some time. It's like, okay, well, they're still winning the white working class, they're
*  still winning it up. Now they're not winning it, but it's close enough. And now, and so something
*  is happening here, whether you buy all of educational polarization or not. I'm on record many
*  times saying I think educational polarization is tracking something else and what people think it
*  is tracking. It is some kind of referent for class. And I think there's issues of cultural
*  representation there and whether or not people feel respected and other things happening.
*  So I don't love the educational polarization conversation, nor am I going to completely throw
*  it overboard. I'm with you, by the way, can I endorse your interpretation of that?
*  Wonderful. I appreciate that. But you know, you are seeing very and I take your point on the
*  southwest. But again, if Republicans begin closing that proportion gap, eventually they're going to
*  close the election gap too. But they're not this candidate, Donald Trump, this candidate can't do
*  that. Maybe he can. Well, I don't know. I mean, I would not have expected if you had told me from
*  2016 to 2020, for all the messaging, the Democratic Party and the sense that like what Donald Trump was
*  doing was destroying the Republican Party forever among voters of color, but maybe winning over these
*  racist whites. Actually, what happens is that Joe Biden wins the election because suburban whites
*  move over to him, even as they suffer very surprising defections among voters of color in
*  different ways. And so I think you should take more seriously than you are, or I would at least
*  like to get you to answer the question from the perspective of somebody who takes more seriously,
*  that Democrats understand themselves to be the party of the working class. And even if they do
*  have a majority now among voters making less than 100,000, that is they are increasingly reliant on
*  a different kind of voter. And that is both a question for building a bigger majority, right?
*  At some point, you got to start winning back some of these working class voters, if you want 55%.
*  It's also a kind of spiritual moral identity question, right? If you're the party who your
*  whole thing is that you are trying to make things better for working class Americans, and you are
*  losing your margin among working class Americans, I think you should wonder what is happening here.
*  So if you were to buy that, what would you say is happening here?
*  Yeah, no. So I want to be clear that I think also to get granular on the data, right? I think we're
*  seeing more erosion with working class men, right? I mean, I think that also may have to do with
*  Trump's machismo and his- Yeah, that's closer to my theory of it.
*  Yeah, no, no. I think that that's very real because it's not just people of color. There didn't used
*  to be such big gender gaps in black and Hispanic communities. And now there's starting to be
*  significant gender gaps, which the abortion issue in the Hispanic community is exacerbating.
*  I'm not dismissing this at all. We have to be concerned about the erosion you're describing,
*  but we also have to be careful to be accurate in understanding what is actually happening.
*  And yes, if we keep eroding, if we keep seeing a diminishment of our vote with Hispanics,
*  some of the margins we have will be diminished, but that's not what's happening. I want to be
*  clear, right? I mean, we are doing better in Arizona, in the parts of the country with heavily
*  Mexican-American populations than we've ever done. I mean, where I find one of the people who make
*  this argument, really, to Sarah to be so comical, frankly, is that his book is called, you know,
*  Where Have All the Democrats Gone? And yet we've just gotten more votes in the last four presidential
*  elections than we've gotten since the 1930s and 40s. We're actually doing better nationally than
*  we've done since he's been alive. And the idea that we're losing things as opposed to gaining
*  things net is just not the right way to look at all this. Our coalition's changing, right? We have
*  to adapt to it in part because their party is changing. And I think we have to be open and to
*  do what you're describing, which is we have to really study this stuff and come to an understanding
*  about how do we build majority coalitions. And so I hear you on the spiritual piece of this,
*  and I think that we have work to do here. Look, I want to be very clear. I'm optimistic,
*  but we have a lot of work to do. Big chunks of our coalition have wandered from us right now,
*  and we've got work to do to get them back. Largely young people, people of color, right,
*  are wandering from the Democratic Party right now. And if you look at polling,
*  they're not wandering into being non-voters. They're wandering into third party options for
*  now. And so we're going to have to contest with these third party candidates. We're going to have
*  to go in there and fight it out. Joe Biden's not going to just have to run against one candidate.
*  He could be running against four altogether. But I'm confident that we have a strong enough
*  argument. And if the campaign is strong, I'm confident that we'll be reasonably successful.
*  Aaron Powell He made this point that there were distinctive
*  dynamics in 2020 around COVID that might have really cut Democrats' margins among Hispanics.
*  I think that the possible analogy to that this year is young voters in Israel. And I'll be honest
*  that two months ago, I wasn't taking this that seriously. I kind of figured it would blow over
*  an American polling. And that may still very much be true, you know, when you think 10 months into
*  the future. But when I look at the polling now, it does seem very real to me. This is something that
*  emotionally is very real to the people following it, which if you're on social media, you're one
*  of them now, you know, more often than not. And I'm curious how you take that, the possibility of
*  a fracture over foreign policy between Biden and young voters who he very much needs to turn out,
*  who did turn out in 2022, but that was before this war.
*  Joe Biden Yeah, I mean, who turned out in 2018, 2020,
*  and 2022, right? I mean, we've had very, very strong historical performance with young people
*  in recent elections. Would a foreign policy issue like this become a top tier voting issue for
*  any age cohort in the country in a general election that's going to be about so many other
*  things, right? It would be unusual for that to happen. And for the marginal 25 year old young
*  voter in the United States, the idea that in November, Israel Hamas will be more important
*  to them than their job or healthcare or democracy or abortion or climate or guns, it's unlikely that
*  that's the case. I think there is though, however, an influential small group of young people who
*  this is going to be a top tier voting issue, and they're very organized and they're very loud,
*  and they're going to be part of what we have to deal with. And it's one of the reasons why I've
*  been very aggressive about trying to get the youth oriented part of this campaign up. And what I hope
*  is that we're going to see the most sophisticated, most well-funded youth campaign that we've ever
*  seen in modern American history. I think the Biden team has to do this. I don't think they
*  really have any choice. I think we're going to do really, really well with young people. We're going
*  to do particularly really, really well with young women because of abortion and all the issues.
*  I think we've got to start really treating the gender gap that's growing in the youth,
*  which is connected to some of the other things we've talked about today, is something that has
*  to become more understood about what's happening with young people. I mean, many, many young women
*  are just not available to Republicans anymore and may never be for the rest of their lives,
*  by the way. I mean, I think this abortion extremism that we've seen, which we haven't really
*  talked about very much today, is the kind of thing that could cause the Republicans to lose
*  elections for a generation. I mean, it is one of the most extreme policy outcomes in American
*  history, stripping rights away from more than half the population. What happens with men is going
*  to be we're going to have to contest that more. I think that some of the allure of Trump's machismo
*  and his kind of Joe Rogan-ish positioning has been attractive to a lot of young men,
*  and I think we're going to have to go in and fight it out with young men in a way that's going to be
*  very different from young women. One of the reasons I think it's important to look at the shifting
*  composition is that parties have to adapt. I mean, you said this a minute ago, have to adapt to who
*  is actually in them, and when you do that, it shifts what you can say, what you can do, right?
*  I mean, this is very true for the Republicans. I mean, we can talk about the Democrats all day.
*  The fact that Republicans have to adapt to being a MAGA coalition and have to say things that only
*  the people in MAGA agree with, like the 2020 election was stolen, is a real problem for them.
*  For Democrats, there is a, I think the concern, and you see it if you read Rui's book,
*  you could see it if you read my colleague David Lee and Hart's book, which is a more sort of economic
*  take on this. His book is called Ours Was a Shining Future, and it's a, I think, a very deep look at
*  some of these issues. And the argument is that the Democratic Party, as it has become more connected
*  to these higher income, more educated voters, has begun to reflect their concerns more, right? So
*  emphasize things like environmentalism, abortion, things like that, that were certainly tough for
*  abortion before DOBS. But I think behind that is also reflect their cultural taste more.
*  I think one of the things that happens with the educational polarization conversation
*  is people want to look at it as materialism, but it's partially a question of class representation.
*  That's something Donald Trump and some Republicans are increasingly good at is saying to people who
*  feel like they're on the outs of American life, whether they really are or not,
*  I see you, I like you, you're great, these other people are terrible, you know, they're elites
*  looking down on you. And the Democratic Party is losing the kinds of voters, it seems to me,
*  that don't like a vibe within the Democratic Party, right? You know, they like the consumer
*  protections, right, but they're not really that connected to politics. So calling up the policies
*  from one side or the other is not really how they think about politics. But they look around
*  and they see a party led by people who they don't think would like them if they met them,
*  right? The most important question in politics is not, do you like the candidate? But do you
*  think the candidate would like you? And that's the vulnerability here that if these dynamics
*  persist, we're not just talking about vote totals, we're talking about what a party feels like to
*  people, because it reflects who has power in it. As the Democratic Party is more and more people
*  with literal power and society inside of it, it reflects that that turns off people who feel on
*  the outside of that power structure. And that also just creates a very combustible kind of
*  polarization in the country. That is, I think, my deeper concern about this set of things,
*  not that you can't imagine an electoral winning coalition, but you can imagine feedback cycle
*  effects in terms of what the parties are, that is not great for the country, not great for them,
*  but also not great for the party, the Democratic Party's traditionally intended itself to be.
*  Pete Slauson There's a lot there, Ezra.
*  Ezra Pesce Sure is.
*  Pete Slauson We have to just ground ourselves in the reality that Trump has lost and the Republicans
*  have lost the 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2023 elections. And so, the loss is their loss, not our loss,
*  right? And we have to not allow ourselves to sort of get to a place where the Democratic Party is
*  in trouble or losing. I just don't, I mean- Ezra Pesce
*  But I'm not saying that. I'm saying there's other dynamics that are worth taking seriously.
*  Pete Slauson I know, but I mean, I think this notion that the Democratic Party is sort of in
*  trouble or in losing, you know, I just reject that in many of these arguments.
*  Ezra Pesce Well, what about able to vanquish MAGA, right? Not win elections by a bit,
*  not win the Senate but lose the House, not win specials by a bit, but actually destroy it.
*  Pete Slauson Well, let's see what happens in 2024. I mean,
*  I want to go back to this basic reality that I think is not present adequately in the daily
*  discourse that we all have with each other, which is that something really significant has
*  happened in the last two years, which is the party in power has actually gained seats all across the
*  country. It's an anomalous event. And so, to me, this is the most important electoral data that
*  exists, far more important than any crappy 800 sample poll that's being done out there right now
*  because we keep having a dramatic thing happen. There is a massive repudiation of MAGA happening
*  all across the country. I'm going to answer your question here in a second, but I want to start by
*  not conceding that the Republican Party is strong and winning. They're not. And so, I don't know
*  that their formula is successful. And I think what you're going to see in 2024 is a really
*  substantial and significant splintering of the Republican Party. I think the Never Trump or
*  Never MAGA form a Republican wing of the Republican Party. I mean, if we were in a
*  parliamentary system right now, there would be a new party, a center-right party that would have
*  emerged with Liz Cheney as the head of it. She'd be in our cabinet. MAGA would be down in the 40s,
*  right in the low 40s, and polling. And we would be sort of a coalition government. We can't do that
*  in our system. I do think the Biden campaign is going to have to figure out some way to do that
*  virtually. I mean, if we have Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney and Adam Kissinger and all these folks
*  campaigning for us in 2024, it's going to make a big difference. It's going to create a huge
*  permission structure for Republicans who are not MAGA, which could be up to 20% of the Republican
*  Party, by the way. We're talking about huge numbers. And I do think, going back to what you said
*  earlier, my other response to all this is that you argued earlier that we're the party of normalcy,
*  right? I mean, that we're the party that is presenting a normal face for America, a very
*  normal guy, one of the most religious presidents in modern American history, right? That the face
*  of the Democratic Party is one of normalcy and regular people, and that that's part of our goal.
*  We have investments being made in red states and red districts all across the country because of
*  Biden's huge investment agenda. We're not running away from Republican voters. We're trying to run
*  towards them and help bring them into our coalition. And so I think all, again, I go back to this basic
*  view that the things that we have to do are doable. Every party has issues. I mean,
*  you have assets, liabilities, you've got challenges and things, but I don't think we're as culturally,
*  if we were so culturally out of it, why do we keep winning elections again and again and again?
*  And so I think this has been exaggerated in my view. I think it's a problem to be managed,
*  but it's not a problem that is defining the Democratic Party. And frankly, on the issue of
*  the polarization you're talking about, that polarization has been created and fostered by
*  a political leader and by his allies in the right-wing media. And the idea that somehow
*  we're responsible for the polarization in the country right now, I think is just unbelievable
*  bullshit. Joe Biden has been a good president. He's been a good president for everybody.
*  So I stand by this basic idea that the Democratic Party is strong. We're winning elections. I'm
*  proud of my president, proud of my country, proud of my party. And I think we're going to have a
*  really good election. And I think there's obviously, Ezra, to your point, there are
*  things to worry about, things to manage, but I think on balance, things are going really well.
*  And I'm really looking forward to this election and engaging with the Republicans frontally and
*  having these arguments out in the public. Always our final question. What are three
*  books you would recommend to the audience? Yeah, these are three. I prepped for this,
*  and it was an interesting question because it was not what have I read recently, but what would I
*  recommend? And I, so three, I just finished a book called A New Deal for the World by Elizabeth
*  Borgwart. I think a lot about how the four freedom speech that FDR gave in January of 1941 was really
*  the beginning of the modern Democratic Party as we know it. And it put us on the side as Democrats,
*  and I'll just do this really quickly, is that part of my whole story that I tell is that the
*  world that we imagined and built as Democrats in the 1940s has created a golden age in human history.
*  There's never been a more, a better time to be alive in the history of the world and the history
*  of humanity than it has been during this period of Pax Americana and the world that we imagined and
*  built together. And as I tell Democrats in my talks, that we're part of the most noble political
*  enterprise that's ever existed, the Democratic Party. We've done more good for more people than
*  any other organized political entity in human history. And that's why this fight for preserving
*  that global order and making sure that people of the world, their kids and their grandkids,
*  have the opportunities that we had is so central to everything that we need to do now as Democrats.
*  We've been called before and we're being called again. The second book that I just went back and
*  have been rereading is on tyranny by Timothy Snyder. And his first chapter, which is called
*  Do Not Obey in Advance, is something that I literally think about every single day about
*  everything that I do. And it's a very powerful articulation of how we can't yield to the
*  authoritarian narrative story impulse. We can't self-censor and that we need to create our own
*  reality and stay in our own reality and not yield to what they want us to do. I think this is so
*  central. It's a central operating principle, I think, for Democrats and for people who are
*  pro-democracy in the United States now. And then the third book, a little bit less weighty, was,
*  you know, I'm a big fan of Daniel Silva's and his latest Gabrielle Wong book, The Collector,
*  something that I just recently, I finally got to, had been sitting on my bedside for months.
*  And I just love his books.
*  Simon Rosenberg, thank you very much.
*  Thanks, Ezra, for what you do.
