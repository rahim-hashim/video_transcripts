# Pete Buttigieg's Thoughts on Playing JD Vance
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY)
*  Ted Cruz had Ted Cruz's personality in 2010 too. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=0.0s)]
*  He was not well liked by his colleagues. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=4.04s)]
*  Marco Rubio is much friendlier to Trump now, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=6.44s)]
*  but same sort of guy temperamentally. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=8.94s)]
*  JD Vance has, it's like went through a temperamental overhaul. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=11.32s)]
*  He became angrier and resentful and contemptuous of people who disagree with him. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=16.2s)]
*  How do you understand, as you're one trying to absorb his temperament, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=22.84s)]
*  because I'm sure you're trying to prepare Tim Walls for that, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=25.54s)]
*  but you're trying to understand it, what do you make of that? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=27.72s)]
*  I've certainly seen a lot of Republicans, especially my generation's Republicans, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  go through some version of this evolution. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=36.28s)]
*  Although you're right, I think it's more dramatic in his case. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  But I think sometimes we make these things way more complicated than they are. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=42.32s)]
*  I think there's a bunch of people, including him, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  who know deep down how bad Donald Trump is for the country, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  realize that they could gain power by attaching themselves to him, and they did it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8eRdWCFaWY&t=50.120000000000005s)]
