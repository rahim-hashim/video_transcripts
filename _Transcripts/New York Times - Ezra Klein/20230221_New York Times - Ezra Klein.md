# This Book Changed My Relationship to Pain
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [February 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZdtrY8NuUc)
*  I'm Ezra Klein.
*  This is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  So maybe it's that I'm in my 30s now.
*  Maybe it's that I have kids and I'm always picking them up and pulling them out of car
*  seats and bending down.
*  Maybe it's my constant habit of emotional repression.
*  I'll come back to that one.
*  But for the past couple of years, I've had a lot of nasty neck and back pain.
*  And I've sought all the normal remedies and experts, doctors and sports medicine doctors
*  and chiropractors and x-ray technicians and physical therapists and masseuses.
*  I got an ergonomic chair for the day, a standing desk, and I got a neck bolster at night.
*  And what I'm totally certain of is none of these people have any idea what is going on with me.
*  And I'm not telling you this because it's interesting, although I appreciate it because
*  I want your theories.
*  I'm telling you because it's been all roughly 20% of American adults,
*  about 50 million people suffer from chronic pain.
*  For most people, that just means bad days.
*  Now and again, a couple of days laid out in bed.
*  For some, it means constant suffering, the narrowing of the horizons of life.
*  And for too many, it's meant opioids, it's meant addiction, it's meant overdoses.
*  And spend even a few minutes talking to people about their pain experience.
*  Or for that matter, as I have looking at the studies tracking treatment success.
*  And you'll realize that when it comes to chronic pain, we do not understand what is behind all this.
*  And we are not good at treating it.
*  So I've become interested in what we understand about pain, what is happening at the frontiers
*  of pain research and pain thinking.
*  And somebody who's sitting there is Rachel Zofniss, who is a pain psychologist
*  at the University of California at San Francisco in their School of Medicine.
*  And she's the author of the Pain Management Workbook,
*  which I would recommend to anybody dealing with chronic pain.
*  I found it revelatory.
*  But her core argument is a pain and practically chronic pain.
*  And this is all built on reams of research.
*  It's never just a biomechanical phenomenon.
*  It's never just something that exists in your shoulder or your elbow or your hip.
*  Pain, of course, is made by the brain.
*  And it also arises importantly, and this is particularly true for chronic pain,
*  in a social context, it responds to where we are and who we're with
*  and what is happening around us.
*  I sometimes run into books like this.
*  You have a book that claims to be about one topic, maybe a pretty narrow topic,
*  in this case, a workbook for pain.
*  And then you realize they're about something a lot bigger,
*  how our minds and our bodies and our societies interrelate and co-create our experience.
*  And what that suggests about what human beings need to live well,
*  whether you have daily pain or not.
*  As always, my email, azraklineshow.nytimes.com.
*  Rachel Zofniss, welcome to the show.
*  Azra Klein, so cool to be sitting across from you.
*  What is pain?
*  Pain is the body's warning system.
*  It's our danger detection system.
*  And, you know, I'm a nerd, capital N, and I've always been a nerd.
*  And I remember taking neuroscience at Brown as an undergrad.
*  And I had this wonderful professor, Mark Baer, I think he's at MIT now.
*  And he was explaining pain to us.
*  And he explained that there are some people who are born with such an extremely high pain threshold
*  that they don't really feel or experience pain.
*  And I remember thinking, that sounds so wonderful.
*  And then he went on to say, and those people don't live very long.
*  Because if you think about it, you go for a run, you break your leg,
*  your body doesn't give you any danger messages.
*  That's extremely bad for your body.
*  You put your hand on a stove and your skin is melting off,
*  and you don't get any danger or pain messages.
*  That is very bad for your body.
*  So at the end of the day, pain's job is to protect you.
*  But there's many other things about pain that people don't know.
*  It's complex, it's subjective, and it isn't what you think it is.
*  It doesn't just live exclusively in the body, is what I mean by that.
*  So oftentimes when people have pain, like a bad back or a bad knee,
*  we are understandably convinced that that pain lives exclusively in our back.
*  But that's never, ever, ever true of pain.
*  Turns out, there's a condition called phantom limb pain, which you may have heard of.
*  What phantom limb pain means is someone loses a limb, an arm, or a leg,
*  and they continue to have terrible pain in the missing body part.
*  And what that tells us about pain and its location is that if pain lived exclusively
*  in the body, no leg should mean no pain.
*  And the fact that you can have terrible pain in your leg
*  that's no longer attached to your body tells us that pain is not actually produced
*  exclusively by the body, but rather is constructed by the brain.
*  And the treatment for that, or at least one of them, is a little mind-bending,
*  that you put a mirror up on the other leg.
*  Can you talk about that?
*  That's right.
*  You've done your research.
*  There's a couple of different proposed treatments for phantom limb pain,
*  but one of them is what happens in phantom limb pain is that your brain gets confused.
*  There's a part of your brain called your homunculus,
*  and it's a map of your entire body that lives in your brain.
*  So if I said to you right now, Ezra, sense into your foot
*  and notice if it's hot or cold and see if you can feel your foot on the floor,
*  you can do that.
*  And one of the reasons you can do that, your brain, it's complicated,
*  but one of the reasons is because you have a whole map of your body that lives in your brain.
*  So what happens sometimes, not always, when you lose a limb,
*  is that the map in your brain doesn't disappear.
*  So one of the treatments for phantom limb pain is called mirror therapy,
*  where we hold up a mirror so that the brain can sort of get unconfused and recognize that
*  the body part actually isn't there anymore and the danger messages are no longer necessary,
*  which is a slight oversimplification of what it is.
*  But again, this just drives home to me the point that when we have 15 back surgeries for back pain
*  or we see 25 knee specialists for the bad knee that we've had for 10 years,
*  we're not actually doing our job when we're talking about treating pain effectively.
*  – You write at one point that, quote, the brain makes pain.
*  And then there's this other line you'll hear in our culture, it's all in your head.
*  What is the difference between those two statements?
*  – People with pain are often told it's all in your head when we can't find particular pathology,
*  or there's like pain of an unknown etiology, which happens to a lot of us or will happen to a lot of
*  us if it hasn't already. Historically, that happened a lot to women in particular. So if they
*  had pain, or God forbid, strong emotions, they were diagnosed with hysteria and told their problems
*  were all in their head. And pain is always real. The pain we feel is always real. So there's a
*  difference to me between healthcare providers who may be well-intentioned and maybe not,
*  who say to patients, oh, it's all in your head because there's nothing on this scan.
*  And explaining that pain always involves your brain. So pain is never a purely psychological
*  problem, never ever. It's always a biopsychosocial problem 100% of the time. So we know that
*  cognitions and emotions and perceptions matter a lot when it comes to making pain. But also signals
*  and messages from your body matter too. So it's not all in your head. Your brain is a critical part
*  of the pain experience. And one of the most important things we want to talk about when
*  we talk about effectively treating pain is that you can't just go after your back and you can't
*  just go after your knee. You also have to target your brain. The message is that the brain is
*  important too. We cannot just focus on body parts if we want people to get well. And that's part of
*  why chronic pain is on the rise and not going down. So the question of what it means to say
*  pain is at least largely or in some cases heavily coming from the brain is part of what led me to
*  you. So I have neck and shoulder problems of, to me, a relatively uninteresting but quite annoying
*  variety. And when I mentioned this on the show, it must have been a year or two years ago,
*  a bunch of people all at once sent me links to books by a guy named Dr. John Sarno.
*  And eventually I had enough neck and back pain that I read them. And they're interesting. The
*  basic argument there is that you have a lot of back pain that in his view is really coming from
*  repressed emotions. And it's a way of distracting the mind from confronting something it doesn't
*  want to confront, which on the one hand didn't strike me as hugely convincing or empirical.
*  And on the other hand, it seems to have helped a lot, a lot, a lot of people who are now sending
*  me his book. So as we're into this, what do you think of Dr. Sarno's work?
*  John Sarno was a controversial and polarizing doctor. And I want to say what I like about
*  his work. And I also want to say what I don't like about his work. What I really deeply appreciate
*  is that Dr. Sarno was a well-established, well-known and well-liked clinician who came out and said,
*  emotions don't just live in your head, they also come out in your body, and they affect your health
*  and they affect your pain, which neuroscience confirms is true. So he, what I liked about his
*  work was that he was helping to bridge this gap that we have between emotional pain and physical
*  pain, and they're always connected, always. What I don't particularly love about Sarno
*  was that he sort of pretended that he was the Columbus of emotions live in the body. Like he
*  planted this white flag on land that was already populated with many decades of research and was
*  like, I have discovered this thing and I'm going to give it a name and I'm going to call it TMS.
*  And, you know, he came up with this whole treatment and he thought it was about repressed
*  emotions and there was a lot of psychoanalysis in there. It's a very Freudian theory.
*  It is very Freudian and I do not subscribe to that. And again, I don't want to dismiss what he did.
*  Like he, in my mind, he's done a great thing in medicine and he has helped many thousands of
*  people and I admire that. But the thing that I want to do is take all of this pain research
*  and neuroscience that's lived in these stuffy medical textbooks that actually we've known for
*  many decades and trotted out into the sunlight so that everyone who has pain or loves someone with
*  pain knows what to actually do about it. And by the way, for chronic pain, science says,
*  and people will be mad at me for this, science says opioids are not the effective treatment for
*  chronic pain. For acute pain, God bless. Like after you have dental surgery and you don't have a
*  history of addiction and you're not in a high-risk category, blessings. But I really appreciate what
*  Sarno did in his move to reunite emotional and physical pain, but I do think he was a little bit
*  off track. One thing I really appreciated about your pain workbook is at least for me struggling
*  with some of these questions, it gave a fairly convincing account of what is happening when the
*  brain constructs pain. And I want to quote from part of it. You write, your appraisal, you meaning
*  your mind, your appraisal of the situation is a critical determinant of the pain you feel,
*  context, thoughts, prior experiences and memories, emotions, and the meaning you assign to your pain
*  all change your experience of it. And this matches to what seems to be pretty current in
*  neuroscience, this idea of the brain on some levels, a prediction machine. You got it. Tell me a bit
*  about that. So you asked at the beginning, what is pain? And my response, you know, pain is this very
*  complex, subjective thing. But at the end of the day, your brain's job is to save your life. And
*  pain again is the body's danger detection system, your warning system. So your brain has this
*  beautiful machine, uses all available information in any given moment to decide whether or not to
*  make pain and how much because again, that's your brain's job. So if you imagine what that actually
*  looks like, your brain is using information from past experiences, it's using where you are and
*  who you're with. It's, you know, using emotions, how you feel, it's incorporating, of course,
*  sensory messages from your body and all five of your senses. And I want to give you a quick
*  story that I think will illustrate this point. So tell me the story of the two nails. Great. So
*  2007 Journal of Psychosomatic Medicine reported on two gentlemen, they were both construction
*  workers, because apparently that's the most dangerous job anyone can ever have. So one was
*  a 29 year old construction worker, and he was on a job site. And he jumped off a platform straight
*  onto a seven inch nail. And that nail went straight through his boot clear through to the other side.
*  And he was in terrible excruciating pain. And his colleagues were all horrified. And they rushed
*  him to the emergency room. And you know, he was screaming with pain and they gave him an IV of
*  intravenous fentanyl, which is a very powerful opioid, as we all know. And the good doctors
*  removed his boot. And they discovered that a miracle had occurred. The nail had passed
*  between the space between his toes. There was no blood. There was no wound. There was no tissue
*  damage. But his pain was real. How is that possible? His brain, aka his danger detector,
*  used all available information, memories of past pain experiences, knowledge of the dangerous work
*  environment, the panic that he saw on his friends' faces, this visual, of course, his five senses,
*  this visual of a nail sticking out of his boot. I also would freak out. And because-
*  I feel pain just hearing this story.
*  Yeah. And because his brain decided that his body was in danger, it made pain to protect him.
*  So second tale of nails. And by the way, of course, I like stories that rhyme. I call it a tale of two
*  nails. The second story, another construction worker was on a job site. He was somewhere in
*  Colorado. And he was using a nail gun. And the nail gun accidentally discharged and ricocheted
*  backwards and it clocked him in the jaw. And he had, you know, a mild headache and a mild toothache.
*  But he continued on with work and life for about six days. And at the end of six days, he turned
*  to his wife and said, you know, I'm going to get this toothache checked out. He went to a dentist.
*  And the dentist did a scan of his patient's jaw. And much to both men's surprise, they discovered
*  a four inch nail embedded in his face. Right. And what had happened was when the nail gun
*  discharged, he saw a nail shoot across the room and bury in the wall across from him.
*  So again, his brain, our danger detector, used all available information to determine
*  whether or not to make pain and how much. So it used this visual of this nail shooting across
*  the room and information also of this experience of having this nail gun clock him in the jaw.
*  And decided that not much pain was needed because his body ultimately was safe. And I read this,
*  like I went down this rabbit hole with these stories so far. You have no idea. I have like
*  a collection of every interview, everything. And one of the doctors who finally did the surgery to
*  remove the nail said something like, he's the luckiest man I've ever met. So again, Ezra is
*  shuddering everybody. So again, to me, what I really love about these stories is that they
*  illustrate the point, pun intended, that I'm trying to make, which is your brain is always
*  using all information, not just some information. Pain and tissue damage are not the same thing.
*  The conclusion of the tale of two nails is you can have damage to your body and not a lot of pain,
*  like a nail, four inch nail embedded in your face. And you can have no tissue damage and have a lot
*  of pain like our friend who had the nail in his boot. And we all know that this is true. Like if
*  you've ever gotten into the shower and you're like, whoa, I have a black and blue mark, how did that
*  get there? That's evidence of damage to your body without accompanying pain. Or if you're someone
*  who's an athlete, I am not, I am a bookworm. But if you're someone who grew up playing sports,
*  and you ever had like a great soccer game or a great football game, and at the end of the game,
*  you discovered that you were covered in blood and you had no idea what happened. And it was
*  only then that the pain started. You also have had that experience. All factors matter when
*  it comes to pain production and pain reduction.
*  So I think this gets at what is often, in addition to painful about pain, scary about having pain,
*  which is an assumption many of us have, that it is signaling some kind of harm to the body. And
*  you make this distinction, it's very central to the book, between hurt and harm. Tell me about that.
*  It's a critical distinction for patients to get better from pain. And by the way, I include myself
*  in that category. We have this other myth in medicine that it's us versus them. It's us as
*  providers, you know, on the right and patients on the left. And I want to say clearly, none of us
*  are going to escape pain. It's coming for everybody, whether you've had it in the past,
*  or you have it now, you're going to have it in the future, or someone you love will. Pain is
*  everybody's problem. There's no such thing as a quote unquote pain patient. We are all pain
*  patients. So there's a really important distinction between hurt and harm. And the tale of two nails
*  stories in my mind really brings that to the fore. So hurt is the subjective experience of pain that
*  you have, for example, when you stub your toe. And harm is the actual damage that occurs to your body.
*  So if you look at that stub toe and it turns purple and it's swollen, that's inflammation and
*  evidence of crushed capillaries. But it turns out that hurt and harm are not the same. You can have
*  damage to your body without accompanying pain. You can have pain without accompanying tissue damage.
*  And what has happened, understandably, is that our brain conflates the two. And that is adaptive,
*  and it's not necessarily a bad thing because it saves our life, right? Because one of pain's most
*  important jobs is to grab your attention and get you to change your behavior. So if you go for a
*  run and you break your leg and you don't stop running, your body is going to be in danger. And
*  it's pain's job to stop you in your tracks, make you go seek medical help, and then rest for however
*  long is required to heal. But the problem is, because we're so used to, you know, acute pain is
*  the more common type, and I want to define my terms. Acute pain is pain lasting three months or
*  fewer. That's how it's generally defined. And chronic pain is pain that's three months or longer
*  or quote unquote beyond expected healing time. So it's a bit nebulous in its definition. But acute
*  pain is more common. It's the pain of childbirth or the pain of an illness or, you know, breaking a
*  bone. And chronic pain is a little bit more rare. But with acute pain, it's adaptive and useful
*  to pay attention to the pain message, which again is a danger message, because there's a high chance
*  that it is warning you of potential danger or damage to your body. So, you know, if you're going
*  for a run and your body's hurting, it's good to pay attention. It's good to stop. But the message
*  here is that hurt, which is pain, the subjective experience of pain, which is your brain's opinion
*  of how much danger your body is in, is uncoupled actually from damage or harm. And I want to say,
*  I'm not saying that when you have pain, it doesn't mean there's tissue damage. It most surely could
*  mean that, but it doesn't always mean that. Well, let me use an example for this, because I think
*  it's easy to hear, say, the story of two nails and say, well, that's a freak situation. But one thing,
*  in addition to when we are harmed expecting hurt is when we hurt, we go looking for harm.
*  Oh, so true. And to quote something you say that is very striking and somebody used to
*  cover healthcare policy I ran into a lot. Studies on back pain revealed there's little to no
*  correlation between backscan abnormalities and pain. In one study, disc degeneration and bulges
*  were found in 80% of elderly patients who had no symptoms or pain. In another, MRI abnormalities
*  were found to be completely unrelated to the degree of disability or pain intensity reported
*  by patients. But what often happens to people is they're having a lot of, say, back pain,
*  and you go in and you get a scan and say, well, it's got to be that. I mean, look, it's bulging out
*  in seven places. So there's also this question of, I don't want to always call it over treatment,
*  but the assumption that hurt and harm are the same leads us to assume to go looking and then
*  possibly go solving things that aren't always relevant. I love that you read those studies,
*  because I'm a statistics person and I try, but those studies are so important in the science
*  of pain. And those of us who are down this rabbit hole with pain science, quote them all the time,
*  and I would not have remembered the numbers if you hadn't said them. So thank you for that.
*  So what happens is, and the reason we all run to the doctor when we have back pain,
*  understandably, is because for decades we've been told that pain means, to your point,
*  tissue damage and harm. And that's not actually the case. And pain is this complex experience
*  that involves our emotional health and contextual health and environmental health and social health
*  as well. But that's why we all run to the doctor. And there's a diagnosis that makes me crazy. It's
*  called failed back surgery syndrome. Failed back surgery syndrome is when a poor patient
*  with chronic back pain has done the thing they've been told by all their doctors and surgeons to do,
*  which is to just go after the tissue damage, just go after the herniations and the bulges.
*  And seven back surgeries later, they still have pain. And now there's a name for it,
*  which I find very patient-blamy. Like you failed the treatment. And it's like, no, our health care
*  providers are unwittingly, most of the time, failing patients. Because at no point do my patients,
*  my patients come to my office and I'm the last stop on the train because no one wants to see a
*  pain psychologist. Nobody trusts me. Back to the stigma and psychosomatic medicine and it's all in
*  your head. And at no point have my patients been told, by the way, pain is your body's warning
*  system. It's subjective. It's tied up in your emotional health. It's tied up in your social
*  and environmental health. And if we really want to treat your pain, we have to treat you like a whole
*  person and not just a body part. So this failed back surgery syndrome just really kills me.
*  Well, this goes back to the point about chronic pain being a less reliable guide to harm than acute
*  pain. And so tell me about this idea that the brain practices pain.
*  People often ask me, well, you know, I've had pain for five years, seven years, 20 years.
*  What makes pain chronic? How does pain become chronic? And there are multiple processes by
*  which pain becomes chronic. And one of those processes is called central sensitization.
*  Was there ever a skill that you were bad at and you practiced it over time and you got good at it
*  eventually? For me, it was piano. I was terrible at it. And my mom made me practice. And over time,
*  I got good at piano. What about you? It took me a very long time to figure out how to tie my shoes.
*  Like longer than you would think reasonable. I had a bunch of spatial reasoning issues when I
*  was a young kid. And things like that were hard for me. Now, super easy. Can do it. Can tie my
*  shoes, can tie my kids shoes, can tie your shoes. It's unbelievably straightforward. The clinician
*  me wants to ask so many questions about that, but I'm stopping myself. Great. So I'm going to say
*  this back to you in neuroscience language. We all know that the brain changes with time and experience.
*  We all know that the brain is plastic. There's this term neuroplasticity. And what that means is
*  the brain changes again with time and experience and exposure to things.
*  So the pathways in your brain are like the muscles in your body. The more you use them,
*  the bigger and stronger they get. So Ezra, if you said to me, softness, I want really huge biceps,
*  I would say that's cool, Ezra. Go to the gym or get some free weights and, you know, lift weights
*  over and over over many days. And you will see with practice and time and experience, the muscles in
*  your arms, your biceps will get really big and strong. A bunch of bros are like, you just completely
*  skipped over protein intake and caloric excess. You get so many emails about this. Oh, God, I hope
*  not. Right. And I just want to say upfront, I am simplifying some very complex processes and I'm
*  doing that on purpose. So the pathways in the brain are like the muscles in your body. The more you
*  use certain pathways, the bigger and stronger those pathways get. So for me, I mentioned that
*  growing up, I didn't really like playing the piano, but my mom really wanted me to practice.
*  So I would sit and practice and over time, what happened, and everyone who's ever played an
*  instrument knows this, eventually, my fingers just magically knew what to do. I didn't even have to
*  look at the sheet music and I could hear Chopin in my head. Like I didn't even have to listen to the
*  song to hear the music. So what was happening is that again, our neuroplastic brain will change
*  with time and practice and experience. So the piano pathway in my brain got bigger and bigger
*  and stronger and stronger the more I played the piano. Guess what happens in the brain?
*  The more it inadvertently and accidentally, and I put in quotes, practices pain. The pain pathway
*  in your brain, which by the way is not a real thing, there's no real pathway. There's lots of
*  parts of your brain that are contributing to pain in your central nervous system, but the more you
*  practice pain for the sake of this analogy, the bigger and stronger the pain pathway in your
*  central nervous system gets. And when that happens, we say that your brain has become
*  sensitive to pain. When we have pain and our pain pathway has become big and strong, what that means
*  is our finely tuned, wonderful brain is now picking up on sensory messages from the body
*  and interpreting them as dangerous and amplifying that even though they're not dangerous and they
*  don't need to. And one great example I like to use of this is with my fibromyalgia patients who
*  have chronic pain and they go to the park for a picnic and their brain gives them these loud
*  danger messages, danger, danger. And I think everyone can agree that going to the park when
*  you have fibromyalgia is not dangerous, but your brain is telling you that it's dangerous anyway.
*  And what I like about this analogy is that it really drives home this idea that pain is really
*  a danger message and the pain system is your danger detection system and it isn't always right.
*  And if you're someone living with pain and you believe that it's dangerous for you to go outside
*  and go for a walk and that it's dangerous to see friends, you are never going to get well because
*  part of the chronic pain cycle is staying inside and staying in bed and missing out on life and
*  that's understandable and a lot of people do need to do that, so I'm not saying to never do that.
*  But with chronic pain it turns out that that kind of pain cycle is the thing that ultimately
*  amplifies pain, perpetuates disability, and prevents healing.
*  So I had an interesting experience with your book over the weekend.
*  I'm dying to hear about this.
*  Because I, so I mentioned that I have, you know, neck and shoulder pain and something will happen,
*  I'll sleep weird and my neck will crick. But also a couple times I was working out and something
*  happened and I couldn't move for three or four days and it was awful. And then recently after
*  that experience, like the second really, really rough injury, which happened a couple months ago,
*  something weird has occurred and I've been scanned and poked and prodded and chiropracted
*  and nobody can find anything wrong. There's no issue as far as anybody can tell. Very small
*  things where I feel a twinge will shut me down much more than they did before. Like I tripped
*  over a cobblestone but didn't fall and just felt like the vibration in my neck and it was
*  immediate like, oh no. Or this weekend my son dropped a cookie and I bent down to pick up the
*  cookie and I just felt that, I was like, oh no. And I don't think anything is going wrong actually,
*  but I have gotten more afraid of it. And the idea that I've become more sensitive feels very true
*  psychologically that compared to where I was after a couple really bad experiences, I am more afraid,
*  I freeze up more. And in a world where part of what is happening is my mind is predicting if
*  something has really gone wrong, a world in which I am constantly wary and scanning for the possibility
*  that something has really gone wrong is a world that might help explain why this thing nobody can
*  pick up on a scan keeps becoming more sensitive and more problematic. So it wasn't good for my
*  weekend exactly, but it's extremely good for reading your book and being able to bring a lot
*  of attention to it because it felt very, sensitivity feels like what it's been.
*  You bring up a really good point which is about more than prediction, which is that emotions
*  always impact the pain we feel and what neuroscience shows is that stress and anxiety
*  amplifies pain and it turns up the brain's pain dial. So the way I like to explain how pain works
*  is if you imagine in your central nervous system, which is your brain and your spinal cord,
*  that you have what I'm going to call a pain dial and it operates much like the volume knob on your
*  car stereo. You can turn pain volume up and you can turn pain volume down. And there's many things
*  as we all know that adjust pain volume. So of course, pain medication is one of those things,
*  but it turns out that there's three other things that I want to talk about that also change pain
*  volume. One is stress and anxiety. One is mood and emotions. And the third is attention or what
*  we're focusing on. So specifically what neuroscience says is when stress and anxiety are high and our
*  bodies and our muscles are tense and tight and our thoughts are worried, our brain raises an
*  amplifies pain volume. So pain will feel worse when we're stressed or anxious. Thing two is mood
*  and emotions. What neuroscience says is when our emotions are negative, we're sad, we're miserable,
*  we're depressed. Our brain in particular, our limbic system, amplifies pain volume. So pain will
*  feel worse when emotions are negative. And by the way, that includes anger and rage will amplify
*  pain volume. And thing three is attention or what we're focusing on. And what we know, of course,
*  is that attention changes the pain we feel too. So if you're home in bed thinking about your pain,
*  focusing on your pain, missing out on work and life and hobbies, your brain and specifically your
*  prefrontal cortex will amplify pain volume. So pain feels worse when you're thinking about it and
*  when you're focusing on it. The great news for people living with pain and for people who treat
*  pain is that the opposite is also true. The opposite is also true. When stress and anxiety
*  are low, your muscles are relaxed, your thoughts are calm, your brain sends a message to the pain
*  dial, lowering pain volume. There's a reason why a bazillion studies show, even though people think
*  it's floof and pseudoscience, that relaxation strategies and diaphragmatic breathing and
*  mindfulness-based stress reduction, which have a fund of literature supporting them, lower pain
*  volume. Thing two, we said is mood and emotions. So when our mood is high, we're feeling joyful and
*  happy. We're having pleasurable experiences. Our brain sends a message to the limbic system, our
*  brain's emotion center, as well as other parts of the central nervous system, and that lowers pain
*  volume. So pain feels less bad when emotions are positive. We're engaged in our lives. We're feeling
*  good. We're feeling happy. And thing three is attention. It turns out cognitive factors,
*  what we're paying attention to, what we're thinking about, what we're focusing on, even our belief
*  systems, change pain all the time too. So when we are distracted, we're focused on other things.
*  I like to ask my patients, will you tell me about a time you were so absorbed in some activity,
*  you briefly forgot about your pain? And almost everyone can give me an example of that. And that
*  is not magic. That is your brain's pain dial. So when you are distracted, you're out with friends,
*  you're doing things, you're engaged in your hobbies, your brain sends a message to your pain dial,
*  lowering pain volume. So pain feels less bad in summary. When you are relaxed and calm,
*  when you're cultivating positive emotions, and when you are distracted and not thinking about
*  your pain and engaged in your life. But we know that negative emotions and stress and anxiety,
*  in particular, will amplify the brain's danger alarm. Let's talk about why that's so logical.
*  In an emergency situation, you have to pay more attention. In an emergency situation, you are more
*  likely to be harmed. You do want to be paying more attention to your body, and it's highly adaptive
*  for stress and anxiety to drive your attention inward and to amplify this sense of danger.
*  And as long as you're in a state of stress and anxiety, all throughout your body, you're going
*  to be more sensitive, you're going to be on more alert, you're going to be in this mode of,
*  is everything okay? So we know from research that the experience that you just had makes perfect
*  sense when you think about the emotional aspect of pain. Let's talk a bit about some of those other
*  pathways. So we talked about sensitization to pain. What does desensitization look like?
*  So if you think about the brain getting more sensitive over time, the opposite can also happen.
*  And desensitization is also known as habituation. And there's all this literature in neuroscience
*  that shows that just as a brain can become more sensitive to these danger messages,
*  there are also ways to habituate and desensitize a sensitive brain. So I like to use this metaphor
*  of like if you've ever been in a movie theater and over time, you know, while you've been sitting
*  there in the dark, your eyes have gotten used to the dark and they've acclimated. And at the end
*  of the movie, if someone throws on all the lights and opens up all the blinds, you're like, oh my
*  God, my eyes. And it's very painful. The way you desensitize a brain that's become sensitive to
*  light is that instead of throwing open all the blinds and flooding the room with light,
*  you open the blinds just a teeny bit at a time. So if you're in that movie theater
*  and you crack open the blinds just a little bit and a little bit of light gets in, it might be
*  uncomfortable. But what's actually happening is that after five minutes, it won't be uncomfortable
*  anymore. And then you open the blinds a little bit more and your brain desensitizes a little bit more.
*  And gradually, you're in a light-filled room and you are okay. And it turns out that the treatment
*  for chronic pain, this is just what research says, do not shoot the messenger, is that gradually
*  over time, we can desensitize a sensitive brain by gradually increasing little bits of physical
*  activity and social exposure and movement and again, targeting this whole biopsychosocial pain
*  recipe. And what I want to be clear to say is, again, this is not just my opinion. I treat chronic
*  pain. I've had this chronic pain practice for a very long time. And I watch these miracles occur
*  in my office all the time and I use that word with a lot of like air quotes because it's not
*  a miracle. It's just what science says. And when I get these patients who have been in bed for four
*  years, they have no life and they have no hope. And you can gradually, gradually increase their
*  activity and social exposure and target all the pieces of their pain recipe. They get out of bed
*  and back to life. And my clinical experience and my personal experience, I think it's useful to have
*  lived experience. And also everything I know about 25 years of neuroscience research is that
*  this process works for changing chronic pain. Well, tell me broadly, what is a pain recipe
*  when you use that term? Yeah. So just as there's a recipe for brownies, there's always also a recipe
*  for pain. So we know, of course, like I am not a good cook or a good baker for that matter,
*  but I do love brownies. And we all know that if you want brownies to turn out fudgy and delicious,
*  you have to add certain ingredients in a certain order in an environment that cultivates their
*  perfection. Otherwise you will get truly terrible brownies. Right. And it turns out that the same is
*  true for pain. Just as there's a high pain recipe, there is also a low pain recipe. So if I mapped out
*  my pain recipe, for example, it's poor sleep and sitting for too many hours without moving and eating
*  a crap diet, you know, without making sure that I'm getting appropriate fruits and vegetables and,
*  you know, not exercising and, you know, fights with my partner or my family or whatever. And that will
*  contribute to a really high pain day, you know, and that's not true for everybody. Everybody is unique
*  and everyone has a different pain recipe. But what I love about this recipe concept is that if you
*  look at what goes into your high pain recipe, you can easily map out what goes into a low pain recipe.
*  So for me, poor sleep is a contributor. So I know that I need to go and do a sleep hygiene protocol,
*  for example. There's a lot of protocols for sleep and medication is not the solution. But I know that
*  if I'm not taking care of my sleep, I'm not taking care of my pain. I know that I need to take care
*  of my emotional health. I know that I need to take care of exercise. I know I need to block off time
*  to go outside and walk in the sun, even if it's for 20 minutes a day. So my low pain recipe, I
*  protect very carefully now that I know what it is. But I never would have known if I didn't know
*  what this high recipe thing was. One thing you say in the book is that with chronic pain, you often
*  have to work backwards compared to how you would work with sudden acute pain you would get from a
*  like a traumatic injury. Tell me what you mean by working backwards. So with an acute injury, like
*  breaking a leg, your body gives you this danger message. And of course, you listen to it. And what
*  you need to do to heal from an acute pain episode, like the pain of childbirth or breaking a leg,
*  is you have to rest and heal. Your tissues have to heal before you can do the things.
*  And with chronic pain, it turns out that it's a little bit of the opposite. And I call this
*  process working backwards. And working backwards means you reasonably think that you need to stop
*  doing all the things. And when you've stopped doing all the things, then the pain will go down
*  and then you can resume your life. But with chronic pain, research shows what you have to do
*  is actually the opposite. So it's called pacing for pain is one of the terms that we use. And
*  you're going to gradually increase activity and you're going to gradually increase exposure.
*  And we're not throwing people into the fire here. It's sort of like, I think of pacing like if you
*  told me that you wanted to run a marathon, and maybe you do, I do not. Twenty-six miles of running.
*  Nope.
*  Sounds very painful.
*  Not a goal.
*  But if you want to pace for a marathon, you're going to do a little bit at a time. You're going
*  to go gradually so that your brain and body adjust to the sudden increase in activity. And pacing for
*  pain is much the same. You don't go outside and run a marathon the next day. You pick an activity,
*  whatever it is. And I usually like to pick the most beloved hobby or activity that someone is
*  missing out on, whether it's fudge making or playing soccer. And you map out what it would
*  take to get back to that activity. And if you can only start with standing in your kitchen for three
*  minutes, that's where you start. But pacing for pain takes the beloved activity that you like
*  and divides it up into small, manageable pieces. And gradually you get back to the thing. So I
*  cannot tell you how many patients I've had where they had this impossible goal, like getting back
*  to soccer and they ultimately play soccer again. And the worst part for me of this whole thing is
*  that people with chronic pain come to my office and say, the internet says, that's my favorite,
*  or my doctor says chronic pain is untreatable. And it makes me so infuriated because that is a
*  complete and utter lie. Healthcare providers who say that simply have not been trained in pain in
*  my humble and strong opinion. Chronic pain is treatable. If the brain can change, pain can change
*  and pain is always changing. Anyone who's had pain will tell you that pain is always changing. And if
*  pain can change, pain can change. You wrote something about that, that I find kind of moving.
*  You wrote quote, while avoiding and withdrawing from movement and activities seem reasonable and
*  understandable, resting for too long actually makes it harder to return to the activities you love.
*  And this caught my eye because we're always told to rest more. And oftentimes it seems to me the
*  rest, or at least solely rest, isn't what's needed. In this case, we stiffen. In other cases, we
*  ruminate, you just sit in a room and think about your work or think about what you're nervous about.
*  And so it got me thinking about what the word is for what's needed here, like refreshing or resetting.
*  What is the word you'd use? I mean, I think when it comes to acute pain, rest is exactly what you
*  need. And when it comes to chronic pain, I guess it's respite is the term I would use.
*  Respite is nice.
*  Yeah, where of course, and I want to be clear what I'm saying, like this is not a one size fits all.
*  Like I treat a lot of chronic fatigue syndrome and, you know, resting is an important part of
*  recovery. And also getting back to life is an important part of recovery, depending on
*  people's motivations. But we do need respite when we have chronic pain. So part of the pacing program,
*  when I put someone on a pacing program, is making sure to build in rest and respite as
*  you're pacing and getting your life back. And as people who push ourselves very hard,
*  it's very, very critically important to build in periods of rest and respite and to make sure
*  that you're taking care of your body. And I think especially for people who are,
*  you know, again, forgive the term nerds, and we use our brains a lot too. Sometimes it's important
*  for brains to rest also when it comes to recovering from pain.
*  It can be maddening to be told endlessly in life that just everything is about your stress level.
*  And then you look over at the person next to you who's also stressed out, and they're not
*  crippled over and back pain, or they're not having this autoimmune disease or whatever it might be
*  that you've just been told is being worsened so badly by your stress. And you think about past
*  human beings who, like, until 80 years ago, just you caught a cold and you died. And child
*  mortality was super high and still in many parts of the world is. And they didn't all seem to have
*  back pain. And how do you think about this? There's this weird, like, we're privileged and
*  we live in many ways easier lives, and there is a sense of chronic pain rising, and it gets attached
*  to stress. And yet there's something weird about the stress explanation or centrality to me.
*  Given the comforts we have and the sort of idiosyncratic nature of who these things strike.
*  I do not think in any way that chronic pain is a stress disease. And I want to be very clear.
*  We know that stress is an amplifier, but it's one of 642 amplifiers. It's not the only one.
*  Chronic pain is not a stress disease. And that is not what I'm saying. So if I'm giving that
*  impression, I want to make sure to undo that damage because not true. Pain is not purely
*  emotional. Pain is never purely physical. It's always both. Pain lives at the intersection of
*  neuroscience and biology and mental health and social health and environmental health always.
*  It is never, ever, ever purely emotional or purely to do with stress. I do think that we live in a
*  culture that is incredibly stressful. Like, chronic pain during the pandemic was a crisis.
*  Chronic pain exploded during the pandemic. And people who had chronic pain were suffering more.
*  And people who didn't have chronic pain started developing chronic pain. And it turns out that
*  opioid-related overdoses during the pandemic exploded as well, which is not a coincidence.
*  They went up by something like 30%. So there's a big recipe. But part of the reason the pandemic
*  was a perfect pain recipe is because we were all isolated at home. Mood crashed. People were
*  depressed. Suicidality went through the roof. Like, ask any doctor who works in an inpatient
*  unit, any psychiatrist, like, does demand for medications and inpatient hospitalizations.
*  In some parts of the country, calls to suicide hotlines went up 8,000% during the pandemic.
*  It was, people were really suffering. And stress and anxiety also went through the roof. Obviously,
*  we didn't want to die. We didn't want our loved ones to die. And we were being told that our
*  groceries were potentially contaminated. And watching the news was like this environmental
*  trigger and stressor for everybody. So there was sort of this recipe of things that made the
*  pandemic really challenging for people. So your question about stress is an important one. And
*  I think we have a lot of comforts in life right now. But I don't think that means that life is
*  less stressful. Like, sometimes my patients will come to my office and say, when I explain this
*  concept of a pain recipe or the pain dial, and they'll say, you know, I'm not stressed out at
*  all. So I want to back up and say, there are many stressors on the human body, like moving
*  cross-country is one of them, and divisive politics is another one, and death of a loved
*  one is another one. But living with pain day in and day out is a major stressor on the human body.
*  So it's sort of this thing that we can't escape, we can't avoid. And there's a million things that
*  trigger stress.
*  We've been talking here a lot about the ways in which the brain constructs pain, the ways in which
*  pain can be affected by prediction or by mood or by sleep. How do you think about how you know
*  when it actually is harm? How you, because it's very alluring if you're often in pain to come up
*  with this theory that, oh, my brain has just become too sensitive. I've just over learned it. I just
*  need to meditate more. But maybe there really is something there. You have this great metaphor in
*  the book about sometimes a car alarm goes off and nobody's trying to break into the car. But of
*  course, sometimes somebody is trying to break into the car. How do you distinguish?
*  So what we know about chronic pain, like this is not a theory of mine. What we know about chronic
*  pain is that the brain does become more sensitive over time, and it does misinterpret these danger
*  messages as amplified when they don't need to be. So if someone's experiencing chronic pain
*  and they haven't had the tests and the pokes and the scans, I will send them out to have them,
*  obviously. Because again, I do not want to miss that there's a broken bone or some chronic
*  illness. There's some biological, biomechanical contributor to the pain recipe that I am not
*  paying attention to. Again, I am not saying that medications don't treat pain. I am not saying that
*  biomechanical and biological processes aren't involved here. Of course they are. So what we
*  know is there's this difference between acute pain and that process and chronic pain and that
*  process. So I think what you're asking about, if someone comes to me and they've had chronic
*  pain for 10 years and we've not investigated all the biomechanical drivers or the bio part of their
*  pain recipe, then I haven't done my job. When somebody has chronic pain and they walk in to get
*  care after, I mean, the initial doctor looks at them and nothing is broken, how should the medical
*  system be structured for them? What kinds of care teams or resources or sort of new specialties?
*  I have never in my years of reporting on healthcare policy, I've never found a doctor who
*  thinks the medical system is correctly structured. Fair. And I'm curious in this
*  respect, like we have this huge pain problem for a while we tried to treat it through opioids.
*  We've realized that's a disaster. But how should teams be set up? What should a person have access
*  to they don't now? So when I think about the answer to that problem, I think about, and again,
*  like I am just a nerd and I want to synthesize all the research and what the research says
*  is that the treatment of pain has to be multidisciplinary. This is not my opinion.
*  None of this, by the way, is my opinion. It's just a synthesis of what I'm reading,
*  that treatment has to be multidisciplinary. And what that means is, again, treatment for chronic
*  pain, and I am talking about chronic pain, not a broken leg, needs to involve everybody on the team.
*  We want physicians, we want pain psychologists, we want PTs, we want OTs, we want to consider
*  things like biofeedback and mindfulness based stress reduction, which I rolled my eyes at my
*  entire life until it helped my pain volume go down. But we want the multidisciplinary picture.
*  We want to look at your whole pain recipe and the full biopsychosocial recipe of all the ingredients
*  that are in there that are contributing to your pain, including sleep and diet and movement,
*  and of course biomechanics. Like we want everything in there. And if you think about,
*  again, what's going to make a low pain recipe or what's going to lower pain volume,
*  most of the time, I'm not saying always for everyone, it's not just going to be a pill or
*  a procedure. And we know this. Again, this has been said in the literature for many decades,
*  that pills and procedures alone for pain are not enough. And all the major governmental
*  institutions and medical institutions are calling for a multidisciplinary approach to pain, and we're
*  just not seeing it happening. So what we want is for more, in my mind, what we want is for more
*  healthcare providers across disciplines to be trained in pain, because what's happening now in
*  medical education is that almost nobody is getting trained in pain. Like there's this paper that came
*  out in 2018 that showed that 96% of medical schools in the United States and Canada are lacking pain
*  education, and that the 4% of medical schools that are teaching pain are focusing on the erroneous
*  and outdated biomedical model. Again, where we're just looking at the body part that hurts.
*  We're just looking at the back. We're talking about mechanistic.
*  I want to end by talking a bit about the brain itself and what all this implies for it.
*  And I guess one thing to ask is why there is this difference between hurt and harm, why it is so
*  possible for the nervous system to send such wrong signals, why we think the system didn't evolve
*  to keep a tighter linkage between the two of them. How do you understand the cause of wrong signals
*  or incorrect interpretation? Two things that come to mind for me is we're seeing this anxiety
*  epidemic in America, but around the world also. And the way we talk to patients about anxiety is
*  very similar. The body is getting stuck in emergency danger mode even though there's not
*  actually a lion coming to eat you, which is biologically the purpose that your fight or
*  flight system, your stress and anxiety system exists for. But again, when I think about this
*  with people and including myself, I look around and now I'm hyper attuned to this, now that I
*  understand this pain process and I'm constantly thinking, what are the drivers of anxiety? What
*  are the drivers of stress? What are the drivers of this chronic pain recipe? So there's a lot of
*  things in our environment, I think, that are contributing to what we're seeing with this
*  explosion of anxiety and this explosion of chronic pain, which again is not coincidental, this
*  relationship. And the other thing I think about when you say that is, you mentioned earlier the
*  body keeps the score. And I talk about that book all the time because what happens in that book is
*  it's very clearly shown, the science all illustrates that trauma, like everything else,
*  doesn't just live in the brain, it also lives in the body. It's like the brain is connected to the
*  body 100% of the time, which I think is what we're trying to illustrate here today. And then the body
*  keeps the score. You see how trauma changes your physiology, it changes your nervous system, it
*  changes even your immune functioning and your endocrine functioning, it changes muscle tension.
*  And what we also know is that trauma changes the brain also to amplify pain. It makes your brain
*  more sensitive and like more of a finely tuned instrument. And if you think about why,
*  if you've experienced a trauma, what it means is your brain wasn't quite properly prepared for
*  this terrible thing that happened. So after a trauma, people experience a lot of different
*  symptoms and one of them is called hypervigilance. Hypervigilance is when quite literally you're
*  extra vigilant, you're extra aware, and in your environment around you and outside of you,
*  small bits of sensory information from the environment can trigger an exaggerated response.
*  So if you've lived through a trauma and a trauma can be many different things,
*  and someone taps you on the shoulder and you're experiencing these symptoms of PTSD or post-trauma,
*  you'll be hypervigilant. You'll jump out of your chair from something as not dangerous
*  as someone tapping you on your shoulder. And similarly, the reason that's happening,
*  of course, is because your brain has become extra sensitive as a result of that trauma.
*  And the same thing happens with internal sensory messages also. After a trauma,
*  your brain is not just scanning your external environment for possible danger,
*  it's also scanning your internal environment. Is anything wrong? What about now? Is that dangerous?
*  What about that? So having lived through all the things that we've collectively lived through over
*  the last couple of decades, it's not actually a surprise to me that chronic pain is on the rise
*  when combined with the lack of pain education across disciplines, when combined with the major
*  stressors that we've had, when combined with the fact that we're treating pain incorrectly as a
*  purely biomedical problem rather than a biopsychosocial problem. This gets to this weird
*  metaphysics of the self sometimes. When we're even talking in that conversation about you,
*  right? If you say, well, who are you? What are you? I'll be like, well, my mind, my consciousness is
*  up here in this lump of tissue somewhere. But then we're having all this difficulty, me, right,
*  convincing my brain, my mind, it does not listen to me when I tell it, all kinds of things, frankly,
*  in my life. And it gets a little Buddhist, right, who is thinking these thoughts. But there is
*  something interesting to me across a bunch of these disciplines from the trauma response work
*  to chronic pain, to how difficult it is and how uncertain of a task it is or how sort of circuitous
*  of a task it is to convince your brain of something, right? Even though in theory you can think a
*  thought and it happens in the same vicinity of the brain, it's not like the rest of the system listens.
*  How do you think about that? Like, what is the brain's learning system?
*  I think as the brain's danger detector, it's really adaptive to listen and pay extreme attention to a
*  danger message and to say, this means I have to stop doing all the things. This means I, you know,
*  I can't go to work and I have to stop exercising because for acute pain, again, that's life-saving.
*  You don't go for a run when you've broken your leg. I know I keep using the same example, but
*  it's just such an obvious one. And a lot of people have had injuries like that where your body is
*  telling you to stop. You cannot use that body part. So pain is really hardwired. There's a lot of
*  stuff about pain that's like, this is instinctive and it's life-saving. So it is, of course, very
*  hard to tell your brain, yes, this is an instinct you've had for evolutionary eons and it has saved
*  your life, but now ignore all the instincts and don't do all the things that you've instinctively
*  done to save your life. It's your sort of, you know, going against nature in a way. So it turns
*  out, and I don't think this will surprise you, that better understanding pain actually changes
*  pain. And we can explain why now that we know about the biopsychosocial pain recipe. Once you
*  understand pain better, you're going to be hopefully less scared of getting out of bed and going for a
*  walk, even if it's just for 60 seconds or five minutes or whatever. You're going to be less
*  scared of attempting to resume hobbies. Maybe you will seek out appropriate multidisciplinary care
*  and you will go to a trauma therapist to treat untreated trauma because trauma and pain
*  are best friends. There's an 80% comorbidity of trauma and chronic pain. Maybe you will get a PT
*  and an OT. So learning about pain actually changes your pain experience in part because
*  you have this new understanding and appreciation for what the pain experience is. And maybe you're
*  going to go about treating it differently, but you're surely going to understand it differently.
*  I want to go back to something here that we had talked about earlier, which is the ways you take
*  control of the pain dial and your five parts here, stress and anxiety, mood, attention,
*  interpretations and understanding of pain and coping behaviors. And as I read through that part
*  of the workbook, something that seemed very clear was that this was just how to live.
*  That if you had no pain whatsoever, or maybe no pain yet as a person,
*  that it would still be true that trying to understand what is a good day for you and a bad
*  day for you, trying to understand the ways in which you sleep and see friends and stress and
*  all the rest of it. There's something, I mean, beyond just that pain needs to be treated holistically.
*  It was striking to me how much the way to think about pain just seems to be an offshoot of the
*  way to think about or try to approach your life. And pain sometimes forces a sharpening of that,
*  a more systematic approach, but it was more similar. And that struck me in a way profound.
*  I'm curious, all this work you do on pain, how it changes your thinking about just how to live a day.
*  I think that is a profound interpretation of what we're saying here about how pain works and why we
*  have it and how to get back on track. And I think what you're getting at is this totally true idea
*  that we're all really out of balance. We know that a lot of the times as human beings, we've become
*  more isolated. We don't really exist in communities the way we're biologically built to do. And
*  we are sedentary for so many hours and we do have all these insane stressors piling up. And I don't
*  think we're managing them very well. So I think what you're getting at, which is very true, is if
*  you want to manage a pain problem, you sort of have to get your life in order. You have to learn
*  sleep hygiene. And a lot of people are reliant on medications because again, the biomedical model,
*  we have a lot of pills and procedures as solutions for every problem. We have to get our social
*  connections. We have to pay attention to those and not ignore them because social medicine is real.
*  We have to pay attention, of course, to our bodies. Are we going outside? Are we moving our bodies?
*  Do we have enough support in that realm? For example, if you're going to try and build up your
*  muscles, do you have a physical therapist to work with? Do you have an occupational therapist?
*  So you're sort of seeing the matrix, which is yes, everything is interconnected when it comes to
*  human health. And I think to me, that's what's so compelling about this idea of biopsychosocial
*  health. It turns out that the treatment for depression is not just a pill. We know that now
*  also with all this recent research. And the treatment for anxiety is not just a pill. And
*  shocking to no one, the treatment for pain is also not just a pill.
*  And then always a final question. What are three books you would recommend to the audience?
*  One is Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers by Robert Sapolsky. And it explains how emotional health
*  is always implicated in physical health. And it's always implicated in pain. Emotional health and
*  mental health matters when it comes to treating pain. If you're not treating emotional health and
*  mental health, you're missing a significant part of the pain problem. The other book is The Body
*  Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk. It's been a bestseller for a very long time for a reason.
*  Again, it shows us unequivocally that trauma and emotions, again, don't just live in the head. They
*  also come out in the body. Emotions are somatic by definition. Trauma is somatic by definition.
*  That's not a bad word. If we want to help people who are suffering, we want to reconnect trauma
*  and emotions with physical pain. They're all connected. And the third book is going to be
*  Pain the Science of Suffering, which is by Patrick Wall. He's one of the founders
*  of pain science as we know it today. And he was one of the creators of the gate control theory
*  of pain. And a lot of the stuff that I talked about today is from this fund of science that
*  he sort of established with his partner, Ron Melzack, back in 1965. And pain neuroscience
*  has evolved a lot since then. And we know a lot more about human health and all these drivers of
*  pain. But Pain the Science of Suffering, even though some of the science is outdated,
*  really in my mind lays a foundation for how all of this works and why.
