# Can Kamala Harris Win Back Key Swing States?
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y_qVy6K4s0)
*  My understanding is Harris and her team think they have re-expanded the map.
*  Right.
*  They think that Nevada, Arizona, Georgia are for sure back in play.
*  They think that North Carolina might be back in play.
*  Do you think that's true?
*  Do you think the map has gotten bigger?
*  I think that's right.
*  Cause again, look at the voters that Biden was falling off with, right?
*  Nevada people don't remember it.
*  They think of it as kind of libertarian old miners, right?
*  No, Nevada is extremely diverse and it's like working class voters of color.
*  Right.
*  Big fall off constituency for Biden.
*  Georgia, you have tons of young professionals and tons of great colleges
*  and universities, and of course, tons of black voters, right?
*  The same groups that he's declining from a little bit.
*  North Carolina has been interestingly kind of close in the polls.
*  Arizona is the one that doesn't seem to have moved quite as much.
*  There was one poll yesterday with, with Harris ahead there, but that's right.
*  I mean, I think the map has expanded and it's, it's obviously plausible again, now
*  that she would win Georgia, especially with the Brian Kemp stuff, not helping Trump one bit.
