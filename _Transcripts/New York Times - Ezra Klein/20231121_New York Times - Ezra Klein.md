# The Best Primer Iâ€™ve Heard on Israeli-Palestinian Peace Efforts
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8eeZO_x6PI)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  I've gone back and forth on whether to do an episode on why the Israeli-Palestinian
*  peace process has failed and failed and failed.
*  My worry is that immersing in past failure can become just a way to justify present action
*  or worse, justify present refusal to keep trying.
*  Peace processes don't work until they do.
*  Israelis and Palestinians and for that matter Americans are trapped in arguments over their
*  past.
*  Sometimes it's the ability to forget, not the ability to remember that it is necessary
*  to forge a future.
*  But I can see in the conversations I'm having and the emails I'm getting that what did or
*  didn't happen in this or that negotiation, it really lingers in people's minds.
*  So I wanted to at least try and do an episode tracing the shape of the successes and there
*  have been some and failures until now.
*  My guest today is Aaron David Miller.
*  Miller was a negotiator and an advisor on the American side in the many Middle East
*  peace processes the United States attempted to host, to influence, to manage from 1985
*  to 2003.
*  So he worked on this under Ronald Reagan, under George H.W. Bush, under Bill Clinton,
*  under George W. Bush.
*  He's now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and he's the author
*  of the book The Much Too Promised Land, which is I think the best single volume history
*  I've read of the various peace efforts.
*  One thing this conversation helped clarify for me, we talk about deals in terms of compromises
*  and concessions as if there is some perfect formula out there that if only we discovered
*  it, it could end the conflict.
*  But deals are first and foremost about deal makers who can deliver, who have the desire
*  to deliver, who have the political support among their own constituents to deliver.
*  One thing I can tell you having looked at this is there are no end of ideas out there
*  for what an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement could look like.
*  There are standard ideas, there are weird ideas, there are ambitious ideas, there are
*  modest ideas, but what we don't have, what we perhaps have never had on both sides at
*  the same time, are political leaders who want a deal and who can make and sell a deal and
*  who can enforce it once it is inked.
*  I don't think the work of the next generation is necessarily coming up with a new framework
*  for a deal.
*  It is building and supporting the political leaders and political movements that could
*  actually do a deal.
*  As always, my email, azraklanshow.nwtimes.com.
*  David Miller, welcome to the show.
*  Ezra, it's a pleasure to be here.
*  You write that only three American leaders really belong in the Israeli Arab Peace Hall
*  of Fame.
*  Henry Kissinger, Jimmy Carter, and James Baker.
*  And so I want to go through them in turn.
*  What did Henry Kissinger achieve and why did he achieve it?
*  All three of them, and Kissinger, I think, understood this better than anyone else, that
*  breakthroughs in this conflict or diplomacy in general are usually an interaction between
*  opportunity and human agency.
*  Kissinger understood that when, in fact, the region manifested itself in large amounts
*  of pain, it created a sense of urgency, which, if married to gain, could.
*  There's nothing inevitable about this.
*  Nobody ever lost money betting against Arab Israeli peace.
*  Kissinger understood in the wake of the October Yom Kippur War and the trauma that the Israelis
*  suffered, 2,800 dead, thousands of Egyptians and Syrians dead, that there was opportunity
*  here.
*  Kissinger had the deviousness, the sense of strategy that if he embarked on a journey
*  and stuck with it, he might actually lay the basis and the groundwork for what became an
*  Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
*  We in the United States can be proud of the role that our government has played, and particularly
*  the role that has been played by Secretary Kissinger and his colleagues.
*  This, I would say, is the first significant step toward a permanent peace in the Mideast.
*  It was a combination of a sense of opportunity married to what every good negotiator must
*  have, and that is the capacity to act, slam shut the notebooks, threaten to walk out of
*  the room with respect to both sides.
*  Kissinger would be the first of these three who wrestled with the Israelis, actually sided
*  In the spring of 1975, when he felt the Israeli government was balking over the terms of the
*  second disengagement agreement with Egypt, he actually called for a reassessment of U.S.
*  policy, summoning of our ambassadors in the region back to Washington.
*  It was theater, but it seemed to help press the Israelis to accept the terms of disengagement
*  agreement.
*  It was a combination of ample amounts of honey to gain Israel's confidence, with ample amounts
*  of vinegar, pressure at various times, in order to push both the Israelis and the Egyptians
*  closer to an agreement.
*  One thing that struck me about the story you tell by Kissinger was a sense of respect between
*  the Americans and in this case also one of the Arab leaders, which is Sadat of Egypt.
*  Kissinger stops the Israelis from destroying a major part of the Egyptian military when
*  they have it encircled.
*  And there is in this period a, I don't want to call it an equality, but there is a deeper
*  sense of negotiating between equals in the region than there will be later when the negotiations
*  take up with the Palestinians.
*  I'm curious for your reflections on how that might have mattered here.
*  I think it mattered greatly.
*  The fact is when you're dealing with established states, which have institutions, which have
*  structure, the issues become much more tractable than in the case of a situation in which you
*  have a non-state actor, namely the Palestinian National Movement, without much structure,
*  without much discipline, pursuing violence and terror alongside of negotiations.
*  It becomes much harder and the sort of existential issues were absent in the Israeli-Egyptian
*  peace process, which I think turned it in many respects into a real estate deal, which
*  it is certainly not when it comes to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
*  Yes, real estate is a component, but it is much more than that.
*  I think it's a good place to move to Jimmy Carter.
*  So tell me a bit about his commitment to the issue and what he achieves and what his orientation
*  is on it.
*  You know, when I interviewed Carter for this book, he said, I think it was at the age of
*  three that he became interested in the biblical proposition and in Israel.
*  I mean, Carter was a rare, the rare American leader, the only one frankly, who was not
*  pushed into piss making by the urgency or the exigencies of a situation.
*  He chased after it.
*  It was Carter's single mindedness, his focus, and the moral and ethical sort of frame that
*  he attached to resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict that enabled him to create the sort
*  of intensity of effort that was required both at the first Camp David in September
*  of 1978 and then against the advice of his advisors to embark on a spring trip early
*  in 1979 to iron out the last remaining details of an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
*  When we first arrived at Camp David, the first thing upon which we agreed was to ask the
*  people of the world to pray that our negotiations would be successful.
*  Those prayers have been answered far beyond any expectations.
*  That sense of morality, of course, has followed Carter throughout his career and has made
*  him an extremely controversial former American president willing to weigh in quite aggressively
*  on foreign policy generally, but on the Arab-Israeli conflict in particular.
*  There are a lot of detractors of Jimmy Carter, and it brought home to me the sense that if
*  you're going to be a serious peacemaker, and Kissinger and Carter were serious peacemakers,
*  each accomplished something quite different.
*  Kissinger, we disengaged with agreements, Carter, an actual Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
*  Nobody's going to plant a tree in your honor.
*  You are going to end up riling and fighting with Israelis and, by extension, the American-Jewish
*  community.
*  Well, he does get a Nobel Peace Prize.
*  He does.
*  It's something.
*  Yeah, and he deserves it.
*  But to this day, I interviewed Carter for my book on the presidents.
*  To this day, I don't think he fully understands why the American-Jewish community was so unforgiving
*  of him, given his efforts.
*  Well, isn't one answer to this, and this becomes, I think, important as we move through the
*  story, but isn't one answer that Carter, in terms of his relationships, in terms of his
*  identification with the players in the conflict, is very close with Sadat?
*  He does not find Menachem Begin, the Israeli leader, nearly as congenial.
*  They do not have as deep of a relationship.
*  From then on, I think it's fair to say you exclusively have presidents for whom the Israeli
*  side is far more compelling than anyone on the Palestinian side, anyone on the Arab side.
*  But for Jimmy Carter, he's willing to play much more hardball because he does not naturally
*  feel the sense of identification.
*  He does with the land of Israel, with Jerusalem, with the religious conflict here, but with
*  the leadership of Israel itself.
*  He talks about meeting Sadat as the best day of his presidency.
*  He is very angry oftentimes at the Israeli leadership.
*  There is something distinctive about Carter, which also makes the fact that he is the one
*  who makes the biggest step towards Israel's security a little bit ironic.
*  Yeah.
*  In the second qualification, Carter made it clear to me, and I think I read about it
*  in the book, that he believed Begin came the farthest distance.
*  And he understood that for Begin, this was a huge stretch, in many respects, a much more
*  unnatural stretch than it was for Sadat.
*  But you're quite right, Ezra, about the changing nature of Israel's Arab interlocutors, with
*  one exception, and that was the heroic figure of King Hussein, who, like Sadat, understood
*  the huge value of public diplomacy in an effort to reach out and capture the hearts and minds
*  of Israelis.
*  Let me try to pull out two pieces of texture on this moment.
*  One is that for almost the entirety of Camp David, Begin and Sadat are not talking to
*  each other face to face.
*  You have Jimmy Carter shuttling between different rooms they're sitting in, because he thinks
*  if they're brought together, it'll blow up the negotiations, that he's got to move back
*  and forth.
*  I just think that's a very striking detail, that they're not sitting at a table.
*  And also, at the same time, there's no centralized Palestinian voice there.
*  There's no Yasser Arafat sitting in the third room.
*  So it's just this very different era when the conflict is understood as between Arab
*  countries, Egypt and Syria and Jordan, and Israel.
*  And sure, there's a Palestinian problem.
*  There's this people caught in the middle, but they've not yet even been invited into
*  negotiations over their own fate.
*  Yeah, there's no doubt about that.
*  And I think Sadat concluded that the only way he could regain sovereignty over all of
*  Egypt, plus the dismantling of all Jewish settlements in Sinai, would be to do a separate
*  deal.
*  And Carter wrestled with this because I think he understood the importance of engaging the
*  organizational embodiment of Palestinian nationalism.
*  That's what the PLO was in those days.
*  Carter understood this, but wasn't prepared and couldn't bring the PLO into the negotiations.
*  And frankly, had he tried, I suspect that Begin would not have been able to make the
*  concessions and decisions that he was able to make on Sinai.
*  Palestinians became a real issue in the negotiations during the first Bush administration.
*  So let's talk then briefly about the first Bush administration and what they achieve
*  under Bush 41 and James Baker, whose style in the book, listening to your travels with
*  him, you really delight in James Baker.
*  And I also think what he achieved here is a little fuzzier and harder to know from the
*  outside.
*  So what does James Baker get done?
*  And why is he the one who can get it done?
*  You know, Baker and Bush, because the two go together.
*  It's a level of a situation in which the president of the United States empowered the
*  secretary of the United States.
*  I don't think even no matter how close Tony Blinken is to President Biden, the relationship
*  between Bush and Baker, even though Bush is older, was an organic one.
*  You know, Bush helped Baker through the death of his first wife, and the two of them were
*  as close as any American president and secretary of state could have been.
*  I remember I was in Baker's office once and he was on the phone with somebody and the
*  conversation went something like this, you know, if you don't give me what I need, I'm
*  not going.
*  I just can't go.
*  I mean, I need that authority.
*  Now, I don't think that there have been any secretaries of state that can have that kind
*  of conversation with a president.
*  I think that relationship was critically important to Baker's success, but Baker was the best
*  negotiator that I had ever worked for.
*  Baker was not necessarily a strategist.
*  He was a brilliant tactician.
*  He was a great actor, and we saw him act on any number of occasions.
*  I worked for a half a dozen secretaries of state.
*  I traveled with a half a dozen.
*  I liked them all and they all had their strengths.
*  But when we landed, whether it was Damascus, Cairo, Jerusalem, wherever, you got off that
*  plane, you got into a meeting, you saw Baker's interlocutors sitting on the edge of their
*  chairs wondering what he was going to ask them for.
*  Could they measure up?
*  That sort of toughness was in essence derivative of the fact that he knew that the White House
*  had his back.
*  And that was not always the case with secretaries of state and their presidents or the National
*  Security Council.
*  I remember once in Jerusalem with Powell, he had been undercut and the White House pushed
*  back on a statement that he had made.
*  And he came out of the meeting and he looked at me and he took his fist and he stuck it
*  in my stomach.
*  And Powell was great.
*  He deployed these Yiddishisms every now and then.
*  He grew up in the Bronx around Jews and he said, Aaron, they got me in the Kishkes.
*  And I thought to myself, this would never have happened, working for Baker.
*  There was a Vulcan mind meld between the president and the secretary.
*  And that, more than anything else, I think, highlighted and reinforced Baker's tremendous
*  diplomatic skills.
*  In the Arab-Israeli issue, it took a while to get Baker interested in this.
*  He'd say, I'm not touring around.
*  Don't ask me to go out there.
*  We got to have something to do.
*  He did a lot of telephone diplomacy.
*  So it took nine trips to get to Madrid.
*  We come here to Madrid as realists.
*  We don't expect peace to be negotiated in a day or a week or a month or even a year.
*  It will take time.
*  Both the secretary of state, Jim Baker, and I will play an active role in helping the
*  process succeed.
*  He got the Israelis to sit down with the Israeli-Jordanian delegation.
*  He got Palestinian representation at Madrid.
*  PLO, no.
*  West Bankers and Gazans, yes.
*  You saw the beginnings of Israeli-Syrian negotiations during that period.
*  You saw the roots of what would be described as the multilateral negotiations, Israel and
*  a number of regional parties discussing issues like security, water, the environment.
*  When you step back and look at Madrid, the real significance, in every decade of the
*  last half century to the last century, there has been a major Arab-Israeli war, 48, 56,
*  67, 82.
*  The 90s came and went without a major Arab-Israeli confrontation.
*  I'm persuaded that that decade was warless in large part because of the notion that Baker
*  fabricated at Madrid.
*  Baker eliminated the excuse that the Arabs and the Israelis had used for years as to
*  why there couldn't be an agreement because there was nobody at the other end of the table
*  to talk to.
*  Baker would create a figurative table which I think lasted for most of the decade.
*  But what's so interesting to me about that is that even at that table, I mean we're here
*  in the 90s already, it's the first time you have Palestinians at that table that's in
*  the 90s.
*  It's not the Palestinians we will end up thinking of as on the other side of the table.
*  It's not the PLO.
*  Even quite recently, what was happening at the table, the construction of a partner to
*  negotiate with was very unformed.
*  Even the presence of a Palestinian authority, to use that in a colloquial term, not in terms
*  of the official PA, that's new.
*  I mean the 90s are not that long ago and even under Baker and Bush, you don't have the group
*  that you eventually will.
*  I mean you have this great story in the book of talking with Yitzhak Rabin and him sort
*  of walking through why there's nobody to negotiate with on the Palestinian side and clearly beginning
*  to work himself towards the question of if he's going to negotiate with Yasser Arafat
*  and the PLO.
*  But to people who think it's always been, you know, this Israeli-Palestinian negotiation,
*  it's really very recent.
*  It's a fascinating point because it speaks to the structural problems on the Palestinian
*  side.
*  Also, obviously, the psychological difficulties of bringing a more authentic representation
*  of Palestinian nationalism into the negotiations.
*  That story, Ezra, was a story that I told when Rabin had come for his first meeting
*  with Bill Clinton in the spring of 93.
*  We met at the Washington Hilton, I'll never forget it, and despite the non-smoking sign,
*  Rabin is sitting there chain-smoking and having an analytical discussion with us about
*  how to deal with a Palestinian issue.
*  And by his body language, it was absolutely clear to all of us that he had come to the
*  conclusion that the only way to deal with this was not through Jordan or the West Bank
*  or Gaza.
*  He had to engage the organizational embodiment of Palestinian nationalism.
*  Oslo is such an important accord.
*  I mean, there's been all this talk about the 30th anniversary of Oslo and why did it fail,
*  and it still is the framework that gets talked about and polled.
*  What do the Oslo Accords say or do that makes them such an important framework for so many
*  decades?
*  Most of what is known as the Oslo Accords lie bloodied, battered, and broken somewhere.
*  But there are two important elements which have endured.
*  One is the mutual recognition package that brought Israel for the first time into a direct
*  acknowledgement, recognition, and negotiation with the organizational embodiment of Palestinian
*  nationalism, the PLO.
*  That relationship, the capacity of both sides to look one another in the eye and to sit
*  with one another as authentic, genuine expressions of the needs of both sides is critically important.
*  And is the reality that Oslo brought the Palestinian issue from the Palestinian diaspora into the
*  center of Palestinian life in part of historic Palestine, the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem.
*  And in doing so, it forced Palestinians to begin the torturous process of creating self-governance
*  and Palestinian institutions under extremely difficult circumstances, to say the least.
*  But again, it's real and it's authentic.
*  In that sense, Oslo succeeded, I think, in at least defining the nature of the problem.
*  One thing that struck me, there is to me the most indelible image of the entire US-Israeli-Palestinian
*  peace process.
*  It was nothing short of breathtaking.
*  Two veteran warriors of Middle East battlefields joining a young American president in the
*  first step toward peace.
*  And at Arafat's instigation, a handshake between two men who had been bitter enemies for decades.
*  Rabin and Arafat shaking hands on the White House lawn, Bill Clinton is next to them beaming,
*  thrilled.
*  And what is so ironic about that image is that America had almost nothing to do with
*  it.
*  So can you tell me what is happening in that image?
*  By the spring of 93, it was clear that there was an Oslo channel.
*  We were being briefed up to a point, not about Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation, mutual
*  recognition, which became part of the Oslo Accords.
*  But we knew there was a channel and we even had some sense that it could have been a decision-making
*  channel.
*  And I remember I was on vacation with my family in the west coast of Florida.
*  I got a call from State Department Ops Center saying, you better come home quickly.
*  Secretary is going to go out to California where he's going to meet the Israeli foreign
*  minister and Norwegian foreign minister and rush back to Washington.
*  And what unfolded then was quite remarkable.
*  A request by Perez that the United States host what would then become a signing ceremony.
*  And Perez initially said, why don't you assume credit and responsibility?
*  Just for listeners, who is Perez?
*  Shimon Perez was then foreign minister under Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister.
*  Why don't you assume credit for this?
*  And Christopher, to his credit, a decent human, said absolutely not.
*  But they asked the administration if they would host the signing ceremony.
*  That event on a cloudless, hot Washington day, September 13th, 1993, was etched in my
*  mind watching those three.
*  A beaming Clinton, a very pleased Arafat, and a quite uncomfortable Rabin.
*  The prime minister was to some degree shy.
*  I thought that I was in a galaxy far, far away.
*  And I reached the conclusion, galactic misjudgment, that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,
*  negotiations had reached a point of no return.
*  And there was no going back.
*  And caught up in that moment, I couldn't understand fully that unlike Madrid, unlike the disengagement
*  agreements, unlike the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, we were embarking on an enterprise
*  so complicated, so fraught with political risk and existential risk for those who participated
*  in it, that this would end up with twists and turns, cruel, hopeful twists and turns
*  along the way.
*  In reflection now, I think I understand where the analytical problem was.
*  And that's this, that the issues on the table, borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, what
*  the Israelis wanted, recognition of Israel as the nation-state of the Jews, and the end
*  of all conflict and claims, those six issues were unbelievably complicated and would prove
*  to be impervious to Israeli-Palestinian agreement and clearly impervious to American mediation.
*  We were able to be effective brokers of an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
*  We were an effective broker of the process to Madrid.
*  When it came to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, there was at least one complicating factor.
*  That was our greatest asset and our greatest liability, which was the extraordinarily close
*  relationship that we had with the state of Israel.
*  Because of our close identification with Israel, because of the domestic politics, we could
*  not manage to play that role.
*  We tried, and this is a disagreement that I've had with my colleagues.
*  I wrote an op-ed in 2005 in the Washington Post titled Israel's Lawyer.
*  I had resurrected that term out of Kissinger's memoirs for Baker.
*  He loved it.
*  He kept saying, don't make me Israel's lawyer.
*  I ain't going to be Israel's lawyer.
*  I admitted in that op-ed that I know a lawyer when I see one, and far too often during the
*  Clinton administration, myself included.
*  Far too often we acted as Israel's lawyer when in fact our client was not Israel or
*  the Palestinians.
*  It was an agreement.
*  That's who our client was, what our client was.
*  Whether or not that was the determinative factor, Ezra, in not being able to reach an
*  agreement, maybe it was the degree of difficulty of the issues themselves.
*  That is not a position that is uniformly agreed between me and many of my colleagues
*  who participated in this process.
*  But it is my view that because of the nature of our special relationship, it was extremely
*  difficult for any American president or secretary of state to play the kind of role that would
*  have been necessary in order to reach an agreement.
*  What comes next in a lot of people's minds is Camp David.
*  I think the Israeli narrative and probably the dominant American narrative is that a
*  Camp David of an Israeli leader, Ehud Barak, who's willing to offer a serious deal.
*  Bill Clinton is there.
*  He's putting his power, his prestige, his time into negotiating this.
*  And Arafat basically just walks away at the end.
*  More than he walks away, the second the defata begins, which really marks the end of the
*  peace process in important ways.
*  But before we get to that, what was offered at Camp David?
*  How do the narratives of the various sides differ?
*  And do you think any of those offers could have been accepted and sold to the respective
*  constituencies?
*  The Camp David summit was, in my judgment, even though I argued for it at the time, ill-advised,
*  ill-conceived and ill-managed.
*  And as a consequence, we ended up in a situation where a 14-day summit ran us, not the other
*  way around.
*  And let me make it clear.
*  Ehud Barak went farther at Camp David than any Israeli prime minister had ever gone.
*  There's no question about it.
*  Arafat came to Camp David to survive.
*  He warned the president and Madeleine Albright that a summit that was not properly prepared
*  would not succeed.
*  Worried constantly, although assured by Bill Clinton, that he would not be blamed, he came
*  to Camp David determined to defend Palestinian positions, what I call the narrative, with
*  very little sense of either making a counteroffer to the ideas on the table or, number two,
*  to put forward a Palestinian proposal of his own.
*  What Barak was prepared to accept at Camp David was this.
*  Israel would be allowed to annex 9% of the West Bank, and in exchange, Palestine would
*  have sovereignty over roughly 1% of pre-1967 Israel, but with no indication of where that
*  1% would be.
*  On the very highly sensitive issue of refugees, the proposal only spoke of a satisfactory
*  solution to the problem.
*  Even on Jerusalem, where most of the detail was provided, there were a lot of gaps.
*  So no Palestinian leader, I'll repeat it, no Palestinian leader could have accepted
*  that proposal and survived.
*  What Arafat's models were, Sadat, 100% of Sinai, and the dismantling of all Jewish settlements,
*  and Barak is offering Arafat 91%, and a 1% territory which would have been taken out
*  of Israel proper, but not defined where it was or what it would be.
*  Arafat could not have accepted this.
*  The notion, and I've said this a million times to anybody who'll listen, the notion
*  that we were this close, thumb and first finger, a quarter of an inch, a sixteenth of an inch
*  apart, the notion that we were that close at Camp David and that Arafat walked away
*  is simply wrong.
*  We were this close and I extended my arms out as far as I possibly could.
*  That was not Arafat's transgression.
*  It was that he wouldn't counter nor would he offer a proposal that diverged at all from
*  the Palestinian narrative, which was 100% of the West Bank, control over everything
*  in East Jerusalem, and some solution to the refugee problem that would have not just included
*  the return of Palestinians to a Palestinian state, but to Israel proper.
*  I think that in many respects is a much more valid criticism of Arafat's behavior at the
*  summit than basically to say that he walked away from a formal proposal that could have
*  led to a conflict-ending agreement.
*  We've discussed the way Arafat's elevation in international negotiations to leader of
*  the Palestinians, sole voice for the Palestinian people, is very recent at this point.
*  The PLO is an important organization, but until the handshake in 93 on the White House
*  lawn, who you call when you are calling to make a deal with the Palestinians was much
*  less settled.
*  When I read your book and when I read other histories of this, that strikes me as still
*  a big part of the problem, which is to say that Arafat, it sounds like, and you can tell
*  me if you think this is true or false, didn't really have the authority to make the deal.
*  He could not himself, he did not have the power, the control over Palestinian society,
*  the institutions to make a counter offer, sell it and enforce it.
*  But for all that he wants to be the negotiator, he is aware of his own politics and he does
*  not have the authority to make the kinds of offers Barak doesn't, which is to say in a
*  way that the ground wasn't ready for this.
*  When Israelis say they did not have a partner for peace, that they are right.
*  And Barak's view that you could kind of have a big deal settlement was at this point, and
*  maybe still we'll talk about that, wrong.
*  Look, if Arafat couldn't do this deal or any deal with the moral authority that he had
*  and with legitimacy that he had, even presiding over a fractious Palestinian national movement,
*  then I'm not entirely persuaded any Palestinian leader could do this deal.
*  But again, remember, Ezra, we were at the beginning of a process.
*  This was to date the only negotiation where you had an empowered American president willing
*  to do whatever he could do six months before he left office.
*  An Israeli, risk-ready Israeli prime minister who put things on the table that we had never
*  heard before and that surprised most of us, and a Palestinian leader who had authority,
*  stature, and who was viewed by most of the international community as the primary address
*  for negotiations with Palestinians.
*  Negotiations with Palestinians, the critique on Arafat, and after spending hundreds and
*  hundreds of hours with him, I'm not sure we really fully understood who he was.
*  People would say, what do you mean you didn't understand who he was?
*  You should have grasped this from the beginning, that he presided over a
*  pseudo-revolutionary movement. He was the monadl, the struggler, and that he didn't have the
*  capacity to make the transition because he lived in a world, in a political world for decades
*  that was so unlike any of his counterparts.
*  And that we really never understood, or maybe we didn't want to understand, because in essence,
*  he was the address and he had delivered during the early phases of the Oslo process, and even Rabin,
*  who was no fan, to say the least, of Yasser Arafat,
*  respected that Arafat had made some very tough decisions. The last time I saw him officially
*  was in March of 2002, and the Israelis had surrounded his Mukata
*  in his conference room where he had met many times before. Windows blacked out, doors barricaded.
*  The only light in the room was candlelight, and there he was in this darkened candlelit room
*  with his forbidding black machine pistol on the table in full view, talking about martyrdom
*  and how it was critically important that if necessary, he would die in the defense of
*  Palestine. That was my last official image of Yasser Arafat, and I left that meeting wondering
*  whether or not, based on who he was and his life story, did he have the capacity to deliver.
*  Now, on reflection, looking back with the Palestinian national movement
*  looking literally like Noah's Ark, there are two of everything. Two statelets, two constitutions,
*  two sets of security services, two sets of patrons, Hamasistan, at least for the moment,
*  and Abbas presiding over 40% of the West Bank,
*  18th year of a four-year term. I wondered if you can't do the deal with Arafat and you can't do
*  the deal without him, what does that say about Palestinian leadership going forward?
*  To me, even having read accounts on both sides, it always does feel like the tell.
*  The absence of Palestinian counter offer. I think this is very important to Israelis in the way
*  they think of their role in the conflict. Yes, many of them agree the occupation is bad, it's
*  immoral, it's deforming Israeli society, it's terrible for the Palestinians, but they say we
*  have no partner for peace. We tried and we've tried a number of times. There's a later offer from
*  Omer, and there's no partner because nobody ever comes back. As hard as the issues is, even with
*  a maximalist position, nobody ever comes back from the Palestinian side and says,
*  here's my unreasonable thing that you certainly won't agree to, but at least here I'm putting it
*  out in writing. And maybe it's because of Yasser Arafat's background in life history, or maybe it's
*  because they don't have the domestic political power to do the job, but they don't have the
*  background in life history, or maybe it's because they don't have the domestic political capital
*  at home to survive that, because Hamas will then take advantage of the failure, whatever it is.
*  I think that the story you tell here is balanced as the way you try to tell it is.
*  It does affirm to me the Israeli story, which is that there has never been a partner, there's
*  never been a counter offer, there's never been somebody on the Palestinian side willing to say,
*  this is what we would accept, even if it's not what you would accept, and then work from there
*  to where you'd have to go. I mean, what am I getting wrong here?
*  Michael S. Lauer Well, we could elaborate a little, but there's no question that if you took a look
*  at your trajectory of offers, from Camp David to the Clinton parameters, to the Taba negotiations,
*  to the Ehud Omar to Bas negotiations, in which Omar offers 6.5% to be annexed, and then offers
*  the Palestinians 5.9% of territory to offset that, and then you move on to that to the Kerry
*  proposals of 2013-2014, there's no doubt that that trajectory validates, invited a man or woman
*  from Mars down to observe this situation. And the conclusion would be, whatever the asymmetry of
*  power, however just the Palestinian claim that we have to settle for only 22%, when in fact,
*  we wanted all of historic Palestine. So any departure from that 22%, we won't accept.
*  But the reality is, there was no counter offer, either at Camp David, the Clinton parameters,
*  Abbas never responded to Omar, and he left the Kerry proposals 2013-2014 on the table.
*  There's no question that even the most ardent critic of Israel's occupation
*  of the West Bank would have to acknowledge that in effect, when you make the perfect the enemy of
*  the good, you get neither the perfect nor the good. So I guess I would argue that on balance,
*  had there been a counter offer, or had the Palestinians put a proposal on the table
*  and press the Israelis, maybe the outcome would have been different.
*  Let me ask you something, because I'm just some guy with a podcast, reading history books. But
*  you have had for decades, deep contact and relationships with Yasser Arafat, with many
*  on the Palestinian negotiating teams. Surely you've said to them, where's your counter offer,
*  if only for your own PR? Why are you not coming back here with something?
*  And they don't want to be seen and they reject being seen as the ones who collapsed these
*  negotiations. They don't want to be seen by the international community to be unwilling to
*  negotiate. What do they say to you? The Palestinian negotiators that we dealt with,
*  actually were quite intrigued and interested in alternative proposals. There was a lot of
*  internecine conflict between the negotiators and Arafat played on that, playing one against the
*  other. But I think those Palestinians who understood the chairman actually were prepared to be much more
*  flexible. And had it been left to the Israeli and Palestinian negotiating team during those years,
*  the odds of reaching an agreement I think would have been much higher. But they were captives of
*  a system. And there was no way, given the way that system was structured, that you could have seen
*  any serious challenge. No one could have gone to Arafat and said, look boss, you can't continue
*  to behave this way. Not a chance. And I think that was a huge factor in trying to understand and to
*  it why Arafat was simply not, he could not be moved from the 22% solution, which was a near perfect
*  narrative, which would have required the Israelis to make significant compromises on core issues
*  while leaving the Palestinian position more or less intact. There are those who believe that
*  there was Palestinian flexibility at Camp David. They were prepared to agree to swaps, for example.
*  The Israelis wanted 4 or 5% to be annexed in order to deal with the demographic and security realities,
*  including incorporating settlements and settlement blocks in Israel proper. Palestinians were prepared
*  to accept swaps. But I don't see how you could have come closer than what Ehud Omer offered them,
*  which was virtually adding everything up to 100%. It was part Arafat, it was part the structure of
*  the negotiations, it was part the mistrust and absence of confidence. It was part the failure
*  of the interim process, which turned everything into a negotiation. Palestinians were put on
*  probation. But in the end, what is leadership? You often hear this question, is the problem here in
*  1967 or is it 1948? Is a problem for the negotiations for Palestinians, at least within
*  negotiation, are they willing to take a deal that is about the territory Israel gained, West Bank and
*  Gaza in 67? Or is a problem the founding of the state of Israel? And as such, there is no resolution.
*  Well, clearly in the case of Amas, which is the organizational embodiment of an idea,
*  which is the elimination of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state,
*  that is clearly the case. Do I believe that it is conceivable possible that a Palestinian
*  leader could emerge that would agree to a deal based on the Clinton parameters
*  and any other adjustments that would meet both Israeli and Palestinian needs and requirements?
*  Do I believe that this process could only occur through a negotiation? And that, in essence,
*  what the last month has demonstrated with a terrifying ferocity, it has shattered,
*  in my judgment, any illusion that anyone has ever had that Israelis and Palestinians could somehow
*  coexist peacefully in either a one state reality, which is what we have now, or some sort of
*  bi-national state where Israelis and Palestinians live happily ever after under one roof?
*  No. The only solution to this conflict is separation through negotiation. There must be a
*  way to address the proximity problem, which is what separates this negotiation
*  from Israel's relationships with Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, the Abraham Accords for sure.
*  Separation through negotiation. I think it was Twain who said that proximity breeds contempt
*  and children, but for sure it's going to continue to breed terror and violence.
*  Let me take the Israeli perspective on this for a moment. And there's a lot in the last 10 or 15
*  years of Israeli politics I am profoundly critical of and disgusted by. But I think if you're an
*  Israeli hearing this, there is nobody to have that negotiation with. You're not going to have
*  it with Hamas. As you say, they're an embodiment of the idea that Israel must be destroyed.
*  Abbas has functionally no support. He's unbelievably unpopular from everything we
*  can tell. Even if you could make a deal with Abbas, there's no reason to think Hamas would abide by it.
*  There are other players like Ghazal Jihad and other even more extreme players circling.
*  So when you talk about negotiations, I mean, if you couldn't have a negotiation in the end
*  with Arafat for whatever reason, the situation seems dramatically worse now. And so the idea
*  that there is any pathway here that is negotiation seems almost like a category error. That nobody
*  has the control over the situation on the Palestinian side, the support. Nobody speaks
*  with enough authority that there is a deal to be made. And so I think you talk often in the book
*  about the way Israelis often see Americans as naive about Palestinians, about Arabs.
*  That we're over here and we like to put things in our frameworks of negotiations and diplomacy
*  and liberal democracy. And got a great scene where Rabin just waves his hand and says,
*  you don't understand the Arabs. You talk about a flight with Netanyahu where he says,
*  you can afford to give the Arabs the benefit of the doubt from the safety and security of Washington.
*  Out here in our neighborhood, we can't and won't. And for them, like even if you had more moderate,
*  more open minded leadership than Netanyahu, there's nobody on the other side of the table.
*  That's fake. It's a Washington construction. I don't think anybody in your right mind
*  could argue with that assessment. I mean, we began this conversation with trying to answer
*  the question as to why we haven't had an Israeli-Palestinian conflict ending agreement.
*  In my judgment, the sun, the moon and the stars were never aligned. And they are certainly not
*  aligned now because what you need, you do not have. But I don't and will not surrender to
*  the forces of hopelessness and despair to basically argue that it simply cannot be.
*  You need at least four things. Number one, you need leaders on both sides who are masters of
*  their politics, not prisoners of their ideologies. You do not have that. Number two, you need a sense
*  of real ownership. The profound piece of philosophy that in the history of the world, nobody ever
*  washes a rental car is critically important because people care about what they own
*  and there's no ownership. Every breakthrough, everyone without exception was preceded
*  by or conducted without the presence of the United States. And you do not have that sense
*  that Israelis and the Palestinians have to do this because it makes sense for them.
*  Number three, you need effective mediation. If not from the US, then by another party that is prepared
*  to apply ample amounts of honey and assurance and a lot of vinegar and pressure when necessary.
*  And finally, you're going to need an organizing framework in which both sides can see the outlines
*  of where this is headed, an end state. We don't have any of those things.
*  One thing I think a Palestinian might say here is it might be the case that Israel has not had a
*  partner able to deliver on a peace deal, but it's also the case that Israel has not been strengthening
*  the position of the kinds of partners who might be able to deliver on a peace deal.
*  They didn't spend the last 10 or 15 years making Abbas look better, making his relative moderation
*  deliver for Palestinians. Instead, they've actively undermined him. They made him a security
*  subcontractor, but at the same time, they let settlers run wild, building settlements and
*  functionally annexing parts of the West Bank. There's been a lot of violence there.
*  Whatever was true 15 years ago, doesn't at this point Israel also bear some responsibility
*  for acting in a way that you could argue strengthened Hamas? Netanyahu has talked
*  about trying to keep the two sides divided and certainly not acting in a way
*  that made it look to Palestinians like their more moderate leadership could actually deliver for them.
*  I think that's 100% correct. I think the Israeli strategy, certainly the strategy of Mr. Netanyahu,
*  was what I call the three-state solution. He was perfectly comfortable with Abbas in control of 40%
*  of the West Bank while the Israelis control 60% in area C in which the Palestinians have no
*  political, civilian or military security control, and Hamas is standing Gaza and the state of Israel.
*  As long as the Palestinians cannot claim monopoly on the forces of violence within their society,
*  and they cannot, which is the ultimate element of credibility and legitimacy of a state,
*  then there was no way without one gun, one authority, one negotiating position that the
*  Palestinian national movement could ever present itself as a credible, legitimate interlocutor.
*  As a consequence, that was just fine with an Israeli government that was far more interested
*  in what I call the 22-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, 22 members of the Arab League,
*  than it was in the two-state solution. So yes, and everything that the government has done
*  with respect to delegitimizing the Palestinian authority, creating a situation through expanded
*  settlement activity, land confiscation, certainly in the last 10 months, where the government
*  guidelines basically articulated an unbreakable link between Israel and the term they use,
*  Judea and Samaria. So there's no question about it.
*  Peter T. Leeson Let's say we are somewhere in the future,
*  not super far in the future, but Netanyahu has fallen because he is widely loathe the
*  dinosaur right now. Benny Gantz is now prime minister. Let's say Joe Biden is still president,
*  and Gantz and Biden are sitting down, and they're thinking about number one on your list there,
*  that you actually need leaders on both sides who are masters of their craft. And I'm not saying
*  Biden and Gantz are necessarily those leaders on the American or Israeli sides, but that one precursor
*  to anything ever being possible is a stronger Palestinian leadership, a leadership that has
*  proven through success or something else that it is worthwhile for the Palestinian people and so
*  has developed support in a way that the current Palestinian authority or Hamas has not. What do
*  you do? Is that in their power at all? I mean, in some ways, it's a ridiculous question. The
*  Palestinians don't want Israel's help in creating a leadership, but if you're going to try to create
*  conditions for something like that to emerge, if that was your goal for the next 10 years,
*  just in 10 years to have somebody to negotiate with, what do you do? What would you advise them
*  to do? Are leaders born or do they emerge in response to crisis and or opportunity?
*  Where did Vladimir Zelensky come from? How do you produce a de cleric and a Mandela? Nobody
*  believed apartheid would end the way it did. Nobody. And yet it ended largely because of
*  Mandela and de cleric. That kind of leadership existed certainly in the Arab-Israeli context,
*  with a Bagan and a Sadat and even Arafat in his initial incarnation, but they're all gone now.
*  And legitimizing Palestinian leadership certainly requires elections. But even then,
*  can you have elections that make any sense and produce leaders
*  when you have this perverse dance between the occupier and the occupied?
*  I mean, elections are how you got Hamas.
*  Yes, that's right. And you haven't had legislative elections or presidential elections,
*  certainly not presidential elections since 2005. But you're going to need new leadership. And where
*  does that come from? Marwan Bargoudi, who is serving five lifetime sentences in an Israeli jail,
*  October 6, the Arab barometer in conjunction with Khalil Shikaki's polling organization,
*  took a poll, this was a day before October 7, and asked 790 respondents who they would vote for
*  for president. 12% said Abbas, 24% said Ismail Haniyeh, political leader of Hamas,
*  33-4% said Marwan Bargoudi. I can't answer that question, Israel. And in not answering it,
*  or not being able to answer it, and not being able to see the emergence of a Palestinian leader
*  who has both the street cred, the legitimacy, and the authority, I don't see it happening.
*  Should Israel release Bargoudi?
*  I mean, it's been considered numerous times by the Israelis. And I don't know in view of what's
*  happened over the last four months, whether any act that Palestinians or Israelis can take in the
*  short term, that that would create a different sort of environment. I mean, you're going to be
*  dealing with two traumatized communities, and there will be a political reckoning on each side.
*  Israel has an institutional set of arrangements that will allow that political reckoning
*  to have some sense of structure. People will resign. There may be another election or a new
*  government constituted in place. But the course correction is not going to be toward a center
*  left government. More likely, it's going to be toward a center right government. And on the
*  Palestinian side, what does the future hold for them? If Hamas survives, even if residual elements
*  survive to create an insurgency in Gaza, over time, Palestinian national movement will remain,
*  as I mentioned it before, like Noah's Ark. Abbas is 88. At some point, he'll pass from the scene.
*  Maybe there'll be a collegial leadership that'll emerge, several individuals.
*  It is my contention, and this is why I tend to, at least on this piece, I tend toward hopelessness
*  and despair on this issue, is because of the absence of leadership. I don't see how
*  Israelis and Palestinians even manage this process without leaders of such stature
*  who are admired with authority to make the kinds of decisions required. If I was depressed before
*  this conversation began, I'm thoroughly depressed now, because the clarity of what's coming seems
*  to me to be so inescapable.
*  I want to go back to something about the leadership, which is my colleague Tom Friedman,
*  who has forgotten more about Israel and Palestine than I will ever know, recently put out a column
*  where he said, it's time for a Biden plan that at least put something down on paper, make it public,
*  put something down on paper, make it public, and force different players on different sides
*  to show where they are. Abbas, Netanyahu, Gantz, whoever you want to think about as a possible
*  decision maker here, do you think that would be productive? I love Tom, and we talk and argue
*  about this stuff all the time. Look, a Biden plan might improve American credibility.
*  It would certainly put the US on record as proposing at least where we stood.
*  But a plan without a pathway to actualize it becomes just another sort of rhetorical,
*  it's a substitute for a peace conference, which we actually don't need, and failure costs.
*  So do I think for American interests, it would be important to put something out,
*  both as a recognition that the United States still believes in a diplomatic process and an end state
*  that could, if Israelis and Palestinians were prepared to rise to the challenge,
*  moderate or perhaps one day end the conflict? Yeah, I think that's fine. But it comes along
*  with a huge responsibility, and that is to actually do things to bring Israelis and Palestinians
*  closer to a point where in fact, they could accept such a plan.
*  Well, let me end on that question, because we have just knocked down or mired in complexity,
*  lots of things different people can maybe do. Who could do what, in your view? What would be
*  moves, be they by Abbas, by other players in the Palestinian set of regimes, by Israelis, by Gantz,
*  by Netanyahu, by Biden, by Blinken, by Saudi Arabia, by Europeans? Who can do what? What is
*  an actual lever, somebody with power in this could pull that would be productive? You're talking
*  about something that could actually be done in the moment, now? Yes, or in the coming months. I'm not
*  talking about a plan. I'm not somebody, I keep saying this on the show, I do not believe in
*  solutions here right now. I think we are in a way pre-solutionary space. I think talk of two state
*  deals is ridiculous. But there is better and there is worse. There are actions, there's increments.
*  You can always do something. What should somebody do? Well, for openers, I would argue that the
*  current Israeli government for their own interests ought to do everything they possibly can to ensure
*  that you don't have settlers engaging in vigilantism and forcing Palestinians off of their land,
*  harassing and even killing them. And the Biden administration has pressed the Israelis, but it
*  still continues. I mean, I think the numbers are at least over a thousand, maybe more Palestinians
*  have literally been forced off of their land. And while we have this conversation,
*  elements of the Israeli government, particularly Bezalel Smotrich, are busy at work trying to
*  continue to pursue literally under the cover of this distraction in Gaza, a policy toward the
*  West Bank, which is annexationist in everything but name. That process continues.
*  But I can't give you an RX or a prescription. Mahmoud Abbas is capable of doing almost nothing
*  right now, in large part because he's perceived to have done nothing in order to alleviate
*  Palestinian suffering in Gaza and can't even protect his own constituents in the West Bank.
*  So I mean, I wish I could answer that question. I can't.
*  I appreciate that honesty. We're not a show that tries to peddle on false hope.
*  I think that's a place to end. So always our final question.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  The Peace Puzzle by Daniel Kurtzer et al. Arabs and Israelis, Conflict in the Middle East
*  by Feldman Shikaki, Said, and The Missing Peace by Dennis Ross.
