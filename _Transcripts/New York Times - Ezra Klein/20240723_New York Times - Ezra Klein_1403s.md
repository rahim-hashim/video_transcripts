# Are Democrats Right to Unite Around Kamala Harris?
**New York Times - Ezra Klein:** [July 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=0.0s)]
*  Last week, the Republican Party held its convention in Milwaukee. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  My colleague Elias Isquith described it as a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=27.84s)]
*  mega church service held in a Vegas casino under the ever watchful gaze of a living god. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=30.72s)]
*  And that felt about right to me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=37.64s)]
*  All that week I heard, America first, America first, America first. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=39.78s)]
*  It was crystal clear who came first. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=45.32s)]
*  Donald J. Trump. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  This was a party that had persuaded itself that one man's ambition, his insatiable, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=49.96s)]
*  unquenchable lust for power was actually self-sacrifice. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=56.16s)]
*  That Trump cared not a whit for himself. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  He was only in this for you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=63.0s)]
*  My father didn't have to run for reelection this year. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=64.8s)]
*  He doesn't need the money, the fame, the power. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=68.12s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't need to run for president for fame or money. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=70.52s)]
*  We all know he doesn't need this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=74.24s)]
*  This guy's got a great life. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=76.0s)]
*  He's a billionaire who could play golf every day at his own golf courses. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=77.44s)]
*  And yet, instead of choosing the easy path, he chose to endure abuse, slander and persecution. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=82.52s)]
*  He's not doing it for himself. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  He's doing it for everyone here tonight, for everyone watching at home. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=93.56s)]
*  Because he loves this country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=99.52s)]
*  Because he loves this country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  He's willing to risk it all because he loves this country. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  Across that convention, Trump was spoken of in religious terms. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=110.52s)]
*  He was a man persecuted on behalf of all who put their faith in him. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  A leader on a divine mission, chosen and protected by an almighty God. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=118.56s)]
*  If you did not believe in him, you did not believe in America. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=123.64s)]
*  On the final night, shortly before Trump spoke, Hulk Hogan took the stage wearing a shirt [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=128.24s)]
*  emblazoned with the American flag. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  He sent the crowd into a frenzy as he ripped that shirt, ripping the flag on it in half, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=135.72s)]
*  to reveal a Donald Trump campaign shirt beneath. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=142.56s)]
*  It was all so unbearably literal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=145.78s)]
*  When they took a shot at my hero, and they tried to kill the next president of the United [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=149.28s)]
*  States. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=160.72s)]
*  Enough was enough. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=161.72s)]
*  And I said, let Trumpamania run wild, brother. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=162.72s)]
*  Let Trumpamania rule again. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=163.72s)]
*  Let Trumpamania make America great again. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=164.72s)]
*  In 2020 and early 2021, Donald Trump tried to overturn an election he lost. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=165.72s)]
*  He used the full power of the presidency to pressure state election officials. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=185.16s)]
*  He whipped up a mob that stormed the Capitol and endangered the lives of the men and women [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=190.29999999999998s)]
*  he served with, including his own vice president, Mike Pence. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=195.56s)]
*  People died on that day. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=200.06s)]
*  And how did the Republican Party react? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=202.06s)]
*  Ultimately, by submitting to Trump's fantasies and resentments. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=204.6s)]
*  Where was Mike Pence, the vice president from Donald Trump's first term, the longtime loyal [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=209.0s)]
*  Republican? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=214.0s)]
*  He wasn't at the convention. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=215.48s)]
*  He was in exile, replaced by JD Vance. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=217.16s)]
*  Pence certified the 2020 election. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=220.12s)]
*  At a crucial moment, he put America first. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=222.4s)]
*  Vance has said he would have backed Trump's challenge, indulged his lies. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=225.04s)]
*  There was no price Donald Trump would not have paid to cling to power. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=229.98s)]
*  And the message of the 2024 Republican convention was that there was no price, there is no price, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=233.72s)]
*  the Republican Party would not pay to give Trump that power again. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=240.06s)]
*  The message is simple. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=244.14000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump first. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=245.82s)]
*  With faith and devotion, I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=248.7s)]
*  States. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=255.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=256.3s)]
*  What President Joe Biden did on Sunday, that is what it looks like to put country first. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=257.3s)]
*  What the Democratic Party did over the past few weeks, that is what it looks like to put [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=262.7s)]
*  country first. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  The catastrophe of the debate for Biden was that he couldn't draw the true contrast between [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=268.94s)]
*  him and Trump. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=274.54s)]
*  Instead of highlighting Trump's narcissism and liberalism, Biden was highlighting Trump's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=276.26s)]
*  relative energy and vigor. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=280.94s)]
*  On Sunday, though, Biden upended all that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=283.74s)]
*  In one decision, he drew a very different contrast between him and Trump. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=286.54s)]
*  Trump would not peaceably step aside even after losing an election. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=291.84s)]
*  Biden stepped aside before the 2024 election. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=296.98s)]
*  He willingly gave up his own nomination because he understood that the party and the country [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  are bigger than he is. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=305.86s)]
*  He put his own ambition second. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=307.54s)]
*  That's what it looks like to actually put America first. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=310.5s)]
*  After the debate, I asked whether the Democratic Party was still a true political party, an [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=314.74s)]
*  organization dedicated to values and ideas that transcended any one leader, or whether [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=319.7s)]
*  it had, like the Republican Party before it, been corrupted into a vehicle for one man's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=324.94s)]
*  ambitions and resentments. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=329.97999999999996s)]
*  Now we have our answer. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=332.26s)]
*  The Republican Party is a personality cult run by the dear leader's daughter-in-law. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=333.73999999999995s)]
*  The Democratic Party is a political party. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=338.46s)]
*  It is a political party that wants to win. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=340.85999999999996s)]
*  But now the Democratic Party has a decision to make, an open convention or coronation [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=343.78s)]
*  of Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=349.06s)]
*  As you know, if you've been listening to the show over the last year, I've been arguing [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=352.58s)]
*  for and describing an open convention since February. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=356.53999999999996s)]
*  And I still believe it would have been a good idea, the right idea. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=360.14s)]
*  What Democrats denied themselves over the past year with Biden was information. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=364.74s)]
*  He ran functionally unopposed in the primary. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=369.5s)]
*  He avoided debates and interviews and press conferences. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=372.36s)]
*  And Democrats didn't know until it was almost too late the toll age had taken on him. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  What a blitz primary leading up to an open convention would have offered them is information. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=382.5s)]
*  They could have seen how their candidates would perform. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=387.82s)]
*  But that is not what happened. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=390.7s)]
*  And in my conversations with top Democrats in recent weeks, I've come to the view that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=392.74s)]
*  it's not going to happen now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=396.98s)]
*  Biden did step aside, but it was a grueling, uncertain, painful month for the party. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=399.98s)]
*  This was difficult work, people convincing someone they loved that he had to leave. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=405.72s)]
*  The party is exhausted. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=411.3s)]
*  It is tired of its internal drama. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=412.92s)]
*  It wants to turn its attention back to Donald Trump. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=415.66s)]
*  It wants to raise money, build get out the vote operations, run ads. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=418.90000000000003s)]
*  And it feels above all that time is now short. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=423.58000000000004s)]
*  The convention is mere weeks away. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=426.98s)]
*  But something else happened during this period too. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=430.1s)]
*  Campaign strategists sometimes talk about the tangibles and the intangibles of candidates. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=433.66s)]
*  The tangibles are everything that is obvious about a candidate on paper. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=438.62s)]
*  Josh Shapiro is the governor of Pennsylvania, a swing state. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=443.7s)]
*  Mark Kelly was an astronaut, the coolest job in the world. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=447.38s)]
*  JB Pritzker is rich enough to self-fund a campaign. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=451.58s)]
*  But those intangibles are trickier, and you don't know them before you see a candidate [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=455.52s)]
*  running for office. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=459.5s)]
*  How do they respond to pressure? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=461.18s)]
*  Do they come off as honest and authentic to voters? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=463.44s)]
*  Or does something about them read as false and opportunistic? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=467.18s)]
*  Do they have that charisma, that ineffable something that convinces people to knock on [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=470.90000000000003s)]
*  doors for them, share memes of them, proselytize to family members about them? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=475.82s)]
*  Harris's reputation was as a candidate with the tangibles, but not the intangibles. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=482.78000000000003s)]
*  She was great on paper, but in 2020 she couldn't put the pieces together. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=488.18s)]
*  I remember watching her campaign speech and finding it hollow. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=492.38s)]
*  Our United States of America is not about us versus them. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=496.58000000000004s)]
*  It's about we the people. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=501.74s)]
*  And in this moment, we must all speak truth about what is happening. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=507.02000000000004s)]
*  We must seek truth, speak truth, and fight for the truth. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=514.1800000000001s)]
*  It was built around these cliché refrains, for the people, let's speak truth. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=522.22s)]
*  But then there was just this laundry list of democratic priorities. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=527.94s)]
*  There was no core to it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=530.82s)]
*  And that's how many in Washington saw Harris as a talented politician without the stable [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=532.94s)]
*  vision and message, without the why that powers the candidates who tend to win the presidency. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=538.26s)]
*  I've come to see that as a consequence, maybe a byproduct of the moment in which Harris [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=546.66s)]
*  ran because Harris's identity in California was clear. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=551.6999999999999s)]
*  She was this moderate, smart on crime prosecutor. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=555.9399999999999s)]
*  But that's not what the Democratic Party wanted nationally in 2020, not after Ferguson, not [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=559.86s)]
*  amidst Black Lives Matter, not amidst a moment in which criminal justice reform was dominant. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=565.5799999999999s)]
*  And so Harris tried to change who she was. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=571.26s)]
*  She foregrounded her life story, her Jamaican father, her Indian mother, their civil rights [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=574.1s)]
*  background, the unlikeliness of her being on the stage at all in this echo of Obama's [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=579.74s)]
*  campaign. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=585.3000000000001s)]
*  She, of course, was aware of Bernie Sanders' success in 2016. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=586.3000000000001s)]
*  So she endorsed Medicare for All, not again the profile she had in California. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=589.46s)]
*  But then she brought out a plan that I would say sensibly fell short of abolishing private [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=594.38s)]
*  insurance. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=598.6600000000001s)]
*  But that was a standard Sanders had set. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=599.82s)]
*  And so was she endorsing Medicare for All? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=601.74s)]
*  Was she not? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=603.84s)]
*  Was she triangulating? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=604.84s)]
*  She ended up satisfying no one. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=606.64s)]
*  In her biggest moment in the campaign, she attacked Biden for his past position on busing. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=608.94s)]
*  But she didn't herself have a very different position on busing. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=614.24s)]
*  What was that attack even all about? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=617.28s)]
*  Her candidacy had this tendency to feel tactical, not strategic, like she was switching between [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=619.46s)]
*  identities, not committed to a stable vision for the country. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=625.76s)]
*  She dropped out before Iowa. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=629.76s)]
*  There were other problems that dogged Harris, too. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=632.18s)]
*  Her Senate office was known to be badly run. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=634.62s)]
*  In the first few years, so too was her vice presidential office. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=637.7399999999999s)]
*  She had a reputation for burning through staff. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=641.38s)]
*  And she has few advisors who have been with her for long enough to really deeply know [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=644.2199999999999s)]
*  her. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=648.0999999999999s)]
*  And the Biden administration, they didn't set her up for success either. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=649.0999999999999s)]
*  They gave her impossible portfolios, like the root causes of the border crisis, which [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=652.42s)]
*  she never had the power to solve. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=658.5s)]
*  But over time, Harris found her footing in the administration. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=661.94s)]
*  She became its primary messenger on abortion and the Supreme Court. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=665.84s)]
*  She developed a steadiness in her presence on the campaign trail that she hadn't had [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=670.22s)]
*  before. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=673.6600000000001s)]
*  Since the night of the debate, Kamala Harris has been running a race of her own. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=675.1s)]
*  From the first interview she gave that night on CNN, where she made the case against Trump [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=679.0600000000001s)]
*  that Biden had failed to make, she has been in an almost excruciatingly delicate position [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=683.5s)]
*  of backing Biden absolutely while showing Democrats that she is fit to take his place [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=689.94s)]
*  atop the ticket. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=694.22s)]
*  And she has not misplaced a single foot. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=695.66s)]
*  Her speech has been searing and clear. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=699.1s)]
*  As many of you know, I am a former prosecutor. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=701.66s)]
*  So I say, let's look at the facts, shall we? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=705.66s)]
*  So Donald Trump tries to claim he brought back American manufacturing. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=712.54s)]
*  The fact is, under Donald Trump, America lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=718.46s)]
*  And more than 1,000 factories closed under his watch. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=728.22s)]
*  The facts. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=732.38s)]
*  Her interviews have been strong. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=733.5s)]
*  So I think that what Donald Trump is doing is grasping for straws. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=735.38s)]
*  And look, of the two people on that debate stage, only one of them has the endorsement [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=739.22s)]
*  of his vice president. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=743.7s)]
*  And let's not forget that. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=745.3000000000001s)]
*  Very awkward and very, very true. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=747.66s)]
*  She's been, if you've been watching, and I've been watching, much better than some of Biden's [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=750.66s)]
*  other eager surrogates at admitting the concerns about his performance while convincingly defending [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=755.38s)]
*  his record and taking the fight to Trump. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=760.74s)]
*  It is easy if you're doing that work to fall into a kind of Baghdad-Bob-like denial of [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=762.98s)]
*  reality, happy talk. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=768.98s)]
*  She's been walking that line very gracefully. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=770.98s)]
*  In Washington, the estimations of Harris's political skill and acumen had fallen sharply [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=773.86s)]
*  since 2020. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=779.62s)]
*  In the last few weeks, they have risen almost as sharply. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=781.14s)]
*  And at the same time, Trump's criminal charges and convictions have made her prosecutorial [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=784.42s)]
*  background appealing. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=789.06s)]
*  She's now battle-hardened and vetted in a way that doesn't really happen if you haven't [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=790.5s)]
*  had the kinds of national campaigns and periods in the political wilderness that she's experienced [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=795.6999999999999s)]
*  She's been up, she's been down, she's learned from both. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=801.7s)]
*  There are a lot of candidates who look good before a campaign but wilt under pressure. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=805.7s)]
*  Harris has been under enormous pressure this last month, and she's never faltered. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=810.6600000000001s)]
*  And then something happened that I don't think many would have predicted. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=816.26s)]
*  People got excited about her, about her, this vast array of very online socialists and liberals [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=820.26s)]
*  and Democrats and moderates all began proclaiming themselves coconut-pilled, making memes out of [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=828.5s)]
*  this quirky story Harris likes to tell. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=837.14s)]
*  My mother used to, she would give us a hard time sometimes and she would say to us, I [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=839.62s)]
*  don't know what's wrong with you young people. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=844.1s)]
*  You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=846.42s)]
*  You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=850.98s)]
*  Videos of her describing recipes circulate now on TikTok. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=858.1s)]
*  Her dances get set to music. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=861.22s)]
*  She's having these positive viral moments that Joe Biden just was not. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=863.78s)]
*  This sort of authentic enthusiasm that wasn't there before. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=868.34s)]
*  She's not just connecting because she can deliver an anti-Trump roundhouse. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=872.58s)]
*  She's connecting because people are connecting to something about her, something intangible. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=876.9s)]
*  And now the party is closing ranks around her. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=883.3000000000001s)]
*  Biden dropped out and he endorsed her fully. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=886.3399999999999s)]
*  Then Gavin Newsom endorsed her and Josh Shapiro endorsed her and Elizabeth Warren endorsed her [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=889.14s)]
*  and AOC endorsed her and Jared Polis, the governor of Colorado endorsed her and Andy [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=893.54s)]
*  Beshear, the governor of Kentucky endorsed her and the Tennessee State Democratic delegation [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=898.74s)]
*  endorsed her and the powerful labor union SEIU endorsed her and the list here could [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=903.4599999999999s)]
*  just go on and on and on. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=908.02s)]
*  Now the party converging around Harris doesn't mean Harris is a safe bet. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=911.3s)]
*  It doesn't even mean Harris is the right bet the candidate Democrats would draft if [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=916.1s)]
*  they were starting from scratch. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=920.66s)]
*  People argue here about the polling. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=922.9s)]
*  I don't find the polling on her very telling. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=925.14s)]
*  In head-to-head polling right now with Trump, she polls similar to maybe a bit above Joe Biden. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=927.4599999999999s)]
*  Her favorables and unfavorables are similar to maybe a little bit better than Biden. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=933.14s)]
*  I think that's to be expected. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=938.42s)]
*  She is his vice president. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=940.02s)]
*  She should poll like he does. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=941.86s)]
*  But Harris has never won an election atop the ticket in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin or [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=943.62s)]
*  Michigan. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=949.54s)]
*  She hasn't won any of those primaries. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=950.18s)]
*  She's never won an election atop the ticket anywhere but California. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=952.34s)]
*  The Biden administration's record Democrats have to be honest here. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=956.5s)]
*  It is unpopular. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=960.5s)]
*  People are mad about inflation. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=961.54s)]
*  They do not feel the effect of the Inflation Reduction Act or the bipartisan infrastructure [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=963.46s)]
*  bill. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=968.5s)]
*  And Harris cannot make a clean break from an administration that she was a vice president [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=969.54s)]
*  in. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=974.0999999999999s)]
*  Immediately uniting around Harris feels safe to some Democrats. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=976.0999999999999s)]
*  To other Democrats, it's unsafe. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=979.62s)]
*  It's risky. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=981.6999999999999s)]
*  They worry they're making the mistake they made with Biden, which is being so afraid [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=982.66s)]
*  of disunity that they're failing to gather the information they need to know how their [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=986.66s)]
*  candidate will really perform. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=991.54s)]
*  But here's the truth. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=994.26s)]
*  Everything right now is risky. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=995.4599999999999s)]
*  It could all go bad no matter what path is chosen. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=997.5400000000001s)]
*  But I do think there's a middle path here that Democrats aren't really considering [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1000.58s)]
*  what should. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1005.38s)]
*  Look, none of the top tier candidates are going to really challenge Harris for the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1007.0600000000001s)]
*  nomination. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1010.34s)]
*  What about some second or third tier candidates? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1011.94s)]
*  Let a few up and comers make their case against Donald Trump. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1015.22s)]
*  Let's see some town halls on MSNBC and CNN and yes, Fox News. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1018.74s)]
*  Let's see some multi-candidate forums. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1023.86s)]
*  Let's see voters asking questions of them. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1025.94s)]
*  Nobody's going to go negative on each other here. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1028.98s)]
*  But give the country a reason to watch a lineup of young Democrats, most of all Kamala Harris, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1031.22s)]
*  make their cases against Trump day after day for the next few weeks. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1037.6200000000001s)]
*  What I'm describing here is not really a contest. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1041.94s)]
*  It's not an open chaotic convention. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1044.98s)]
*  It's an exhibition. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1047.8600000000001s)]
*  Maybe the people who've endorsed Harris can participate too. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1049.78s)]
*  After all, she's going to need a vice president. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1052.26s)]
*  So maybe Whitmer and Shapiro and Kelly and Beshear, maybe they should be up there too. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1054.8200000000002s)]
*  The Democratic Party has been acting like a party for the past month. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1060.8200000000002s)]
*  Maybe it should show up in these next few weeks also as a party, not just as one person. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1064.9s)]
*  Maybe a little strategic ambiguity about what these candidate forums and voter town halls [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1070.42s)]
*  really are would be good. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1074.5s)]
*  It would create the kind of free media, excitement, and enthusiasm that we all need. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1076.5s)]
*  Excitement anticipation the Democrats could never otherwise get. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1081.3s)]
*  It would mean Trump and Vance don't know where to put their attacks that they would have a hard [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1085.86s)]
*  time breaking into a news cycle. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1089.7s)]
*  And by the way, when Donald Trump has trouble attracting attention, he reacts by getting [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1091.86s)]
*  outrageous, chaotic, aggressive, sloppy. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1097.1399999999999s)]
*  That too would be a gift to Democrats right now. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1102.1s)]
*  Harris would have to falter catastrophically to lose a nomination, but it would be good [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1105.3799999999999s)]
*  for Democrats and voters to see her win the nomination in public, not just be handed it. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1110.1s)]
*  It would help her sharpen her message before the convention. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1116.1799999999998s)]
*  It might convince those who still doubt her that she's the right candidate. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1119.3s)]
*  And if Democrats should have learned anything from the last year, it is that more information [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1123.2199999999998s)]
*  about their presumptive nominee is better than less. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1128.4199999999998s)]
*  If Harris really isn't up to it, they need to know that now. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1131.62s)]
*  But the point of an exhibition isn't fear or failure. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1135.1399999999999s)]
*  It is to showcase talent, most of all, the talent of the likely champion. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1139.38s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1145.14s)]
*  I think Harris is up to it. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1145.7s)]
*  I've been watching her speeches. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1147.7s)]
*  I've been listening to her interviews. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1149.22s)]
*  I think she's really changed as a candidate. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1151.86s)]
*  Maybe in some ways she's changed back. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1155.06s)]
*  I went back recently to read Harris's 2009 book, Smart on Crime. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1157.46s)]
*  It was a very different book than I'd expected. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1162.18s)]
*  I'm used to the gauzy, memoirish quality of quickie campaign books. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1164.9s)]
*  But Harris, in the opening pages, she speeds through her biography [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1169.14s)]
*  as if she cannot wait to be done talking about it. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1173.38s)]
*  This is a book not about her. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1176.5s)]
*  It is about policies and programs that she thought as a DA were promising to prevent [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1178.42s)]
*  and reduce crime, promising to make prison a place of rehabilitation, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1185.54s)]
*  rather than a place that turns out more hardened criminals. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1190.02s)]
*  But from those very first pages, there is a clarity to what Harris cares about, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1192.82s)]
*  about what she is trying to achieve that I really haven't heard from her [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1198.02s)]
*  since she burst onto the national stage. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1201.94s)]
*  Harris writes, quote, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1204.9s)]
*  Nothing is more important than how we choose to keep ourselves, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1206.74s)]
*  our families and each other safe. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1210.26s)]
*  A few pages later, she says, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1213.1399999999999s)]
*  Still driving me is a notion that safety is a fundamental civil right. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1215.54s)]
*  I like that. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1220.34s)]
*  Safety is a fundamental civil right. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1221.1399999999999s)]
*  She goes on, quote, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1223.3799999999999s)]
*  I believe that people have a right to feel safe on the streets and in their homes, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1224.82s)]
*  and they have a right to keep and protect the things for which they've worked. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1229.54s)]
*  None of that is earth shattering. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1234.98s)]
*  I'm not trying to pretend that it is. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1236.58s)]
*  But I've spent so long hearing Harris say that she is a prosecutor, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1238.98s)]
*  that she can prosecute the case against Donald Trump. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1242.74s)]
*  It was almost jarring to read a whole book about what she was trying to do as a prosecutor, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1245.78s)]
*  why she was a prosecutor. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1251.3799999999999s)]
*  Safety. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1253.78s)]
*  And it got me thinking about Donald Trump and about his convention [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1254.98s)]
*  and about what the case against him really is. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1260.02s)]
*  If you watch that convention, the case they made against Democrats [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1262.74s)]
*  was the Democrats can't keep you safe. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1266.1799999999998s)]
*  But if you actually think about the problems Donald Trump, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1269.06s)]
*  it's that Donald Trump is fundamentally unsafe. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1272.4199999999998s)]
*  He poses as a strong man, but he makes us less safe. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1275.86s)]
*  Our democracy is less safe under Trump. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1280.1s)]
*  The world is less safe with Trump cozying up to dictators. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1282.98s)]
*  We were less safe while Trump was bungling the response to COVID. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1286.8999999999999s)]
*  Fundamental rights have been erased because of Trump's Supreme Court picks. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1290.6599999999999s)]
*  The people that Donald Trump appointed to top positions in his first term, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1294.82s)]
*  the people he would appoint in the second, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1298.98s)]
*  they made and will make our water and our air dirtier and less safe. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1301.3s)]
*  They made and will make our financial regulations weaker. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1306.1s)]
*  It's all written down in Project 2025, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1309.22s)]
*  which is why Donald Trump is running away from this thing [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1311.78s)]
*  that his own top staffers wrote. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1314.82s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1318.26s)]
*  Americans know and sense this about Trump. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1319.3s)]
*  It's another one of those intangibles. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1321.86s)]
*  The guy is chaotic and he's threatening and he's out for himself. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1324.34s)]
*  Democrats sometimes fool themselves. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1328.82s)]
*  There are things people like about Trump, virtues people see in him, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1330.42s)]
*  but they get this too. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1334.18s)]
*  They get this part of him. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1335.86s)]
*  And then in picking JD Vance rather than Doug Burgum [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1337.62s)]
*  or Marco Rubio, Trump reminded people of that side of himself. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1341.3s)]
*  He didn't go for a comforting, steadying pick. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1346.34s)]
*  He went for an ideologue and an enforcer. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1349.54s)]
*  He went for somebody who sends the message [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1352.6599999999999s)]
*  that this time there will be nobody holding Trump back, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1355.46s)]
*  nobody to check him. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1358.82s)]
*  If you were worried about Trump then, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1360.4199999999998s)]
*  you should be much more worried about him now. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1361.86s)]
*  And that puts Harris in, I think, a pretty strong position [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1364.6599999999999s)]
*  to take back an idea Democrats have not been fighting for [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1368.42s)]
*  nearly hard enough in recent years. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1372.02s)]
*  No, I don't think Harris's ideas about crime from 15 years ago [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1374.42s)]
*  are the basis for a whole national campaign. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1378.42s)]
*  But safety, that actually is. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1381.22s)]
*  That's something Democrats should win back. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1384.3400000000001s)]
*  They should take it from Donald Trump. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1386.26s)]
*  And I think Harris could take that from Donald Trump. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1388.66s)]
*  And the time to show it is right now. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwET0YXe_M&t=1392.26s)]
