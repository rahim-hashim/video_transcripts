# The Conflicted Legacy of Mitt Romney
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Bh42EkwQw)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  Hey it is Ezra.
*  So we are working on a bunch of other episodes about Israel-Palestine and we also have some
*  great shows recorded that were supposed to come out if my book leave had lasted as long
*  as I had intended for it to last on some other topics and we're going to be releasing those
*  as events warrant.
*  So this one felt important to do right now.
*  It's between my colleague Carlos Zada and McKay Coppens on Mitt Romney.
*  McKay of course wrote the big new Buzzy Romney book that is out.
*  I think it shines some important light on what the Republican Party has become and what
*  that has meant for people who just a couple of election cycles ago were literally the
*  Republican Party's leaders watching Romney closely and seeing what has happened to him
*  and then where he has moved in response.
*  I think it's really interesting way to understand actually how far the Republican Party has
*  shifted, even though it is still called the same thing.
*  So I think there's a lot of insight here and I hope you enjoy it.
*  It's a weirdly fitting moment to examine the life of Mitt Romney.
*  Romney has been a governor and a U.S.
*  Senator as a member of the Republican Party.
*  He was even the party's presidential nominee.
*  And yet what he may be most remembered for is the moment when he broke with the GOP.
*  In February of 2020, Romney voted to convict Donald Trump in his impeachment trial on the
*  charge of abusing his power by attempting to persuade Ukraine's government to investigate
*  the Biden family. In that moment, Romney became the first senator in U.S.
*  history to vote to remove a president of his own party from office.
*  McKay Coppins, a staff writer at the Atlantic, goes deep on that decision and many others
*  Romney has faced in his new book, Romney, a Reckoning.
*  The book is in part the product of dozens of personal interviews, as well as access to the
*  senators' private journals, emails and text messages.
*  At a time when the Republican Party took weeks to even choose a House speaker and when it seems
*  eager to nominate a twice-impeached and four times-indicted former president as its standard
*  bearer, Romney's story feels retro.
*  He's the consummate institutionalist in an anti-institutionalist party.
*  And yet what's fascinating about Coppins' book is that the author pushes Romney to wrestle
*  with his own role, even his own complicity, in what his party has become.
*  As always, you can email the show with your thoughts and guest recommendations at
*  Ezra Klein Show at NYTimes.com.
*  McKay Coppins, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  So I have to read a lot of political memoirs and political biographies by journalists and
*  historians for my job.
*  What I love about this book is that you've written a book about the evolution of Mitt Romney,
*  right, his principled stance, his his implicit compromises along the way.
*  But it's also a book about the evolution of the Republican Party.
*  And there's some jaw-dropping moments here and there that I want you to explain in
*  greater detail. But first, let's start with some basics.
*  So the book is Romney, a Reckoning.
*  But I feel like there's multiple reckonings going on in the book.
*  What what reckonings are you focused on?
*  It's a good point. And I think that that subtitle was deliberately sort of multifaceted,
*  right? Because the way that this book began was that I had covered Mitt Romney for
*  a while. I had covered his 2012 presidential campaign.
*  I covered his speech at the Republican convention in 2004 when I was a senior in high
*  school. So I could say that I've been covering Mitt Romney for almost 20 years.
*  If you go back to my 17 year old son.
*  You've been covering that before it was uncool.
*  Yes, exactly. That's exactly right.
*  But, you know, I had profiled him for the Atlantic and I had kind of stayed in touch
*  with him. And after January 6th, I could tell that he was kind of going through something.
*  There was a kind of reckoning happening.
*  He was grappling with difficult questions about what his party had become, what was
*  happening to the country. And I sensed, though he didn't make this explicit at first, his
*  own role in all of this.
*  Right. Like whether he had played a role inadvertently in allowing the party to get to
*  this point. And so when I approached him, I basically said, I think you might be in
*  a unique position to be a really interesting subject for a political biography.
*  I only want to do it if you're ready to kind of fully tell all the stories.
*  Be candid, be straightforward, not protect your future reelection or whatever.
*  And he very luckily for me sort of took that as a challenge and started giving me his
*  journals and his emails.
*  And obviously in the last few years, he was known as this guy who was courageously
*  standing up against Trump and was sort of one of the last remaining bulwarks against,
*  you know, the spread of Trumpism in the Republican Party.
*  I knew that was going to be a crucial part of the story.
*  But how he got to that from being kind of known as a cautious, calculating politician
*  was the story I was sort of most interested in at first.
*  I want to get into that sense of his personality, right, that he was this cautious,
*  calculating guy. You have a great description early on of Mitt.
*  You call him a walking amalgam of prep school manners and Mormon niceness and the
*  practiced cool of the private equity set, right.
*  Which just like stuck in my head is like, yeah, that's Mitt Romney.
*  But you also raise something else that I hadn't thought about in connection to Romney at
*  all. And that is his anger.
*  Right. There's more than a few moments when you talk about sort of his, you know, this
*  deep well of anger, his temper he has to control.
*  When does that manifest itself and where does it come from?
*  That actually was something that I was surprised to learn about because the couple
*  moments that we've seen him be angry in public are sort of notable for how out of
*  character they seem. Right.
*  I mean, one of them is on the Senate floor on January 6th, standing behind Josh Hawley
*  as he's giving this speech. And there's this kind of famous clip of Mitt Romney sort
*  of glaring at him from behind two masks that he's wearing.
*  What I learned from talking to him and from reading his journals and talking to people
*  around him is that he does have this temper.
*  It was one of the early impediments to his kind of ability to win political debates
*  as a candidate. So when he was running for governor, he would do these mock debates
*  with his advisers. He hated them because in part he had smart
*  advisors like Beth Myers, who in Massachusetts kind of became his right hand.
*  And she realized, I'm going to try to get under his skin in these mock debates and see
*  what happens. And he would get so angry.
*  She would, you know, trot out these like attack lines.
*  One time he threw his notes on the floor.
*  Another time he said, well, if that's what it's going to be like, there's no way for me
*  to win. We shouldn't even bother.
*  He would really get, you know, kind of angry.
*  And, you know, I think part of it comes from his lifetime of privilege and wealth.
*  Right. He grew up in a kind of bubble where he wasn't challenged that often.
*  He also has sort of a quasi aristocratic conviction in like manners and
*  propriety. And he feels like when his sense of propriety is being violated
*  by somebody else, it really makes him mad.
*  It's like an indignation.
*  Yes, it's an indignation.
*  And that's kind of what was interesting about him as a character is that he has this
*  righteous indignation, but he can he can also be kind of judgmental of people
*  and and lose his temper.
*  And it doesn't always manifest in sort of a flattering way.
*  You had an enormous degree of access to Romney, just like his trove of emails.
*  Those private journals are amazing.
*  Right. Why do you think he was ready to do this?
*  And why do you think he's ready to do this with you?
*  I think it was a couple of things.
*  I think he realized he was at the twilight of his career, right.
*  For so much of his political career, he was focused on becoming president one day.
*  Right. And he now knows that's never going to happen.
*  So that that's part of it being freed from the constraints of trying to become
*  president. That matters.
*  He also was increasingly isolated in Washington and alienated from his party.
*  Something I learned about Mitt Romney is he really is a team guy.
*  Like, naturally, he wants to be part of a team.
*  He cultivated this close inner circle of advisors that stayed with him for decades.
*  You know, he's a partisan in the sense that he wants to pick a side and then be with
*  that side in some ways.
*  But he just couldn't get on board with the Donald Trump era of the Republican Party.
*  And because of that, felt increasingly isolated and was therefore not buffeted by the
*  machinery of partisan politics that would prevent him from kind of telling me these
*  stories. Right. He didn't really care what Lindsey Graham told him in the caucus meetings
*  or if Josh Hawley would get mad at him.
*  Like, you know, I think that was part of it.
*  But I will also say, like, it's not like he kind of arrived as a subject fully ready to
*  go this far. It was a two year conversation, over 50 interviews that took sometimes
*  me just kind of patiently listening, sometimes me needling him a little bit, challenging
*  him. He also, I mean, to his credit, put in a lot of time considering and reconsidering
*  questions that I asked.
*  Sometimes he would come back to me a week later and say, you know, you asked me this
*  last week. I don't think I fully answered you and he'd have kind of more thoughts.
*  But the other thing that's happened is that Mitt Romney, I write about this throughout
*  the book, is a person who has had a very keen sense of his own mortality for a long time.
*  And this goes back to, you know, a car crash that he was involved in as a Mormon missionary
*  as a young man. But especially, I think now he he's convinced that he only has at most
*  12 years left. And I mean, sometimes these conversations would take morbid turns where
*  I really didn't know how to respond. But the men in his family have a history of sudden
*  heart failure. His father is the one who lived the longest of any of them and he died at
*  88. So he's convinced he has at most 12 years left. But he's thinking more about how he'll
*  be remembered and less about how, you know, whatever he'll do will play in the next day's
*  new cycle.
*  You use this term a few times, the Romney obligation. What is that?
*  Mitt Romney has this kind of story that he tells about his family, which is that the
*  Romneys have this kind of overdeveloped, outsized sense of obligation to run toward a crisis
*  and to try to solve the problem that when they're called upon, or not even if they're
*  not called upon, but when there is a crisis that needs to be addressed, they feel like
*  they need to be there and be in the middle of the action, even when it's risky and even
*  when it's unpleasant. And he saw this in his father. He has stories going back through
*  his genealogy of, you know, various forefathers who also had this. And he feels a strong sense
*  of obligation, which has manifested in various ways throughout his career. I mean, one of
*  the most obvious is his takeover of the Olympics in Salt Lake City, right? At this time was
*  on pace to become a billionaire. Instead, he's convinced by his wife, Anne, and a couple
*  of other friends that the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City were in crisis. There had been
*  kind of scandals around financial mismanagement and bribery allegations, and, you know, advertisers
*  were fleeing. And he decided, well, you know, like, somebody needs to turn this around.
*  It needs to be me. And he walked away from really a lot of money. He could have made
*  a lot more money instead. And that was kind of the argument that Anne made to him. You
*  know, what do we need more money for? We have all the money we could possibly want. And
*  he went and took this kind of thinkless job that ended up propelling him to the Massachusetts
*  governorship. But one of the most revealing things I found in research about this period
*  was a quote that Anne Romney gave the Boston Globe at that time, which is somebody asked,
*  why is your husband doing this? You know, moving across the country to Utah to take
*  over these games. And she said, he loves emergencies and catastrophes. Which, you know, I asked
*  him about, and he kind of admitted that on the one hand, there's this strong sense of
*  obligation. On the other hand, he also has an adrenaline rush when there's a high stakes
*  problem to be solved that he can't really get anywhere else.
*  You mentioned his father. You dedicate a lot of time to George Romney, who seems by far
*  to be the biggest sort of influence looming over midlife. And often it's this kind of
*  inspirational presence. But in some ways, it also felt like a little reproachful. Like
*  Mitt is aware of the moments when he's not living up to George's legacy. How does George
*  loom over Mitt? The way I think about it, as I've spent time with him and George comes
*  up all the time in our conversations, in his journal, all the time in the book. It's amazing.
*  Yeah, you really like it. I put a lot of George in there. I could put a lot more. I mean,
*  there's a version of this book that it's like a biography of the two of them because
*  they're so linked in Mitt's mind, at least. The way I think about it is that he's both
*  inspired by and at times haunted by his dad's legacy. His father was pioneering auto executive,
*  then became governor of Michigan, was then seen as the likely next Republican nominee
*  for president, and happened to be running at a time when the Republican Party was taking
*  its rightward turn. Where you had Richard Nixon's campaign running the Southern strategy,
*  white grievance became an incredibly important part of the new and emerging Republican coalition.
*  But what makes George Romney so admirable is that he kind of emphatically stood against
*  the rising tide of racism and white grievance and refused to indulge it and in fact pushed
*  back against it in ways that were pretty politically damaging to him. He refused to
*  condemn the people who took part in the race riots in Detroit while running as a Republican
*  presidential candidate and instead delivered an address about how we need to look at the
*  root causes of these riots and white America needs to look within itself. He launched his
*  campaign with a tour of the American ghettos, speaking to the inner cities, posing with
*  left-wing radicals, arguing that we can find common ground. His campaign ended up melting
*  down though because of one interview that he gave, a radio interview, in which he was asked about
*  his changing position on the Vietnam War. George said that, I went over to Vietnam with a group
*  of other governors and the generals brainwashed me. And what he was trying to say is basically
*  the American military and the State Department were selling us a false story. They were spinning
*  him. And we got spun and now I've realized that I got spun and I've changed my attitude and now
*  I'm against the Vietnam War. But that use of the word brainwashing became a massive story.
*  George's campaign was actually already on the way down, but it was more the final nail in the coffin.
*  It was emblematic of George's problem as a politician, but also his most admirable trait,
*  which is that he just sort of recklessly said what he believed. What Mitt took away from that is both
*  my dad was a hero and the embodiment of integrity in politics and I wish that I could be like my dad,
*  but also the way to get elected president is to do the exact opposite. George was great, but he
*  blew it. And so what Mitt took away and he really internalized this lesson and made sure everyone
*  in his campaigns did too was we have to be hyper disciplined. We have to stick to the talking points.
*  We have to follow where our party's base is and we're not going to try to heroically change the
*  mind of Republican primary voters. We're going to do what's necessary to win. He took this so
*  seriously that when he first ran for president in 2008, he pulled a thesis, I believe it was a BYU
*  master's thesis, but somebody who had basically written about why George's presidential campaign
*  failed, printed it out and had all of his senior advisors read it. That was an amazing moment. I
*  just couldn't believe he had done that. But it shows how much George kind of loomed over Mitt
*  Romney throughout his career. Yeah, here it says the title of the 88 page paper was George Romney
*  in 1968, from front runner to dropout, analysis of cause. I mean, imagine like everyone on the staff
*  getting this 88 page, you know, master's thesis about like, here's what my dad lost and let's not
*  do that. Right. But it's just important to understand because for most of his career, he essentially
*  defined his approach to politics in opposition to his father. And really, I think the way he sees
*  his turn during the Trump era is a chance to finally reach for his father's legacy and live up to it.
*  Of course, the difference, the major overwhelming difference is that his father did that when the
*  stakes were the highest when he was running for president. And that's something that Mitt
*  didn't do when the stakes were the highest. And you know, it's funny, I think that
*  haunts him a little bit. And this was one of those things where I was always kind of pressing him to
*  think harder. You can tell, you can tell on the book that he, and he goes back and forth on it.
*  He does. He, you know, some weeks he, he, in our weekly interviews, he would seem like he was kind
*  of confessing complicity and, you know, the parties captured by these kind of extremist forces by
*  indulging them or not standing up against them. But then the other, another week he would be like,
*  yeah, but I think that might be too far. And he resisted for a long time. I mean,
*  there's one important moment that I think listeners to this podcast will think about,
*  which is Mitt Romney accepted Donald Trump's endorsement in 2012 when he was running in the
*  Republican primary. They stood on a stage together in Las Vegas, had a whole event built around it.
*  And this was when Donald Trump was becoming a right-wing political celebrity with this kind of
*  conspiracy theory about Barack Obama not being American. I want to come back to that moment. I
*  love what he says in the moment when he's up there with Trump. There are some things that you just
*  can't imagine happening in your life. This is one of them. Being in a, I love kind of witnessing
*  other people's awkwardness in real time, you know, and that was just one of the most awkward
*  moments in American politics in recent years. How did Romney rationalize that moment?
*  Yeah. So he, you know, first of all, convinced himself that if Trump didn't endorse him,
*  he'd endorse somebody else and it's better for the party, better for the country. If he wins
*  instead of Newt Gingrich or Rick Perry. God, he hated Newt. Some of the meanest quotes,
*  not just in the book, but that I've ever seen one politician say about another are about Newt
*  Gingrich. If that's a plug for future readers, I don't go ahead. No, but like, you know, he saw
*  himself as running against kind of a clown car of lesser Republicans and felt like he needed to win,
*  which is a very common rationalization in politics. He also believed that Donald Trump was
*  not a serious political figure, right? If Bill Maher and Kanye West can donate to and endorse
*  Barack Obama, why can't I have the apprentice host? Who cares, right? But the other kind of
*  interesting wrinkle to this is that as he spent time with Trump at fundraisers and stuff throughout
*  that campaign, he actually kind of liked Trump. You know, that he sort of enjoyed, he enjoyed him
*  around, he enjoyed the company. He still thought of him as a buffoon and he didn't take him seriously
*  as like a businessman or anything like that. And he thought his conspiracy theories were insane.
*  They have this kind of, there's this one scene where Mitt tries to like very patiently and
*  logically talk Donald Trump out of the birther conspiracy theory. He's like, no, no, no, what
*  you don't understand about constitutional laws. And like quickly realizes that Trump like has
*  completely zoned out and he was like, all right, nevermind. But in terms of just Trump as like
*  one-on-one, you know, guy who would call him sometimes on the campaign trail, it was fun.
*  And you know, I found this journal entry from 2012 where he kind of, Mitt kind of rhapsodizes about
*  hanging out with Trump and says, you know, they just don't make them like Donald Trump anymore.
*  And you know, he says he's entertaining and, you know, lifts my spirits on the campaign trail or
*  whatever, which I think, you know, when I brought it up with him, you know, I could tell he was kind
*  of chagrined by it. But he also, you know, said this does speak though to how Trump has gotten as
*  far as he did with the party, right? You get in the room with him and he's fun to hang out with and
*  he's charismatic and gossipy and he seduces people. And, you know, he also proves he didn't take
*  him that seriously, but that's the thing. He didn't think of him as like, certainly anyone who would
*  run for president. He just didn't think he thought he was like a, it's a gadfly. He's a gadfly. And
*  you know, that's how he rationalized it. This was though, one of those things that I think like,
*  even now, as he went through this whole kind of reckoning process, we still, I think, you know,
*  somewhat disagree on where he landed because as much as he's embarrassed by it in retrospect and
*  as much as he, you know, wishes he could take it back, he just fundamentally doesn't believe that
*  accepting Trump's endorsement and kind of welcoming him into the campaign in 2012
*  had that much effect on Trump's ultimate rise to power. Do you think it did? I think it's hard to
*  say, but I think there's more of a case than Romney will acknowledge. I think that standing on that
*  stage with him and making him part of the Republican campaign apparatus in 2012 introduced him to a
*  lot of people in the party. And I think just gave him a little credibility. I think Romney has a
*  plausible case that like, he ended up winning in this, like riding this crazy once in a generation
*  populist wave. And maybe that's true, but Romney won't fully say, I am, you know, responsible for
*  Trump's rise.
*  And you see it throughout mid-life in different key moments, especially in the political realm.
*  When did you first begin to understand that that would be a real theme of this book?
*  It's interesting because I both saw him doing it in real time and also listened to him discuss his
*  own impulse to rationalize. And so it became clear to me pretty early on that this would be
*  an important theme of the book. It was also frankly part of what made the book timely and
*  interesting to me, because I think we are at this moment in American politics that we would not have
*  gotten to, if not for hundreds of maybe thousands of people rationalizing things that were in their
*  self-interest. So to answer the question more directly, Mitt, I had heard him tell
*  student groups or his staff, if there's one piece of advice I can give you now with all this
*  hindsight that I have the benefit of now, it would be don't sacrifice your principles at the altar
*  of ambition. It's not worth it. There's this, a lot of this like, believe me, I know it's not worth
*  it. Kind of like there's an acknowledgement that that's something he did. Absolutely. And in fact,
*  that was one of the early conversations we had. I asked him, you know, I've heard you say this a
*  bunch of times. Can you give me some examples of when you did rationalize something in your own
*  self-interest or sacrifice your principles? And that became the beginning of a long running
*  conversation that kind of ran over the next two years, because he started with, he had some
*  immediate ones that came to mind. And not all of them are, I acted more right-wing than I was. In
*  fact, when he was running for Senate in Massachusetts and in for governor of Massachusetts,
*  he told me I pretended to be pro-choice when I really wasn't right. And he walked me through
*  in kind of fascinating detail, how he rationalized the position that he took, right? He dug into like
*  Mormon, you know, discourses on the issue and looked for loopholes that he could find and
*  really convinced himself that this was an okay position to take. But then, you know, later,
*  there were a bunch of times when he was running for president where he acted, you know, like he
*  had these right-wing positions that he really didn't. And part of it for him was that he is
*  not somebody who actually, I think, he disagrees with me slightly on this, but I write in the book
*  that he's not somebody who takes, places a high premium on unwavering dedication to certain policy
*  positions. Like, he thinks that on most issues, there are a range of reasonable positions and
*  what really matters is the execution. And I think implicit to that is, if it helps me get closer to
*  the White House taking one position over another, what's wrong with that? Right?
*  That's very pragmatist.
*  Yeah, and I think that's part of, you know, why he was always tagged with this like flip-flopper
*  attack because he ultimately just, that's not, he's not an ideologue. He doesn't have a firm
*  set of policy positions. I remember Anne Romney's convention speech when it wasn't about his beliefs
*  as much as like, no one will work harder than Mitt Romney, you know? Like, it was basically saying,
*  he's just going to outwork everyone, you know, because that's the kind of guy he is. So like,
*  what kind of Republican was he? And then what persona formed, as you put it?
*  I think naturally, you know, coming out from where he came from in Michigan and watching his dad,
*  he would have described himself in the early 2000s as probably a moderate, pragmatic,
*  pro-business Republican, right? Whose forte was budgetary issues, fiscal issues,
*  and stimulating, you know, job growth in his state and hopefully in the country, right? That in 08,
*  when he started running, he thought of himself as like, this is, you know, I'm going to make the
*  campaign about the things I want it to be about, right? It was, I had this kind of quaint idea that,
*  you know, the presidential campaign should be about the biggest issues that, you know,
*  that affect Americans. And it's going to be about what I think is important. And what he very quickly
*  realized on those stages was that that's not how you win a Republican primary. That's not how you
*  win a, you know, presidential election. You end up having to sell yourself out little by little and
*  reshape your persona. And I don't think that everything about him as a 2008 presidential
*  candidate was false. But I do think he was responding to crowds. And he kind of positioned
*  himself as the Reaganite right wing, even kind of culture warrior, because that was the path for
*  him in that primary race. And it came off as an authentic. One of the most interesting things that
*  I found in his emails was a long thread among his like, way too many Republican political consultants
*  who were working on that 2008 presidential campaign, where it was toward the end, it was clear that
*  McCain was going to win, Romney was going to have to drop out soon. And so it was now like
*  recriminations among the consultants blaming each other. This is why the campaign didn't work.
*  And what was really interesting is there was a contingent of consultants who were saying,
*  we need to do more to position him as the heir to Reagan. He's, you know, claimed the Reaganite
*  conservative mantle. And then Stuart Stevens, who was his longtime advisor said, the problem with
*  that is that he's not a movement conservative and people can tell he comes off as inauthentic
*  when we position him that way, we need to stop doing that. So there was this kind of like,
*  tug of war between these two sides. I think in 2012, when he decided to run again, he got to run
*  the campaign that was closer to what he wanted it to be about because economic issues work top of
*  mind. But you know, still there were all kinds of moments in that campaign that he wishes he could
*  take back. I think it's the 2012 campaign where Romney still thought that this campaign could be
*  about principles and expertise and competence. And Stuart Stevens is like, no, this campaign,
*  like where the party is right now, this is about identity and tribalism and grievance.
*  And if we're going to win, we're going to have to steal this nomination. Like that was a remarkable
*  statement because I think that there were there instances where Romney is still thinking that
*  the budget, you know, like he was like, the Tea Party is really about fiscal discipline, you know,
*  like, for real, are you for real? You know, and even his and Stuart Stevens is like, no,
*  that's not what this is about at all. And so 2012 felt like that sort of hinge moment where we're
*  sort of didn't quite understand or didn't want to understand what the party was becoming. Like
*  people say that it's remarkable that after Barack Obama, the country like Donald Trump,
*  I think it's even more remarkable that after Mitt Romney, the Republican Party nominated
*  Donald Trump, you know, like that transformation, the most polar opposite kinds of candidates,
*  right? With polar opposite worldviews in a lot of ways, the same party, and a lot of the same vote.
*  I mean, obviously, most of the same voters, that idea that I titled that chapter heist,
*  because that really was Mitt Romney's campaigns approach to the 2012 primaries was the only way
*  we win is by stealing this from voters who really don't like Mitt Romney, right? He's a Mormon in a
*  overwhelmingly kind of evangelical primary base. He's a Massachusetts moderate in a very conservative,
*  you know, party. And the only way we're going to escape here is sort of through like redirection
*  and a misdirection and trying to take voters minds off his various deficits. And, you know,
*  he ended up pulling it off. He won the nomination by the skin of his teeth. But in the process,
*  I think did so much damage to himself that it was hard to then win in the general election
*  against Barack Obama. Why do you think he wanted to be president? Is it just the Romney obligation?
*  Just like, I'm the guy who can fix things. There's a great scene when he's mad at his
*  campaign staffers for not coming up with like a message. Right? He's like, Obama has this whole,
*  like, you know, move forward thing, you know, makes me look backward. Like, that's really smart.
*  Where's my message? You know, like, I'm like, the message should come from the top, right? Like,
*  don't you have an idea of why you want to do this? He thought of the kind of lofty campaign message
*  as just like another thing you could outsource to your consultants. Right? And like, the reality is,
*  like, the reason you're running needs to come from the candidate. Right? Yes, the consultants can help
*  you dress it up and come up with the slogan, but like, you need to have the reason. And I think the
*  reason they struggled with that was because ultimately his reason for running was that he
*  just thought he was better than everybody else at fixing fiscal issues. Right? Like, and that's just
*  not like, it's not a rallying cry. It's not hope and change. It's like, you know, put the consultant
*  in charge for four years. He'll turn things around. But the thing is, that was genuine. It's
*  interesting. His most active period of journal keeping was in the 2012 campaign. And I think it's
*  because he thought he had a pretty good shot at becoming president. He wanted to be, you know,
*  ready to write a presidential memoir one day if he needed to. And so he kept a very detailed day-to-day
*  journal, which started out in sort of travelogue form where it was like, I had these meetings,
*  went to this state, whatever, and then quickly became a medium for like venting and catharsis.
*  Like at the end of a long day, he would, it was great for me. At the end of the day, he would,
*  he would take out his iPad. That's where he would write and just kind of write all his frustrations
*  with his primary candidates and his staff and Barack Obama and, you know, super interesting
*  stuff there. But you could detect in those journal entries, a genuine desire to help people. I mean,
*  part of the kind of campaign apparatus was like, they would bring out these people whose small
*  businesses had been destroyed or who had lost their homes. And so he spent basically that whole
*  year meeting with people who were really struggling in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. And he
*  really felt for them. And he knew that he couldn't really like emote in public because it would come
*  across as phony and he wasn't that kind of politician. But he did feel for them. And he,
*  and he, this is kind of the difference between people like him and, and me, frankly, is that
*  he has just this enormous outsized confidence in his own abilities. Like he really believed that
*  he could fix the US economy if he was just given the chance. Not only that he could,
*  that he was the only one. The only one who could. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Exactly. I remember I was
*  reading this book and I turned to my wife at one point and I was like, I know why Romney wanted to
*  be president. He just thought he'd be really good at it. You know, like, like, like that was,
*  you know, that was kind of it.
*  There's a moment much earlier in the book that is another one of those jaw dropping moments. He's
*  talking to a group of evangelical leaders in South Carolina. He'd been kind of realizing that like,
*  people think Mormonism is kind of weird and maybe this is hurting me. And then one of these guys
*  says to him flat out, like, if you become president, you will kind of normalize Mormonism and therefore
*  more people will go to hell. Yes. And not like go to hell as a metaphor. You know, he means like go
*  to hell. Capital H. And I kept wondering, you know, to what extent did he come to conclude it was a
*  hindrance overall in his political ambitions, but to what extent did it also drive him?
*  It's interesting for all of the flip-flopping he's accused of and all the kind of disposable
*  policy positions that, you know, he's demonstrated throughout his life, that his faith has been
*  non-negotiable from the beginning. Right. He had advisors in 2007 when he was running for president
*  the first time who said, you know, why don't you just say Mormonism is part of my heritage?
*  It's, you know, passed down by- Right. You want to give a speech kind of minimizing it, right?
*  Yeah. Why don't you just say like, it's not really, you know, I'm a Christian, you know, but like,
*  even Mormon stuff is just kind of part of my family history. And he was like, no way,
*  that's not happening. Even as he was having these conversations with evangelical power brokers and
*  ministers and voters who are making very clear that for them it was non-negotiable, right? Like,
*  voting for a Mormon to them, there was no way. And that 2008 primary was kind of traumatizing
*  for his family. I mean, I interviewed all of his, I talked to all of his sons and his wife, and
*  they have stories about just some of the things people would say to them on the campaign trail
*  in Iowa or South Carolina. It was kind of the first time that they encountered kind of like
*  visceral anti-Mormon sentiment from people. Because they'd lived in that community for so long,
*  right? Well, they'd lived in Massachusetts where there's not a lot of Mormons, but it's also a
*  pretty like progressive, inclusive place. Like, I know this because I grew up as a Mormon in
*  Massachusetts and you would get the occasional polygamy joke or whatever, but it was really just,
*  you know, first of all, mostly secular and people just didn't really care that much about your
*  religion. In places like Iowa and South Carolina, people care a lot about your religion. And on the
*  one hand, he wasn't going to disavow his religion, but he also had to keep seeking the
*  endorsements and votes of these people who manifestly hated his religion. And it's a,
*  you know, strange kind of indignity of politics that I think a lot of candidates are called upon
*  to endure. I mean, I think of Barack Obama certainly, you know, campaigning in 2008, like,
*  in a country as diverse and pluralistic as ours, like we ask our candidates to endure a lot. And
*  there's another scene later in the book where he goes to the values voters summit and he has to
*  speak right before this guy, Brian Fisher, who's like, you know, raging, like anti-Muslim homophobic
*  guy who's also said, you know, terrible things about Mormons. And Romney finds out that he's
*  speaking right before him and decides like, I need to push back against this rhetoric and
*  adds a couple of lines to his speech, pushing back against it. It gets a terrible response
*  in the room. He ends up coming in near last place in the straw poll at the values voters
*  summit. And he writes in his journal afterward, this is my seventh time coming to this summit,
*  smiling because it'll be my last. And it kind of gives you a sense of just like how much he hated
*  that part of campaigning. And yet in a generic sense, wouldn't like values voters be midst people.
*  That's what's so ironic about all of this. Like a Mormon Republican is about as value-centric as
*  you can have. And he lived a life where he was, you know, father of five, doting husband, never
*  been any controversy or scandal about his personal life, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, you know, like
*  he should have been the model candidate for these people, but because of their theological
*  differences, they just couldn't get past it. It's interesting to me how clearly Romney
*  despises campaigning, like throughout the book. He hates Iowa. And then he's like, when he has to
*  go back to Iowa again, he's so miserable, you know, like in some ways he's such an awkward fit
*  for politics. I remember there's a great moment early on, which like talk about like what if
*  scenarios, you know, where he's in college and he thinks he wants to get a PhD in like English
*  literature and wants to study Steinbeck and Dickens for the rest of his life. And some professor is
*  like, you'll be so poor. Just like go to business school, you know, you'll have plenty of time to
*  read books. Go to law school or business school. And then of course you went to both. Yeah. But
*  I mean, I do think that speaks to like Romney very at home in a conference room, a boardroom,
*  right? I think would have actually probably enjoyed a life of, you know, reading books and teaching.
*  He's really not at home on the campaign trail. And in fact, he's now pretty self-aware about it.
*  There's a funny moment. I don't actually think this is in the book, but where he was watching
*  Ron DeSantis campaign early in the current primaries. And he told me, you know, that guy
*  looks like he's getting ready to go to a dental appointment or something. And then he kind of
*  paused and said, kind of reminds me of myself, actually. Oh my gosh. He just, he never liked it.
*  He knows he's awkward. He can feel himself being awkward. But he also, the other thing is that like,
*  some of it is people assume a level of inauthenticity that actually isn't always there.
*  You know, when he ran for governor in Massachusetts, they ran this ad called Anne that was about his
*  like teenage romance with Anne and his like doting affection on his wife and voters hated it. And
*  they pulled it like very quickly because he came off as like plastic and too perfect and fake. And
*  people were like, there's no way that's real. It actually was real. That is what he's like with Anne.
*  And what he said to me is, I guess I'm the candidate who's authentically inauthentic.
*  He comes from a long line of wife guys. The Romney men love their wives performatively,
*  but also authentically. Last night in preparation for this conversation, I watched several old
*  Mitt Romney speeches. And one of the ones I watched was his 2016 speech denouncing Trump,
*  right? He almost seemed like he was having fun. And let me put it very plainly. If we
*  Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future
*  are greatly diminished. But you say, wait, wait, wait, isn't he a huge business success?
*  Doesn't he know what he's talking about? No, he isn't. And no, he doesn't. He's got this little
*  smile half the time. He like waits for people to laugh at his one liners, you know, like,
*  sometimes they don't, sometimes they do. But he just, he absolutely eviscerates Trump.
*  Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.
*  So given that, how on God's good earth does he take the meeting to become Trump's Secretary of
*  State? It just seems like such a contrast to everything he'd been doing. He'd been like,
*  behind the scenes machinations trying to like get Cruz and Rubio and Kasich to figure out a plan.
*  I mean, he'd been doing everything he could. You know, he decided this guy was this pernicious
*  force, a con artist, dangerous to the Republic. And then like, well, you know, but maybe I can
*  go work for him. Like, how did he come around to that process? I see that offer or kind of the
*  dangling of the Secretary of State job in front of Romney as sort of the last temptation for Romney,
*  right? Like he had taken this, you know, defiant stand against Trump and really reamed out his
*  Republican friends who got on board, Reince Priebus at one point I write about, goes to
*  MIT and says, okay, well, now that he's the nominee, like, can we get you on board? And he laughs and
*  Reince his face and says, Trump is nuts. Like, won't do it. So then Trump calls after he wins and says,
*  we want to meet with you about Secretary of State. Actually, Mike Pence calls him.
*  Who he also despises. He also despises Pence. He hates everyone. May hold grudges.
*  I said he's judgmental. So I think a couple things were going on there. One was, it's hard to remember
*  back then, but the immediate weeks after Trump won were genuinely scary for a lot of people. Like,
*  it felt like the world was going to spin off its axis, right? Like, we've never had like a truly
*  just crazy person. This is the view of a lot of people in the Oval Office. Like, what's going to
*  happen during that transition? During that transition period, there was a very strong
*  sentiment of we need adults in the room. Like, whatever you thought of Trump and his campaign,
*  we need to get as many adults in the room as possible. There were a bunch of people who joined
*  the administration in the White House at that time, with the very explicit goal of containing
*  Trump and making sure that the country stayed on track, right? So that definitely was part of it,
*  I think. And that speaks to the kind of Romney obligation, right? It's going to be embarrassing
*  if I do this, but I have to do it. And I should say, I write about how he got calls from multiple
*  former Secretaries of State, including Hillary Clinton, saying if they accept this job, you have
*  to take it. But there's another side, which is he wanted the job. He wanted the power. There's
*  a quote in the book where he says to me, you know, I wanted to be president. If you can't have
*  president, Secretary of State's a pretty good consolation prize, right? And so, and he was
*  clear-eyed about that with me now that like he was tempted by the position. And ultimately, he wasn't
*  willing to do what Trump and his camp kind of demanded of him, which was you need to fully
*  retract everything you said about me and say that I'm going to be an amazing president.
*  But he did, he did say something. He went as far as he could. Here's the line. This is page 189.
*  So this is after he has the meeting. He comes out, right? And he speaks publicly. He says,
*  what I've seen through these discussions I've had with the president, with president-elect Trump,
*  as well as what we've seen in his speech the night of his victory, as well as the people he
*  selected as part of his transition, all of those things combined give me increasing hope
*  that president-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.
*  Now, you put that statement alongside the speech he'd given just months earlier, denouncing him
*  in every possible way. And it's just hard to believe it's the same guy.
*  Yep. Well, once again, I think the rationalization instinct kicks in, right?
*  He basically convinces himself, I need to be in this room. I need to have this job. And so I'm
*  going to go as far as I can to try to get this job. And that was his audition, right? He gives
*  the speech. He gets a call shortly thereafter from Trump basically saying, that's not enough. You need
*  to go further. Romney can't go further. And that's ultimately where it falls apart. Now, subsequently,
*  people would claim that Trump was never going to offer him the job. This was just to toy with Romney
*  and to embarrass him. My reporting suggests that's not true. I think that Trump was seriously
*  considering him in part because if he could get some of his most vocal critics on board, then he
*  would look good. But I think that that episode was sort of the last temptation Romney had to join the
*  Trump train, right? And after that point, after he doesn't get it, and then after seeing what the
*  first hundred days of the Trump presidency bring, he's basically fully committed to being a Republican
*  critic of opponent of bulwark against Trumpism. When Romney decides to run for Senate, he reflects
*  on the Yates poem, the second coming and the best like all conviction while the worst are full of
*  passionate intensity. Did he see himself as the best? Did he see the Trump crowd as the worst?
*  What did that mean to him? That was the very explicit reference to that poem and that line
*  in particular was that the way he described it to be is the Matt Gaetzes of the world and the
*  Charlottesville marchers and the very worst elements of the Republican coalition are empowered and on
*  the rise and the people who know that racism is wrong and who know that authoritarianism is wrong
*  and who believe in the constitution and democracy and pluralism are being silent because they're
*  scared and they don't know what to do. And Mitt Romney saw himself as somebody who could come in
*  and be a voice for those people and hopefully in his mind empower them to speak up. He still thought,
*  let me get into the Senate. I was the nominee not that long ago. I was the standard bearer of the
*  Republican party. Let me see if I can get these guys to come back to their senses and speak up
*  in defense of traditional Republican values. And that ended up being a little more difficult
*  than he thought it would be. Of course, the other famous moment in that poem, right, is things fall
*  apart. The center cannot hold. Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. Did he think of himself
*  as holding up the center or was he still thinking of himself as a sort of partisan? The center,
*  I don't think he meant the center of the political spectrum. You probably saw it more as like
*  the center of the Republican party, the kind of mainstream establishment of the party. That's
*  what he was representing. Though this brings up, I think, an important point. Part of why he, Romney,
*  ultimately was able to kind of find his voice in these last few years is because the stakes of
*  American politics changed and the terms of the debate changed such that the things that we were
*  debating as a country were not marginal tax rates or deficit reduction. It was like, do you believe
*  in a pluralistic society? Do you believe in freedom of the press? Do you believe in kind of
*  these fundamental things that weren't really up for debate a few years ago and now seemed like
*  they were? And Romney, while he doesn't hold strong partisan positions on most issues, does hold strong
*  positions on those issues. And so I think that's part of why he now seems so kind of animated.
*  There's a moment when he's campaigning and he's asked in a rally or in some event, so like,
*  so are you going to try to shut down CNN and the New York Times? He's like, no, no, why would I do
*  that? He still seems constantly surprised. He's very generous with the benefit of the doubt often.
*  He wants to think the best of people and he wants to assume that everybody has good intentions.
*  I think it's why some of his critics might say he was ill-suited for this moment in politics because
*  assuming bad faith in people doesn't come naturally to him. But it is true that in,
*  so that was when he was running for Senate in Utah. And it was actually a clarifying moment for him
*  because this woman asked, like, what are you going to do to shut down major American news
*  organizations? And there was applause for that sentiment. And it was kind of a moment where he
*  realized the trickle-down effect of Donald Trump as president is that these Republican voters,
*  even in Utah, which was a state that was, you know, for a red state, pretty averse to Trump in 2016,
*  these anti-democratic ideas were taking root among Romney supporters. And it made him realize how
*  precarious this moment was for America. One thing that really stuck out at me is that once
*  he becomes a senator, his relationship to rationalization changes, right? You know,
*  you write that, you know, maybe after so many years of allowing the petty indignities and moral
*  compromises to pile up, he'd finally reached his limit. Also, you say the path to higher office
*  was closed now. Moral tests mattered more than they once did. I didn't know what to make of that
*  because in some ways it's great to see sort of Romney unleashed, you know, as senator. You know,
*  it's like his, his, his bulwark moment. He's just sort of saying what he really believes, right?
*  But to say that, well, now that the stakes are lower, right? Now that I, I won't be president,
*  I can really say what I think. And that to me conflicted with this other thing that Romney
*  says to you, which is that he was less pissed off at sort of true believers than he was at people
*  who were just kind of hiding what they really thought, you know? And yet, hadn't he been doing
*  that, right? If he's implicitly, he's, he's, he's admitting that he had because he's saying, well,
*  now that I'm in the Senate now, you know, and now that sort of any other high offices closed off to
*  me, now I can really kind of like say what I think. He might take issue with this characterization,
*  but to me, it's clear that part of the reason he's so judgmental of his colleagues who
*  say one thing in private and then take a different position in public
*  is because he recognizes a little of his past self in them, right? I think we're often most
*  judgmental of those who commit the sins that we know we commit, right? And I think that that's
*  part of what is going on with him. But I mean, implicit in this whole project that he embarked
*  on with me was the idea that he acknowledged he hadn't been fully candid or fully honest with
*  himself during those earlier years of his political rise. And so, you know, I think you could ding him
*  for that, but it's also true that as he's now taking stock of his career, he's being honest
*  about where he fell short. And I think it would be great if a lot more people would do that.
*  By the way, I'll just put it out there if anybody else wants to, you know, embark on a two-year
*  therapy session with me and then let me write a book about it.
*  McKay Coppins is available for regretful politicians everywhere. He does say it to you in a way that
*  sounds like Mitt Romney. He says, I think I recognize now my capacity to rationalize decisions that are
*  in my self-interest. There's a power in the admission, even if it's kind of a late in life
*  admission. Well, when he said that to me, it was when I asked him, would you have taken the same
*  lonely principled vote to impeach Trump if this had been, you know, decades earlier? And he thought
*  about it. And I remember we were sitting in his hideaway, his Senate hideaway office, a little
*  windowless room in the Capitol. And he thought really hard about that. And he gave me that
*  answer, which I thought was, you know, kind of remarkably honest. You know, for a lot of his
*  career, he was able to do what he thought he needed to do to win by convincing himself that
*  what was in his best interest was also the right thing to do. So last night, I also watched his
*  shorter 2020 speech, voting to convict, where he explains his vote to convict Trump in the
*  Senate impeachment trial. It is a remarkable speech. It's so different from the 2016 speech
*  where he's condemning Trump more broadly. You know, that speech was, it was almost fun, but this
*  speech, it is somber. It is emotional. When he talks about his faith, he chokes up, he has to stop.
*  I'm serious. As a senator juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice.
*  I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as
*  enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president,
*  the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not
*  wrong. It is a statement of high principle. I think it's a speech people are going to remember
*  more than his convention speech or his campaign speeches or that speech condemning Trump. I think
*  that's, that's the Romney speech. And one thing I was so struck by was something that happened just
*  before the speech. Ward kind of leaks out that he's going to vote to convict and he's going to
*  explain, and he gets a call from his former running mate, Paul Ryan, right? And the moment you bring
*  that up in the book, I naively assumed that Paul Ryan was going to be like, hey, Mitt, I heard you're
*  going to do this. I'm sure you wrestled with it. This is probably a really hard thing. I just want
*  you to know that like, I've got your back. I'm here for you. Like follow your conscience. But no,
*  the call was like, Hey, you know, I hear you're going to take this principle stand. Do you really
*  want to do that? Like, is that smart? Is that savvy? Should you like, I was shocked by, and maybe I,
*  maybe my, my expectations or aspirations for Paul Ryan or for the kind of running mate relationship
*  were too high, but I just, I couldn't believe that that happened. What did he make of that call?
*  So I should say first, Mitt was not the one who told me first about that call. Somebody else
*  in his orbit who knew about it, told me about it first. And then I, you know, brought it up with
*  him. And I brought it up with Ryan too, who, who confirmed the call, not necessarily the
*  characterization, but the essential details. The tenor, the fact that that's what he, yeah.
*  And that episode is so interesting to me because it showed truly how alone Mitt Romney was in that.
*  And that boat running me. This is his former running mate. And somebody he really loves,
*  like a son in some ways, like he, like Paul Ryan, people didn't want him to pick Ryan, right? Yeah.
*  He liked Ryan. He liked Ryan. He, he respected him. He felt like they had a kind of kindred
*  spirit thing going on. Like the policy wonkiness. Yeah, exactly. The budget, the budget. Yep. And,
*  and even, you know, like he, Paul Ryan would have like blended in with his like sons as like kind of
*  a dark haired, blandly handsome, you know, like a guy he really admired and respected Paul Ryan to
*  the point where he was much less judgmental of Ryan's capitulations to Trump than he was of other
*  Republicans. Sort of convinced himself like, you know, he was the speaker of the house. He kind of
*  had to do what he needed to do to, to get his agenda passed. And, but to have this moment,
*  I think where Paul Ryan calls him, Paul Ryan wasn't the speaker of the house anymore. He wasn't in
*  office anymore. He had really no reason to, you know, whip votes for Trump. So to do that,
*  I think showed just how out on a limb Romney was. There's another moment right before that,
*  where he tells his senior staff, Mitt Romney, that he's going to vote to convict. And one of
*  his senior staffers, she just puts her head down in her hands and doesn't look up for the rest of
*  the meeting because she's so like disappointed in him or disappointed in what this is going to mean
*  for his place in the party and maybe for her future, you know, career prospects. But like,
*  Romney was really, you know, did not have a lot of allies in this vote besides, I should say,
*  his family, which is ultimately what I think buoyed him throughout this whole process. Like,
*  in fact, there's a moment, because he goes, I have his journals from when he's
*  throughout that impeachment process, that trial, and he's agonizing every day over how to vote.
*  Every day he's considering the evidence and he tells Anne, he calls Anne and tells her,
*  I think I'm going to vote to acquit. And she says, I'm surprised by that. And she doesn't say
*  anything else, doesn't, you know, renders no judgment, doesn't argue with him. But he immediately
*  is like, Oh, I need to go back to the drawing board because he so much of him, his life has been kind
*  of dedicated to winning and keeping Anne's respect. And to a lesser degree, but still
*  important, his sons and he had talked it over with his sons and his wife and they all supported him
*  in this, but really not that many other people did. Yeah, it's interesting how many things he
*  tried to do behind the scenes, right? To stop Trump, both in 2016, also in 2020, he approaches
*  Joe Manchin about forming a third party. He was very active in that in that effort. It's funny.
*  It's one of those things whenever a Republican kind of speaks out against Trump, the immediate
*  kind of cynical response from a lot of people on the left is well, why didn't you do anything
*  about it? You know, like, we're words are cheap, you should do something. And I understand that
*  sentiment. There's been a lot of that. Mitt Romney is somebody who's actually done quite a lot,
*  not just, you know, the famous vote to impeach. But behind the scenes, you can, as I kind of show
*  in this book, he was constantly hustling to stop Trump in both campaigns. And I think the same is
*  true in this campaign as well. So you conclude with this scene about his father's obituary,
*  right? Some years ago, I think his daughter-in-law gave him the New York Times Book of the Dead,
*  which is a collection of sort of notable obits the paper had run throughout its history. And
*  he says, she knows I'm fascinated with this stuff. Among the hundreds of obituaries covering
*  celebrities, presidents, entrepreneurs and civil rights leaders, he looked for his dads. For Mitt,
*  no man loomed larger in history than George Romney. He was an icon, a legend, the embodiment
*  of integrity in public service. But George's entry was nowhere to be found. It bothered him at first,
*  eventually he made his peace with it. Even if history only writes one line about you, he tells
*  me you'd like it to be a good line. And when I read that, it struck me on its own. But then later,
*  when I watched his Senate speech, he ends with a very similar sentiment to your final line
*  in the book. He says, this is a Senate speech when he's explaining why he's voting to convict
*  Donald Trump. I will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations
*  of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among
*  the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong, grievously wrong.
*  We are all footnotes at best in the annals of history, but in the most powerful nation on earth,
*  the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.
*  Thank you, Mr. President.
*  That distinction is like the one line, right? You just want your one line to be a good one. So I
*  have no doubt that this book will go a long way to shaping how we perceive the legacy of Mitt Romney.
*  I hope that unlike his own concerns, he has many, many more years of life remaining. But what do you
*  think the first line of Mitt Romney's obituary will be?
*  I think history is a ruthless editor. I think that the more distance that we have from his life,
*  the less and less we'll be remembered about it. I do think, though, that whether it's his obituary
*  or history books 30, 50, 100 years from now, if he comes up, it will be for that moment of conscience
*  toward the end of his political career. That speech on the Senate floor, I agree with you,
*  will be the thing that if there's one scene that people remember from Mitt Romney's life and career,
*  it'll probably be that. I obviously think there's a lot more to say about him. I wrote a book about
*  him, but I think that if we could all be remembered for eventually reaching the best
*  version of ourselves, I think that would be wonderful. I think that would be fair for him.
*  McKay, this has been a real pleasure. We will end, as all episodes of this show end,
*  by asking you for three book recommendations.
*  Okay. I've got the three recommendations here. A mix of sentimental and plugging for a friend,
*  and then a little bit of self-indulgence. First, I'm going to recommend The Last
*  Politician by Franklin Foer. My colleague at The Atlantic just came out last month
*  about the first two years of Biden presidency. I think uncommonly well-written for an Inside
*  the White House story and revealed things about the president that I didn't know and kind of his
*  character that have stuck with me. Number two, Number the Stars by Lois Lowry. This is a shout
*  out to my fifth grade daughter, my oldest daughter, who read this book last year. It's about a Jewish
*  family's escape from Denmark during World War II. She started reading this book in school,
*  was obsessed with it, and said, Dad, you have to read it with me so that we can talk about it.
*  I started reading it with her. A lovely book, a really touching story. I would just say,
*  also given current events, understanding the persecution of Jews and anti-Semitism for a child,
*  it was a good opening point for those conversations. The last one I cheated,
*  but I feel like it's okay because I've heard you... I think others have cheated on this question too.
*  It's actually three books all on the same theme. The Plot by Jean Honf Coralettes, Hell of a Book
*  by Jason Mott, and Less by Andrew Sean Greer. All three novels published in the last few years
*  about writers embarking on book tours. Very different stories. I've read Less. It's amazing.
*  It's very funny and heartwarming and beautiful. In some of them, murders happen. In some of them,
*  existential crises happen. In some of them, moments of enlightenment occur. Less is the
*  one I read most recently and I just couldn't put it down. I read the sequel, Less is Lost.
*  But as a author embarking on a book tour, I'm now hoping that I have as
*  exciting an experience as these three fictional characters.
*  Michael Coppens, author of Romany or Reckoning. Thank you so much for being on the show.
*  Thanks for having me, Carlos.
