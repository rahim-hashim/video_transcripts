# This Taught Me a Lot About How Decarbonization Is Really Going
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [July 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmPeoo-JW_U)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  I'm excited about today's episode.
*  We're getting really into the Inflation Reduction Act weeds.
*  Before we begin, we're doing our quarterly Ask Me Anything.
*  This is going to be the last Ask Me Anything before I go on book leave.
*  I'll say, I guess, more about the book leave in a coming episode.
*  But if you've got questions you'd like to hear answered on the show, send them to
*  EzraKleinshowe at NYTimes.com with AMA in the headline so we know what they're about.
*  Again, send your questions with AMA in the headline to EzraKleinshowe at NYTimes.com.
*  But today we are getting into the Inflation Reduction Act.
*  And there's a kind of meta point I want to make here.
*  I've covered a lot of policy fights and a huge problem in how policy coverage is done
*  is there's all this attention to the fight to pass the bill.
*  The Affordable Care Act, the Trump tax cuts, the Inflation Reduction Act, and then the
*  bill passes and if the fight stops, attention just drops off a cliff.
*  Implementation matters, but it's harder to cover because it's happening in all parts
*  of the country simultaneously.
*  There isn't a huge Republican-Democratic fight over it, so there isn't the conflict
*  that draws the attention to it.
*  And so we sort of implicitly treat policy like it's this binary one-zero condition.
*  One, you pass a bill and the thing is going to happen.
*  Zero, you didn't and it won't.
*  But there's actually this huge range of outcomes in between where the thing passes and maybe
*  what you wanted to have happen happens, maybe it doesn't.
*  Implementation is where all this rubber meets the road.
*  And that's particularly true in the IRA, which has to build all these things in the
*  real world.
*  I mean, we're not just sending out checks here.
*  We're building transmission lines and green hydrogen manufacturing facilities and trying
*  to create a national network of electric vehicle chargers and on and on and on.
*  I mean, we're trying to do industrial physical transformation at a speed and scale unheralded
*  in American history.
*  This is bigger than anything we have done at this speed ever.
*  And so I want to keep on this and I want to keep on the question of how is it going?
*  The money is beginning to move out the door now, but we're on a clock.
*  Climate change is not like some other issues where if you don't solve it this year, it
*  is exactly the same to solve it next year.
*  This is an issue where every year you don't solve it, the amount of greenhouse gases in
*  the atmosphere builds, warming builds, the effects compound, and it gets harder or frankly
*  more impossible to solve over time.
*  Well, frankly, isn't the right word there because all we can do is abate a lot of the
*  problems now baked in.
*  So how is it going?
*  And who can actually walk us through that?
*  Robinson Meyer is the founding executive editor of heatmap.news, which is a new publication
*  that is doing great work focusing on the green energy transition.
*  He's also a contributing writer to New York Times opinion.
*  And he's been doing for a long time now, I think some of the best work covering what
*  the IRA is, how it's going and just the sheer messy, difficult task of actually decarbonizing.
*  So I wanted him to come on the show and walk us through where the law is right now in its
*  implementation process.
*  And what are the hurdles, the challenges between here and some semblance of success?
*  And he really does.
*  He really does.
*  So I learned a lot in this.
*  I hope you will too.
*  As always, my email for guest suggestions for feedback and again for asking me anything
*  questions is Ezra Klein show at ny times.com.
*  Robinson Meyer, welcome to the show.
*  Absolutely.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  So the Inflation Reduction Act passed last August.
*  Obviously it's early when you're building big renewable energy projects, they take some
*  time.
*  But what can we say has happened or is happening?
*  What concretely can we see where we can track how it's going?
*  And what do we just not know about yet?
*  You can almost divide the law up into different kind of sectors, right?
*  You have the renewable build out, you have EVs, you have carbon capture, you have all
*  these other decarbonizing technologies the law is trying to encourage.
*  Where we have the best data right now is in EVs.
*  Electric vehicles.
*  And in the effort, kind of this dual effort in the law to both encourage Americans to
*  buy and use electric vehicles and then also to build a domestic manufacturing base for
*  electric vehicles.
*  And I think on both counts, the data is really good on electric vehicles.
*  And that's where we're getting the fastest response from industry and the clearest response
*  from industry to the law.
*  And when you say the data is good, what are you seeing that's good?
*  The factories are getting planned, steel is going in the ground, the financing for those
*  factories is locked down.
*  It seems like they're definitely going to happen.
*  They're permitted.
*  Companies are excited about them.
*  Large Fortune 500 automakers are confidently and with certainty planning for an electric
*  vehicle future.
*  And they're building the factories to do that in the United States.
*  They're also building the factories to do that, not just in blue states.
*  And so to some degree, we can see the political certainty for electric vehicles going forward.
*  I think in other parts of the law, partially due to just like vagaries of how the law is
*  being implemented, tax credits that where the fine print hasn't worked out yet, it's
*  too early to say whether the law is working and how it's going and whether it's going
*  to accomplish its goals.
*  But there's some very encouraging signs.
*  There's some things we don't know yet.
*  So one oddity about the Inflation Reduction Act, or at least the climate side of it, is
*  we don't really know how big it is.
*  I always find this very funny in a way.
*  The Congressional Budget Office scored it.
*  They thought it would make about $380 billion in climate investments over a decade.
*  So then you have all these other analyses coming out.
*  So the Rhodium Group, which is a consulting firm, they think it could be as high as $522
*  billion, which is a big difference.
*  Then there's this Goldman Sachs estimate, which the administration loves, where they
*  say they're projecting $1.2 trillion in incentives, which I can't even quite figure out what they
*  were saying was happening there.
*  But that's a much bigger number than $380.
*  So why do all these numbers differ so much?
*  How big is this thing?
*  All the numbers differ because most of the important incentives, most of the important
*  tax credits and subsidies in the IRA are uncapped.
*  There's no limit to how much the government might spend on them.
*  All that matters is that some private citizen or firm or organization comes to the government
*  and is like, hey, we did this.
*  You said you'd give us money for it.
*  Give us the money.
*  We really don't know and kind of rely on these large scale national energy system models
*  to estimate what the uptake for these things may be.
*  We don't really know how many people are going to take advantage of each Sachs credit.
*  And so because of that, different banks have their own energy system models, their own
*  models of the economy.
*  Different research groups have their own models.
*  And that's why you produce these estimates that range from like $300 billion to like
*  $1.2 trillion.
*  One thing we do know pretty confidently is that the initial CBO estimate is probably
*  going to be wrong.
*  The initial CBO estimate, I think, is $391 billion, right?
*  I've seen different versions of $380 billion, something in that neighborhood.
*  And it also maybe $369 billion.
*  And I think it also depended on like what exactly you counted as a climate incentive
*  in the bill.
*  We know that's going to be wrong.
*  And we know it's going to be wrong because the Congressional Budget Office is actually
*  quite constrained in how it can predict how these tax credits are taken up.
*  And it's constrained by like the technology that's out there in the country right now.
*  For instance, the CBO really didn't see a very large take up for the hydrogen tax credits.
*  Hydrogen is this important tool that's going to be used in the industrial sector, maybe
*  transportation sector to like decarbonize and replace fossil fuels in certain uses.
*  Very generous tax credits for it in the IRA.
*  The CBO can only look at the number of electrolyzers, kind of the existing hydrogen infrastructure
*  in the country and be like, well, they're probably all going to use these tax credits.
*  And so I think they said that there'd be about $5 billion of take up for the hydrogen tax
*  credits.
*  Now, depending on other numbers, including DOE, it's potentially as high as $100 billion.
*  But that's because the whole thing about the IRA is it's meant to encourage the buildout
*  of this hydrogen infrastructure.
*  It's meant to encourage this technology to get built out.
*  So the reason I ask about these estimates is when I talk to the administration, one
*  thing they are excited about, one thing the authors of this law are excited about, they're
*  getting these estimates which have some information coming into them from private sector take
*  up.
*  And the fact that the estimates are going up is to them early evidence that this is
*  going well.
*  There is a lot of applications, people want the tax credits, they want to build these
*  new factories, et cetera.
*  But right now, what we mostly have to the extent we have any information about it at
*  all is people applying to get money.
*  And a huge fallacy that we make in policy all the time is assuming that once money is
*  allocated for something, you get the thing you're allocating the money for.
*  Noah Smith, the economics writer likes to call this checkism that money equals stuff.
*  But sometimes money gets allocated and then costs overrun and there are delays and you
*  can't get the permits and so on and the thing never gets built.
*  So I want to talk through the road from this money to all of this decarbonization infrastructure
*  they're trying to build.
*  I think the place to start is maybe with where a bunch of the money is going out the door.
*  I don't think people think a lot about who is cutting these checks, but a lot of it is
*  happening in this very obscure office of the Department of Energy, the loan program office,
*  which has gone from having 40 billion in lending authority, which is already a big boost over
*  it not existing a couple of decades ago, to 400 billion dollars in loan authority.
*  G. Gar Shah, who is not like a household name, but has become a very, very important figure
*  in climate money.
*  Tell me a bit about the loan program office and your sense of how they're doing.
*  Yeah.
*  And so in some ways I think you're right to focus on the loan program office as one of
*  the best places we've dated on how this is going right now and one of the offices that's
*  responded fastest to the IRA.
*  So the loan program office is basically the Department of Energy's in-house bank.
*  And it's kind of the closest thing we have in the U.S. to what exists in other countries
*  like Germany, which is like a state development bank that funds projects that are eventually
*  going to be profitable.
*  But because of how they have to be financed or because of they're so expensive or because
*  of like the interest rates they need, private capital isn't willing.
*  It has existed for some time.
*  I mean, it first kind of was first to play or after the Recovery Act of 2009.
*  And in fact, kind of early in its life, it gave a very important loan to Tesla.
*  It kind of gave this almost like bridge loan to Tesla that helped Tesla build up manufacturing
*  capacity and that got Tesla to where it is today.
*  And the IRA received a huge bonus in the IRA.
*  Like, as you said, it...
*  Well, wait a sec.
*  It didn't only give loan to Tesla.
*  Yes.
*  That's not the loan people know that it gave.
*  Yes.
*  It also lent to Solyndra, which, of course, went belly up and failed and became a huge
*  issue in the 2012 election.
*  The reason I bring that up is not to embarrass the office.
*  No, no, no.
*  I mean, it's because one of the questions I have about that office and that you see
*  in some of the coverage of them is they're very afraid of having another Solyndra.
*  They are.
*  They want that and not wanting that and putting every application through a level of scrutiny
*  high enough to try and make sure you don't have another one.
*  The Solyndra, as many people have noted, the issue is not that their technology failed.
*  The issue is that China subsidized solar manufacturing so much it became non-cost competitive.
*  But nevertheless, they don't want another of those.
*  And on the one hand, maybe that's good.
*  They're watching over taxpayer dollars.
*  On the other hand, maybe that means they don't make loans quick enough.
*  They don't make loans that are risky enough.
*  There's a Times profile of Jigar Shah and he's bragging in it that they're turning a profit.
*  I'm never that excited when I see a government loans program turning a profit because I think
*  that tends to mean they're not making risky enough loans.
*  The point of the government should be to bear quite a bit of risk.
*  The private market can't.
*  So that's the meta question I'm asking here.
*  Are they operating too much, in your view, because you're tracking this much closer than
*  I am, are they too much under the shadow of Solyndra?
*  Are they being too cautious?
*  Are they getting money out fast enough?
*  Are they getting money to big enough bets?
*  You're absolutely right that this is the key question.
*  They gave this $9.2 billion loan to Ford to build these EV battery plants in Kentucky
*  and Tennessee.
*  It's the largest loan in office's history.
*  It actually means that the investment in these factories is going to be entirely covered
*  by the government, which is great for Ford and great for our build out of EVs.
*  And to some degree, I should say one of the roles of LPO and one of the roles of any kind
*  of state development bank, right, is to loan to these big factory projects that, yes, may
*  eventually be profitable, may in fact, assuredly be profitable, but just aren't there yet or
*  need financing that the private market can't provide.
*  That being said, they have moved very slowly, I think, and they feel like they're moving
*  quickly.
*  They just got out new guidelines that are supposed to streamline a lot of this.
*  Their core programs, they just redefined and streamlined in the name of speeding them up.
*  So far, LPO has been quite slow in getting out new loans.
*  One of the things that I've seen in the reporting here, and this would take nothing away from
*  the office, I want to say that the pressure they're under is very real.
*  So, Linda was a disaster for the Department of Energy, whether that was fair or not fair.
*  There's a real fear that if you make a couple bad loans that go bad in a big way, you will
*  destroy the political support for this program and the money will be clawed back.
*  A future public administration will wreck the office, whatever it might be.
*  So, they're not operating.
*  This is not an easy call.
*  But one thing you hear from the companies that have gotten loans is like, this is a
*  grueling process.
*  And the ones who get it speak positively of it, right?
*  This is very thorough.
*  It's really hard, but it does mean you get both the money and this wonderful imprimatur
*  of the government and this thorough checkup.
*  But when you tell me they just made the biggest loan in their history to Ford, I'm not saying
*  you shouldn't lend any money to Ford.
*  But when I think of what is the kind of company that cannot raise money on the capital markets,
*  the one that comes to mind is not Ford.
*  They have made loans to a number of more risky companies than Ford.
*  But in addition to speed, do you think they're taking bets on the kinds of companies that
*  need bets?
*  It's a little bit hard for me to believe that it would have been impossible for Ford to
*  figure out how to finance factories.
*  That just can't be true.
*  Now I guess what I would say about that is that Ford is, let's go back to why Solyndra
*  failed, right?
*  She failed because Chinese solar deluged the market.
*  Now why did Chinese solar deluge the market?
*  Because there's such a port of Chinese financing from the state for massive solar factories
*  and massive scale.
*  And to some degree, Ford now has to compete.
*  And U.S. automakers are trying to catch up with Chinese EV automakers.
*  And its firms have EV battery technology especially, but just have a kind of comprehensive understanding
*  of the EV supply chain that no other country's companies have.
*  And so to some degree, I do want to like...
*  Maybe that's the argument for giving Ford that money.
*  I think that's right.
*  Is that basically if we think the U.S. should stay competitive and stay as close as it can
*  and not even stay competitive, but catch up with Chinese companies, it is going to require
*  kind of large scale state support of manufacturing.
*  Okay, that's fair.
*  I will say in general, there's a constant thing you find reporting on government, that
*  people in government feel like they are moving very quickly because given the procedural
*  work they have to go through and they often are moving very quickly compared to what has
*  been done in that respect before compared to what they have to get over.
*  They are working weekends, they are working nights, and they are still not actually moving
*  that quickly compared to what a VC firm can do or an investment bank or someone else who
*  doesn't have the weight of congressional oversight committees potentially calling you in and
*  government procurement rules and all the rest of it.
*  I think that's a theme across the government's implementation of IRA right now is that generally
*  the government feels like it's moving as fast as it can and if you look at the Department
*  of Treasury, they feel like we are publishing, you know, basically the way that most of the
*  IRA subsidies work is that they will eventually be administered by the IRS.
*  But first, the Department of the Treasury has to like write the guidebook for all these
*  subsidies, right?
*  So the law says there's a very general kind of, you know, here's thousands of dollars
*  for EVs under this circumstance.
*  The IRS still has to go in and like write all the fine print.
*  The Department of Treasury is doing that right now for each tax credit and they have to do
*  that before anyone can claim that tax credit to the IRS.
*  Treasury feels like it's moving extremely quickly.
*  It basically feels like it's completely at capacity with these and it sequenced these
*  so it feels like it's getting out the most important tax credits first.
*  Private industry feels like we need certainty.
*  It's almost a year since the law passed and you haven't gotten us like the domestic content
*  bonus, you haven't gotten us the community solar bonus, you haven't gotten us all these
*  things yet.
*  So the IRS came out but like generally I think a theme across the government right now is
*  that the IRA passed.
*  Agencies have to write the regulations for all these tax credits.
*  They feel like they're moving very quickly and yet companies feel like they're not moving
*  fast enough.
*  And that's how we get to this point where we're 311 days out from the IRA passing and
*  you're like, well, hasn't made a big difference?
*  I'm like, well, you know, frankly, wind and solar developers broadly don't feel like they
*  have the full understanding of all the subsidies they need yet to begin making the massive
*  investments.
*  So one of the tensions I'm getting at here with the loan office is a question between
*  what might have happened without the IRA, right?
*  Investments that had a little bit more of a sure thing dynamic and things that are much
*  more speculative and where the government is trying to backstop an innovation structure
*  or take out the risk of something that might not otherwise happen if they didn't.
*  And I think it's fair to say maybe the biggest bet on that is green hydrogen.
*  If you're looking in the bill, I mean, electric vehicles, I think what happens sooner or later,
*  they're trying to make them happen sooner.
*  But green hydrogen is something new and the size of the bet is huge.
*  So can you talk about first list?
*  What is green hydrogen?
*  Because my understanding of it is spotty.
*  And then what's the IRA doing?
*  What seems to be happening?
*  Like, why is it so important to this bill?
*  That's a place where I think they're doing something.
*  They really have a point of view that might not have happened in another administration.
*  Walk me through it.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  So green hydrogen and let's just actually talk about hydrogen broadly as this potential
*  tool in the kind of decarbonization toolkit.
*  A molecule.
*  It's a molecule.
*  See, I know something.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  It's a molecule.
*  It is a very light element and you can burn it, but it's not a fossil fuel.
*  And a lot of the importance of hydrogen kind of comes back to that attribute of it.
*  So when we look at sectors of the economy, they're going to be quite hard to decarbonize.
*  And that's because there is something about fossil fuels chemically that is essential
*  to how that sector works, either because they provide combustion heat and steelmaking or
*  because fossil fuels are actually a chemical feedstock where the molecules in the fossil
*  fuel are going into the product or because fossil fuels are so energy dense that like
*  you can carry a lot of energy while actually not carrying that much mass.
*  So in any of those places, that's where we look at hydrogen as going.
*  We think it's going to be important to our industry.
*  It may be an important tool for kind of storing energy in the power grid.
*  It may be an important tool for anything that needs combustion.
*  The IRA is extremely generous, like extremely, extremely generous in its hydrogen subsidies.
*  And there's actually two different subsidies to care about in the law.
*  The first is for what's called blue hydrogen, which is hydrogen made from natural gas, where
*  we then capture the carbon dioxide that was released from that process and pump it back
*  into the ground.
*  That's one thing that subsidized it basically subsidized as part of this broader set of
*  packages targeted carbon capture.
*  There's another thing called green hydrogen, which is where we take water, use electrolyzers
*  on it, basically zap it apart, take the hydrogen from the water, and then use that as a fuel.
*  The IRA subsidies for green hydrogen specifically, which is the one with water and electricity,
*  are so generous that relatively immediately it's going to have a negative cost to make
*  green hydrogen.
*  It will cost less than zero dollars to make green hydrogen.
*  The government is going to fully cover the cost of producing it.
*  That is intentional because what needs to happen now is that green hydrogen moves into
*  places where we're moving using natural gas, other places in the kind of industrial economy,
*  and it needs to be price competitive with those things with natural gas, for instance.
*  So as it kind of is transported, it's going to cost money as it actually, you know, you
*  make the investment to replace the technology, it's going to cost money.
*  And so as the hydrogen moves through the system, it's going to wind up being kind of price
*  competitive with natural gas.
*  But the subsidies and the bill are so generous that hydrogen will cost less than zero dollars
*  to make a kilogram of it.
*  Do we actually know how to make and use green hydrogen at this level?
*  Because my sense of the bill is its view is that this is one of these technologies on
*  the cusp.
*  We're trying to create these big hydrogen innovation hubs that unlike EVs say, where
*  yeah, more innovation is great, but we know how to make an electric car.
*  There seems to be a sense that hydrogen, green hydrogen, is something we sort of know how
*  to make, but we don't know how to make it cost competitive yet.
*  We don't know how to infuse it into all the processes that need to be infused into.
*  And so a place where the IRA is trying to create a reality that does not yet exist is
*  a reality where green hydrogen is widely used.
*  We have to know how to use it, etc.
*  And they just seem to think we don't.
*  And so you need all these factories, you need all this innovation.
*  They have to create a whole innovation and supply chain almost from scratch.
*  Is that right?
*  That's exactly right.
*  There's a great Department of Energy report that I would actually recommend anyone interested
*  in this read called the Lift-Off Report for Clean Hydrogen.
*  They made it for a few other technologies.
*  It's a hundred page book.
*  That's basically how the DOE believes we're going to build out a clean hydrogen economy.
*  And of course, that is policy in its own right, because the DOE is saying, here's the years
*  we're going to invest to have certain infrastructure come online.
*  Here's what we think we need.
*  That's kind of a signal to industry that everyone should plan around those years as well.
*  It's a great book.
*  It's like the best piece of industrial policy I've actually seen from the government at
*  all.
*  But one of the points it makes is that you're going to make green hydrogen.
*  You're then going to need to move it.
*  You're going to need to move in a pipeline or maybe a truck or maybe in storage tanks
*  that you then cart around.
*  Once it gets to a facility that uses green hydrogen, you're going to need to store some
*  green hydrogen there in storage tanks on site because you basically need kind of a backup
*  supply in case your main supply fails.
*  All of those things are going to add cost to hydrogen.
*  Not only are they going to ask us, we don't really know how to do them.
*  We have very few pipelines that are hydrogen ready.
*  All of that investment needs to happen as a result to make the green hydrogen economy
*  come alive.
*  Why it's so lavishly subsidized is to kind of fund all that downstream investment that's
*  eventually going to make the economy come true.
*  But I think you're absolutely right that this is something where we know it is physically
*  possible for many of these applications.
*  But it is not being done at scale.
*  And it's certainly not being done at the scale of a national economy.
*  So that's some of the question of innovation, right?
*  Getting the things that we don't yet know how to build and don't yet know how to finance
*  into the world.
*  But a lot of what has to happen here, including once some money is given out, is that things
*  we do know how to build get built.
*  They get built really fast and they get built at this crazy scale.
*  So I've been reading this paper on what they call the Green's Dilemma by J.B.
*  Ruhl and James Salzman, who also wrote this paper called Old Green Law's New Green Deal
*  or something like that.
*  And I think they get at the scale problem here really well.
*  They write, and they're working off of some Princeton numbers here.
*  The largest solar facility currently online in the US is capable of generating 585 megawatts
*  To meet even a middle road renewable energy scenario would require bringing online two
*  new 400 megawatt solar power facilities, each taking up at least 2000 acres of land every
*  week for the next 30 years.
*  And that's just solar.
*  We're not talking wind there.
*  We're not talking any of the other stuff we've discussed here, transmission lines.
*  Can we do that?
*  Do we have that capacity?
*  No, we do not.
*  We absolutely do not.
*  I think we're going to build a ton of wind and solar.
*  We do not right now have the system set up to use that much land to build that much new
*  solar and wind by the time that we need to build it.
*  I think it is partially because of permitting laws.
*  And I think it's also partially because right now there is no master plan.
*  There's no overarching strategic entity in the government that's saying, how do we get
*  from all these subsidies in the IRA to net zero?
*  What is our actual plan to get from where we are right now to where we're emitting
*  zero carbon as an economy?
*  And without that function, no project is essential.
*  No activity that we do absolutely needs to happen.
*  And so therefore everything just kind of proceeds along at a convenient pace.
*  So there are two places to go here.
*  I want to put a pin in permitting and come back to it and talk first about that question
*  of a plan.
*  So given the scale of what's being attempted here, you might think that's something the
*  IRA does is to have some entity in the government, as you're saying, say, okay, we need this
*  many solar farms.
*  This is where we think we should put them.
*  Let's find some people to build them or let's build them ourselves.
*  And as I understand what it actually does is there's an office somewhere waiting for
*  private companies to send in an application for a tax credit for solar that they say they're
*  going to build.
*  And then we hope they build it.
*  And I mean, we check up for the tax credit and things like that.
*  The point is not that they just get to walk away with the money, but that it's an almost
*  entirely passive process on the part of the government.
*  I entirely would be going too far because I do think they talk to people and they're
*  having conversations.
*  But in terms of the literal function of the law, the builder applies, not the government
*  plans.
*  Is that accurate?
*  That's correct.
*  Yes.
*  And you think that's bad?
*  You sound like you think that's bad.
*  I think here's what I would say.
*  And this gets back to like, what do we want the IRA to do?
*  And what are our expectations for the IRA?
*  The IRA exists to build out a ton of green capacity and shift the political economy of
*  the country toward being less dominated by fossil fuels and more dominated by the clean
*  energy industry, frankly, then it is working.
*  If the IRA is meant to get us all the way to net zero, then it is not capable of that.
*  Now what it is capable of is pairing what we could do for the power sector is to pair
*  EPA regulations that require utilities to do certain things with the IRA subsidies.
*  And then hopefully we get to a place where we have a fairly decarbonized power sector.
*  And I should be clear that I think we're going to build out a ton of wind and solar no matter
*  what.
*  The issue is that, and we've known this is a problem with IRA the whole time, and I think
*  to some degree, why I keep going back to this expectations question is it is like in 2022,
*  right, we had no way to see how we were going to reduce emissions.
*  We did not know if we were going to get a climate bill at all.
*  Now we have this really aggressive climate bill and we're like, oh, is this going to
*  get us to net zero?
*  But getting to net zero was like seen as a really was not even something kind of on the
*  possibility in 2022.
*  The issue is that the IRA requires ultimately private actors to come forward and do these
*  things and as more and more renewables get onto the grid, almost mechanically, there's
*  going to be less interest in bringing the final piece of like decarbonized electricity
*  infrastructure onto the grid as well.
*  Because the first things that get applied for are the ones that are more obviously profitable,
*  the ones that fill a bigger need.
*  Is that what you're saying that in a marginal way, that as this goes on, the things you
*  would need to do to go the final miles and less profitable, etc.
*  Exactly, exactly.
*  So I think when you and I look at the IRA, we see all these subsidies were like, this
*  is amazing, you're going to be able to make a ton of money doing these things building
*  wind, building solar, whatever.
*  And to be clear, most of the build out that's going to happen from the IRA hasn't happened
*  yet.
*  We have a long way to go.
*  I think a ton of build out is going to happen.
*  The issue is, when you talk to solar developers, they don't see it like, you know, am I going
*  to make a ton of money?
*  Yes or no.
*  They see it like they have a capital stack, and they have certain incentives and certain
*  ways to make money based off certain things they can do.
*  And as more and more solar gets on the grid, building solar at all becomes less profitable.
*  But also just generally like, there's less people willing to buy the solar, they have
*  less ways to make money.
*  And to some degree, solar developers are not really, they're competing for dollars against
*  any other thing you can do with your dollars.
*  And so as the law goes on, there is this risk.
*  And as we get closer to a zero carbon grid, there is this risk that basically less and
*  less gets built because it will become less and less profitable.
*  Let's call that the last 20% risk.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  The last 40%.
*  I mean, you can probably attach different numbers to that.
*  But let's talk about the first big trunch, right?
*  So you have solar developers, wind developers, everybody coming in to get these tax credits.
*  You do have a lot more applications happening now.
*  I mean, there has been a big boom in this industry.
*  When I hear people talk who are implementing the IRA, so John Podesta, who is a former
*  chief staff for Bill Clinton, a top advisor to Barack Obama, now he came out of retirement
*  to work with Joe Biden on an IRA implementation.
*  He gave an interview to Bill McKibben at the New Yorker.
*  And McKibben eventually says to him, well, what are you worried about here?
*  And the first thing he says is permitting.
*  And Podesta has become obsessed with permitting.
*  I've said a lot of us.
*  I've become more obsessed with permitting.
*  Gavin Newsom is having a permitting fight out in California.
*  So tell me about the permitting problem here.
*  Why is everybody suddenly so focused on permitting?
*  Permitting is the primary thing that is going to hold back any construction, basically,
*  especially out west, that we need to do to build green infrastructure.
*  Because right now permitting fights, the process under the National Environmental Policy Act,
*  just at the federal level, can take 4.5 years.
*  And now if we're trying to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030, as we claim we're going to
*  do under the Paris Agreement, let's say every single project we need to do was applied for
*  today, which is not true.
*  Those projects have not yet been applied for.
*  They would be approved under the current permitting schedule in 2027.
*  And that's before they get built, that process.
*  That's before they get built.
*  So then you have permission to build in 2028.
*  And then we're going to build all this green infrastructure between 2028 and 2030.
*  So I think everyone is obsessed with permitting because I think everyone has realized, partially
*  as a result of your work, that any kind of infrastructure, including whether we're talking
*  about highways, whether we're talking about solar farms, whether we're talking about large-scale
*  factories that requires any kind of federal input, any kind of federal authority, but
*  also many kinds of infrastructure that are happening at the state level where states
*  have their parallel permitting processes, it can take years to actually get them permitted.
*  And we don't have years to get emissions to zero to fight climate change.
*  Let me not be coy on this, because as you say, I've been covering this a lot.
*  And one of the things that has been an interesting dynamic to watch is, I would say the rhetoric
*  on permitting has moved at light speed, a kind of speed you almost never see in policy
*  in government, right?
*  Basically nobody on the left talked about permitting five years ago.
*  I don't want to say literally nobody, but it just, you weren't hearing it, including
*  in the climate discussion.
*  And now I just did a call about the Newsom permitting fight.
*  I mean, the stuff he's saying on the record is very, let's call it energetic, right?
*  Really mad at the environmental groups opposing him.
*  Podesta gave a speech about the White House's permitting principles that again was very
*  stark, right?
*  We have to fix this.
*  This is unacceptable.
*  And then you look at what everybody's proposing here and it's fairly modest.
*  It's, you know, let's try to constrain how long a National Environmental Policy Act review
*  takes.
*  Let's try to make it a little bit better to coordinate the process across the government.
*  Let's try to get California Environmental Quality Act litigation down to 270 days, that
*  kind of thing.
*  And it's not that these are bad, nor is it even that they're good.
*  It's just that on the one hand, people have moved to saying we do not have the laws, right?
*  The permitting laws, the procurement laws to do this at the speed we're promising and
*  we need to fix that.
*  And then what you're seeing them propose is kind of tweak oriented, I would say.
*  And these are tough issues.
*  I'm not saying that I have in my pocket, like the permitting plan, but it's a place where
*  it feels to me like the policy is still catching up right now to the sort of principles level
*  understanding that there's like a lag between like the severity of the problem people are
*  now seeing and what they have figured out and figured out the coalitions around to do
*  something about it.
*  That's like kind of my sense of the state of play.
*  But you've been covering this in many ways more closely than I have heard and certainly
*  more granularly.
*  Do you think that's right?
*  I think that there's two things happening.
*  First of all, you're right to see that there's a lag.
*  But I think there's two other dynamics at play here.
*  The first is that permitting reform is this phrase we all use because we know it takes
*  too long to get the government to give you permission to build things.
*  That's like the problem we've diagnosed.
*  And to say not just permission, but then there's all the litigation risk.
*  Exactly.
*  And let's talk about that in a second, because I think that is actually a key issue at play
*  here.
*  Permitting reform could mean a lot of different things.
*  And Democrats and Republicans have different ideas about what it could mean.
*  Within themselves have different ideas about what it could mean.
*  And one thing I want to hit this more directly in a second is that for many environmental
*  groups, the permitting process is their main tool.
*  It is how they do the good that they see themselves doing in the world.
*  They use the permitting process to slow down fossil fuel projects, to slow down projects
*  that they see as harming local communities or the local environment.
*  They use that exact litigation process.
*  And can you say what that is?
*  Like, give an example.
*  So what happens here?
*  So we talk about the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.
*  Let's just start calling it NEPA.
*  We talk about the NEPA process.
*  NEPA requires the government basically study any environmental impact from a project or
*  from a decision or from a big rule that could occur.
*  It produces hundreds of pages of study about any big highway, any big solar project, any
*  big piece of infrastructure, anything that is happening not just on federal land, but
*  in an area where the federal government specifically needs to grant authority, where the federal
*  government has jurisdiction.
*  That can mean in some cases factory farms that use federal loans.
*  That can mean large scale projects that might infringe on local water.
*  Any giant project in the United States goes through this NEPA process.
*  The federal government studies what the environmental impact of the project will be.
*  And it makes a decision about whether to approve the project.
*  That decision has nothing to do with the study.
*  Now notionally the study is supposed to inform the project.
*  And as part of the NEPA process, the federal government has to consider other possibilities,
*  other options for the project.
*  But the decision the federal government makes, the actual can you build this, yes or no,
*  legally has no connection to the study.
*  But it must conduct the study in order to make that decision.
*  Then any outside group can show up with people who say they're affected by the project and
*  say hey look, you've made this decision, but you didn't study this one impact of the project
*  well enough.
*  You didn't study the fact that it might impact or harm this bird population or that it might
*  disturb this particular wetland.
*  But any actor can show up and say hey, you didn't consider something in the study.
*  And the government has to pause what it's doing, whether it's approving the project,
*  whether construction has begun in some cases, go back, amend the study, add the thing that
*  the group has raised, and then kind of make the decision again.
*  It doesn't have to change the decision because of the study.
*  It just has to amend the decision.
*  This is the prime tool.
*  I think one reason that permitting reform is so tough for the Democratic coalition specifically
*  is that this process of forcing the government to amend its studies of the environmental
*  impact of various decisions is the main tool that environmental litigation groups like
*  Earthjustice use to slow down fossil fuel projects and use to slow down large scale
*  chemical or industrial projects that they don't think should happen.
*  And so when we talk about speeding up permitting and when we talk about making this program
*  And when we talk about making it more immune to litigation, they see it as we're going
*  to take away their main tools to fight fossil fuel infrastructure.
*  The issue is that anyone, not just environmental groups, not just Democratic-aligned coalition
*  members like Earthjustice, can bring one of these lawsuits.
*  And people do regularly against, say, big offshore wind projects, against solar projects,
*  against transmission projects.
*  And so what we're fighting about and why permitting is so uniquely divisive and also
*  hard and why there's this gap between rhetoric and what's actually being proposed is that
*  the same tool that is slowing down the green buildout is also what's slowing down the fossil
*  fuel buildout.
*  And for professional reasons, for earnest philosophical reasons, many, many climate activists, many
*  folks are very worried about anything that could kind of allow both to happen faster
*  because what they're worried about is like we're going to build out a ton of new fossil
*  fuel infrastructure.
*  I think that's part of what they're worried about.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, a lot of these groups, say the Audubon Society in different states has actually just
*  fought a lot of renewable energy infrastructure because wind turbines are often bad for birds.
*  I mean, that is...
*  There's a classic conflict here between the environmental movement classic, let's call
*  which was think globally, act locally, which said we're going to do everything we can to
*  preserve the local environment and what the environmental movement and the climate movement,
*  let's say, needs to do today, which is think globally, act with an eye to what we need
*  globally as well, which is in some cases, maybe welcome projects that may slightly reduce
*  local environmental quality or may seem to reduce local environmental quality in the
*  name of a decarbonized world because if we fill the atmosphere with carbon, like nobody's
*  going to get a good environment.
*  I was reading this piece by Michael Girard, who's Professor at Columbia Law School, he's
*  a founder of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law there.
*  It's called A Time for Triage and he has this sort of interesting argument that the environmental
*  movement in general, in his view, is engaged in something he calls trade-off denial.
*  And his whole point, and it's a very real point, and one reason I think permitting reform
*  is hard and one reason I say I don't have the solution in my pocket is that, look, you
*  can always come up with the edge cases that make the environmental movement look really
*  bad or make these laws look really bad.
*  So a famous one is in San Francisco, you ended up having like around a decade of fighting
*  and over a thousand pages of California Environmental Quality Act review to add bike lanes, just
*  like an obviously good thing for the environment.
*  It just takes forever.
*  But you do have things where you really are pitting interest against each other, including
*  environmental ones.
*  If we are going to build out two 2000 acre solar farms a week for 30 years, that is going
*  to take up land that did not have anything on it before.
*  It's plausible that we'll go into the habitats of endangered species or threatened species.
*  I mean, you really will have choices to make.
*  And his view and the view of some people is that, look, the climate crisis is so bad that
*  we just have to make those choices.
*  We have to do things we would not have wanted to do to preserve something like the climate
*  in which not just human civilization, but this sort of animal ecosystem has emerged.
*  But that's hard.
*  And who gets to decide which tradeoffs to make?
*  Like, that's the question, I think.
*  But this is a place where one reason I asked about the gap between rhetoric and policy
*  is that one thing I have not seen much of is this is the progressive permitting and
*  procurement.
*  This is the progressive build out plan, such that maybe the easiest concern here, which
*  is the concern where this will actually be used to add a bunch of fossil fuel infrastructure,
*  we have concocted a permitting speedway for projects that are named essential to climate
*  change.
*  And we have all kinds of examples in the past of how we have chosen projects to streamline.
*  I mean, there's like very famously based closing commissions.
*  And so one of the questions I have had is that permitting reform has been having these
*  weird like backdoor fights.
*  It's like it comes in as a Joe Manchin demand attached to clearance for this natural gas
*  pipeline he wants, or there's a bit of it in the debt deal where the Republicans want
*  some things, but you're not really seeing, like not really, I would say from the administration,
*  even though they have some principles now, not really from California, though Gavin Newsom
*  has like a set of sort of early things.
*  Like this is what we think we need to make the IRA happen on time.
*  And this is how we're going to decide what is a kind of project that gets this speedway
*  through whatever.
*  It's just been very modest, but modest also in a way that doesn't seem to me to be even
*  really trying to answer the environmentalist concerns.
*  Weirdly, it's been a coalitional fight, but not a coalitional process as best I can tell.
*  I think that's exactly right.
*  But I think there's kind of two things here.
*  The first is I think there's a failure on the part of, let's say, the environmental
*  coalition writ large to have the courage to have this conversation and to sit down at
*  a table and be like, OK, we know that certain projects aren't happening fast enough.
*  We know that we need to build out faster.
*  What could we actually do to the laws to be able to construct things faster and to meet
*  our net zero targets and to let the IRA kind of achieve what it could achieve?
*  So on the one hand, it's a failure of coalitional courage.
*  That's partially as a result of the fact that when we talk about permitting reform and we're
*  like, well, what's the progressive permitting reform?
*  You need to give us options here.
*  You need to tell us what you think we should change in order to make the IRA happen.
*  They see any conversation about permitting reform as taking away their main tool to slow
*  down fossil fuels.
*  Now, I will say that there's a few progressives in Congress, progressives in the Senate have
*  proposed some reforms here.
*  I was going to ask you about this because there is this bill, Promoting Efficient and
*  Engaged Reviews Act, which Tom Carper, Brian Schatz, Sheldon Whitehouse, who are all climate
*  oriented Democrats in the Senate have authored.
*  I was going to ask what you thought of it.
*  One thing you see in this law in that proposal and in other proposals from Democrats is to
*  basically speed up or to grant faster deadlines or accelerated review to projects that specifically
*  help fight climate change or adapt to climate change.
*  Part of the issue is that we're in this environment where Democrats control the Senate, Republicans
*  control the House, and it feels like very unlikely that you could just get, we are going
*  to accelerate projects, but only those that are good for climate change into the law,
*  given that Republicans control the House.
*  Part of the progressive fear here is that the right solutions must recognize climate
*  change.
*  There's probably no climate change.
*  Republicans are very skeptical that there are reforms that are neutral on the existence
*  of climate change and whether we need to build faster to meet those demands that can pass
*  through a Republican controlled House.
*  Well you did an interesting piece on the permitting reforms that almost without notice got made
*  as part of the debt ceiling deal and the political economy and what got traded away of that.
*  I actually felt that one of the implications of that piece was it was maybe a huge mistake
*  for progressives not to have figured out what they wanted here and could accept here back
*  when the negotiating partner was Joe Manchin.
*  I think that's absolutely right.
*  So can you walk through, so there's a Manchin sidecar process that fails.
*  Yes.
*  Then what happens in the debt ceiling deal and why are you arguing that Democrats ended
*  up trading some things away that maybe they shouldn't have because what comes next then
*  is going to put them much more against the wall.
*  So Manchin proposed a set of permitting reforms back in November and December.
*  And not just him.
*  Schumer has his stuff in there.
*  Exactly.
*  And this was basically a Schumer-Manchin bill we should say.
*  And environmentalists call it Manchin's dirty deal but let's be fair here that Schumer and
*  Biden's support for this bill was the price of Manchin's support of the IRA.
*  And then Biden and Schumer, maybe not as enthusiastically as everyone would like, but again they're
*  dealing with coalition problems from the Green Groups, do go and support Manchin's bill.
*  And basically Manchin's bill is a set of largely moderate reforms to the NEPA process that
*  we'll describe in a second because most of them eventually pass.
*  But it also includes a number of reforms to the process of building new electricity transmission,
*  which basically we need to make it easier to build transmission in order to fight climate
*  change.
*  Jesse Jenkins at Princeton relatively famously says 80% of the climate benefits of the IRA
*  will be lost if we don't 2X the amount of transmission we build per year.
*  See we're building all this new renewable energy generation.
*  If we don't build the lines to get all that new electricity to where it needs to be, that
*  electricity is meaningless.
*  I don't plug my car into a wind turbine.
*  Exactly.
*  And also solar relatively famously only works during the day, wind kind of works during
*  the evening hours when it's best.
*  If you build the transmission, you build a national grid that lets you like demand shift
*  as the sun moves across the country.
*  So peak electricity using hours are 5-8pm.
*  It's sunniest in the middle of the country when it's 5-8pm in the East Coast or it's
*  relatively sunny.
*  You can send electricity.
*  If you could send electricity from the plains or from the West to the East Coast, you actually
*  use much less acreage for solar, build much less solar overall while having the same kind
*  of zero carbon grid.
*  It's also much more efficient.
*  It's cheaper.
*  This bill is basically a set of moderate NEPA reforms and transmission reforms.
*  Democrats, progressives refuse to move on it.
*  Now, I do want to be fair here because I think Democrats absolutely should have seized on
*  that opportunity because it was the only moment when Democrats, we could tell already that
*  Democrats, I mean Democrats actually by that moment had lost the House.
*  And so their next negotiating partner by December 22, if they didn't accept Manchin as their
*  Senate Republicans as their negotiating partner, if they want to do anything on permitting,
*  it was going to be a bill that Republicans at least had more say in determining what
*  it would look like.
*  Now, I do want to be fair here that Manchin's own account of what happened with this bill
*  is that Senate Republicans killed it and that once McConnell failed to negotiate on the
*  bill in December, Manchin's bill was dead.
*  It died in both places.
*  It died in both places.
*  House progressives weren't going to support it and McConnell wasn't helping on it and
*  it didn't have the support at all.
*  I think that's right.
*  And Republicans already knew they were going to get the House too, so they had less kind
*  of incentive to play along.
*  Probably the time for this was October anyway.
*  But it wasn't like Democrats were trying to get the support.
*  No, no, no, no, no, especially not progressives.
*  The point is not that they're bad.
*  They were furious at Manchin for good reason by this point.
*  Yeah.
*  To your point about this was all coming down to the wire, Manchin could have let the IRA
*  pass many months before this and like they would have had more time to negotiate together,
*  right?
*  The fact that it was associated with Manchin in the way it was was also what made it toxic
*  to progressives who didn't want to be like held up by him anymore.
*  Yes.
*  And Manchin was also requiring as part of this bill basically immediate authorization
*  for the Mountain Valley pipeline, this natural gas pipeline.
*  And I think we should be clear too that while progressives were furious with Manchin over
*  a lot of things, this one natural gas pipeline was like the focus of their opposition to
*  the bill.
*  Quite ironic because then what happened is the house switched over.
*  We got the whole debt ceiling crisis.
*  What becomes kind of clear by the winter of this year, February, March of this year, is
*  that as Democrats and Republicans begin to talk through this debt ceiling process, where
*  again permitting was not the main focus, it was the federal budget, the entirely separate
*  political process basically.
*  I would say the core weirdness of the debt ceiling fight was there was no main focus
*  It wasn't like the ones where it was about the debt, like Republicans had some stuff
*  to cut spending.
*  They also wanted to cut spending on the IRS, which would increase the debt.
*  It was a total mishmash of stuff happening in there.
*  As that mishmash is progressing, I think Democrats start to look at what a deal might look like.
*  And they're like, well, we want to do permitting and Republicans want to do permitting.
*  And house progressives don't really want to seem to play ball here.
*  This is especially in the Senate.
*  So like, what would it look like to kind of get?
*  This is something that majorities in both parties would support, but would be very tricky
*  for any party to move by itself.
*  So what could we get out of this process?
*  Like both sides, and there's kind of off the record meetings, there's just like a slow
*  negotiation process where basically, as part of this debt ceiling deal, you might get some
*  NEPA reforms and you might get some transmission reforms.
*  That like alchemy goes into the final debt ceiling negotiations, which are between principal
*  in Congress and the White House.
*  And what we get is a set of basically the NEPA reforms in Joe Manchin's bill from last
*  year and the Mountain Valley Pipeline, the thing that environmentalists were focused
*  on blocking and effectively no transmission reforms.
*  Let's say the set of NEPA reforms that were just enacted that are now in the law include,
*  basically, the word reasonable has been inserted many times into NEPA.
*  So the law, instead of saying the government has to study all environmental impacts, now
*  it has to study reasonable environmental impacts, it also, and this is a kind of climate win,
*  has to study the environmental impacts that could result from not doing a project.
*  The kind of average NEPA environmental impact study today is 500 pages and takes 4.5 years
*  to produce.
*  Under the law, now the government is supposed to hit a page limit of 150 to 300 pages.
*  I think people think this is going to make things easier, but I'm a writer.
*  And it's not necessarily quicker to write shorter.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  And it also has to get the easiest NEPA reviews done in one year and the hardest NEPA reviews
*  done in two years.
*  And if the government agency hasn't made a decision in two years, then kind of the sponsor,
*  the applicant for the project, can sue the agency and get a court to give them a decision.
*  That's not as far as Republicans wanted.
*  Republicans actually wanted to make the law that if an agency went over the NEPA process,
*  that if it passed a deadline, that immediately the project would be approved irrevocably
*  and no court could review it.
*  What emerged was that now you can sue an agency and kind of get an accelerated result.
*  One I think reasonable critique you hear on this from Democrats or from the left or from
*  someone is that if you want to have all of these reviews happening and you want them
*  and we're rapidly expanding build out, then what you need is a lot more personnel.
*  And this doesn't do that.
*  This does not create a huge pot of money for the supply of people who are going to conduct
*  environmental impact reports to increase and to get even better recruitment into that sector
*  of the economy, right?
*  Like you're demanding faster, but you're not really increasing capacity that much.
*  Exactly.
*  If there were two progressive requirements for these negotiations, one was expanding
*  the number of staff that are working on this and making it more of a staffing issue.
*  And there's a study that's very well cited by progressives from three professors in Utah
*  who basically say, well, when you look at the National Forest Service and you look at
*  this 40,000 NEPA decisions, what mostly holds up these NEPA decisions is not like, oh, there's
*  too many requirements or like they had to study too many things that don't matter.
*  It's just there wasn't enough staff and that staffing is primarily the big impediment.
*  And so on the one hand, I think that's like probably accurate and that these are in some
*  cases the beast has been starved and these are very poorly staffed departments.
*  I think on the other hand, this did wind up being for progressives a way to get around
*  the conversation that we were just saying they're not having where the main progressive
*  demand was not like, where can we streamline NEPA?
*  What are we willing to accept here in the changes to the law?
*  The main progressive demand was just like, we must staff it better.
*  If you stare at this for too long, you will lose your mind, right?
*  Like, to the point of all this, I mean, I kind of, as you're suggesting, I don't really
*  like that study.
*  For instance, the most common form of NEPA report is not an environmental impact statement,
*  which is the one people kind of think up to the extent that they think of anything.
*  It's a categorical exclusion statement, which is to basically say, this is the kind of project
*  that does not need a NEPA review.
*  And that is partially a staffing problem.
*  But if it's taking you this much staffing and that much time to say something doesn't
*  apply to you, maybe you have a process problem.
*  Yes.
*  And you shouldn't just throw endless resources at a broken process, which brings me because
*  again, you can fall into this never get out, which brings me I think to the bigger critique
*  here.
*  This draft law paper I've been reading called the Greens Dilemma, by Ruel and Salzman.
*  And NEPA gets a lot of attention here in California.
*  Its cousin, the California Environmental Quality Act, gets a lot of attention.
*  But one of their points is that these bills are almost symbolic because there's so much
*  else happening.
*  And it's really the way all this interlocks and the number of possible choke points that
*  if you touch one of them or even you streamline one of them, it doesn't necessarily get you
*  that far.
*  Quote, all told over 60 federal permitting programs operate in the infrastructure approval
*  regime.
*  And that is just the federal system.
*  State and local approvals and impact assessments could also apply to any project.
*  So their view is that under this system, it's simply not possible to build the amount of
*  decarbonization infrastructure we need at the pace we need it.
*  That no amount of streamlining NEPA or streamlining in California CEQA will get you there.
*  We basically have been operating under what they call an environmental grand bargain dating
*  back to the 70s, where we built all of these processes to slow things down and to clean
*  up the air and clean up the water.
*  And we accepted this trade off of slower building, quite a bit slower building, for a cleaner
*  environment.
*  And that was a good trade.
*  It was addressing the problems of that era.
*  And now we have the problems of this era, which is we need to unbelievably rapidly build
*  out decarbonization infrastructure to keep the climate from warming more than we can
*  handle.
*  And that we just don't have a legal regime or anything like that.
*  You would need to do a whole new grand bargain for this era.
*  And I've not seen that many people say that, but it seems true to me.
*  I'm curious if you think they're right.
*  I think they are right.
*  And I think I would make two broad observations.
*  One aspect of the environmental grand bargain of the 70s that we don't talk about as much
*  or that I think fits into this is that it was actually part of a much larger set of
*  decisions that were happening in the 70s across the government and across American society
*  that we're dealing with the fact that American manufacturing was really no longer cost competitive.
*  The role that America had played in the global economy in the 50s and 60s, where we had a
*  ton of manufacturing, where we were kind of a factory to a world rebuilding from World
*  War II, was no longer tenable.
*  And then also we wanted to focus on more of these kind of high wage, what we would now
*  call knowledge economy jobs.
*  That was a large economic transition happening in the 70s and 80s.
*  And it dovetailed really nicely with the environmental grand bargain.
*  Today we're in a place where American policymakers and Americans generally in both parties are
*  not as sure that was the right choice.
*  And they're certainly not as sure that that is the right stance for the US to have if
*  we're facing this kind of decades long competition with China.
*  And that more broadly, like there were good parts of the economy that that moment built
*  and there were bad parts.
*  At some point, the IRA like recognizes that that environmental grand bargain is no longer
*  operative, right?
*  Because it says, we're going to build all this big physical fixed infrastructure in
*  the United States.
*  I'm a manufacturing giant again.
*  But like, there has not been a recognition among either party of what exactly that will
*  mean and what will be required to have it take hold.
*  And I want to give an example here about one particular technology, which is carbon capture.
*  And how we're seeing a grand bargain get hashed out.
*  But right now there's no one actor or no one party that can kind of be as serious about
*  this as it needs to be.
*  The Supreme Court has said it ruled last year that basically the EPA can't generation shift.
*  It can't require utilities to change the kind of fossil fuel they're burning or what they're
*  doing to meet climate change requirements under the Clean Air Act.
*  That if the EPA wants to treat carbon pollution as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act
*  and keep power plants from emitting it, it can't say, well, just shut down your coal
*  plants, shut down your natural gas plants and build a ton of renewables.
*  It must require a form of on the ground inside the fence line, like at the site of the power
*  plant, pollution control technology.
*  The only way to do that really is by requiring carbon capture and requiring the large construction
*  of major industrial infrastructure at many, many coal plants and natural gas plants around
*  the country in order to capture carbon so it doesn't enter the atmosphere until we don't
*  contribute to climate change.
*  That is what the Supreme Court has ruled.
*  Until that body changes, that is going to be the law.
*  So the EPA has now last month proposed a new rule under the Clean Air Act that is going
*  to require coal plants and some natural gas plants to install carbon capture technology
*  to do basically what the Supreme Court has all but kind of required the EPA to do.
*  I don't think that rule is strong enough.
*  I think it could be stronger.
*  We can get into that.
*  But the EPA has to demonstrate in order to kind of make this rule the law and in order
*  to make this rule pass muster with the Supreme Court that this is a tenable, that this is
*  the best available and technologically feasible option.
*  And that means you actually have to allow carbon capture facilities to get built.
*  And you have to create a legal process that will allow carbon capture facilities to get
*  built.
*  And that means you need to be able to tell a power plant operator that if they capture
*  carbon, there's a way they can inject it back into the ground, the thing that they're supposed
*  to do with it.
*  Well, EPA simultaneously has only approved the kind of well that you need to inject carbon
*  that you've captured from a coal plant or natural gas plant back into the ground.
*  It's called a Class 6 well.
*  The EPA has only ever approved two Class 6 wells.
*  It takes years for the EPA to approve a Class 6 well.
*  And that is environmental justice groups really, really oppose these Class 6 wells because
*  they see any carbon capture as an effort to extend the life of the fossil fuel infrastructure.
*  And in fact, in Louisiana, you see many environmental groups, including Earth Justice, opposing
*  an effort by the Democratic governor of Louisiana to expedite Class 6 well approval while holding
*  what Class 6 well are actually required to do to a higher standard than the EPA itself
*  would require.
*  The issue here is that it seems like CCS, carbon capture, is going to be essential to
*  how the U.S. decarbonizes.
*  Legally, we have no other choice because of the constraints the Supreme Court has placed
*  on the EPA.
*  At the same time, environmental justice groups and big green groups to some extent oppose
*  building out any CCS.
*  And so on the one hand, there's a technology we must build in order to decarbonize.
*  On the other hand, no of the actually existing environmental groups want to see that technology
*  get approved.
*  And they're fighting any effort, whether open or kind of sub-roads, they're fighting any
*  effort to streamline and make it possible to build Class 2 wells, to build CCS.
*  There's a deep logical disconnect there between...
*  Well, it's not a logical disconnect because they would say, to be fair to them, right?
*  They would say there are other ways to decarbonize.
*  That may not be the way we've chosen because the politics weren't there for it.
*  But there are a lot of these groups that believe you could have a 100% renewables, do not use
*  all that much carbon capture, right?
*  They would have liked to see a different decarbonization path taken too.
*  I'm not sure that path is realistic.
*  I think that's right.
*  But I also want to say...
*  But that is what you hear.
*  In some ways, I also want to differentiate here between, let's say, an effort to block
*  any one individual CCS project and an effort to stop the entire apparatus of approving
*  and constructing CCS projects across the country.
*  Because an effort to stop any one CCS project, to some degree, that might be part of a new
*  grand bargain where basically we say, you can do CCS, but it's really hard to get a
*  project approved.
*  That's a little different from saying...
*  From what the EPA will need to do legally in order to finally pass muster and get Clean
*  Air Act rules passed to Supreme Court, which is say it is possible to build a CCS project
*  anywhere in the country.
*  So what you do, sir, are environmental groups opposing kind of making it possible to build
*  CCS anywhere in the country at all?
*  Right.
*  I'm not arguing that.
*  No, you're totally.
*  The only point I'm making here is I think this is where you see a compromise a lot of
*  them didn't want to make.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is a decarbonization strategy that actually does extend the life cycle of a lot of fossil
*  fuel infrastructure using carbon capture.
*  And because they never bought onto it, they're still using the pathway they have to try to
*  block it.
*  The problem is that's part of the path that's now been chosen.
*  So if you block it, we just don't decarbonize.
*  It's not like you get the 100% renewable strategy.
*  Exactly.
*  The bargain that will emerge from that set of actions and that set of coalitional tradeoffs
*  is we will simply keep running this and we will not cap it.
*  And I want to be also clear here that I understand where they are.
*  I understand why these demands of these groups are what they are.
*  Let's be really clear.
*  If there was a petrochemical refinery in the middle of Washington, D.C., I don't think
*  there'd be a lot of national support for keeping a lot of petrochemical refineries open.
*  Right.
*  And I don't think I would be very enthusiastic about the idea.
*  That being said, the rhetoric you sometimes see from these groups is that CCS is a false
*  solution that will not actually fight climate change.
*  That is preventing the environmental movement from calling industries bluff here because
*  industry says, oh, we need CCS to decarbonize.
*  What could be possible is that progressives and Democrats and EPA turns around and says,
*  oh, that's fine.
*  You can do CCS.
*  You just have to cap every single stationary source in the country.
*  Like you want to do CCS?
*  We totally agree.
*  Essential.
*  You must put CCS infrastructure on every power plant, on every factory that burns fossil
*  fuels, on everything.
*  If progressives were to do that and were to get into the law, and there's nothing this
*  Supreme Court has said, by the way, that would limit progressives from doing that, the upshot
*  would be we shut down a ton more stationary sources and a ton more petrochemical refineries
*  and these bad facilities that groups don't want than we would under the current plan.
*  But because it is coalitionally uncomfortable to turn around and say, oh, sure, you want
*  You can do CCS.
*  You just have to put it on everything.
*  What is effectively going to happen is that way more factories and power plants stay open
*  and uncapped than would be otherwise.
*  So for obvious coalitional reasons, the dynamics we are talking about here at the state level
*  are stronger in blue states where you have strong environmental movements that then interact
*  with democratic governments.
*  I mean, even the example you gave of Louisiana, you do at least have a democratic governor
*  there.
*  One reason Louisiana is so important is because Texas will probably also apply for this process.
*  And because Texas has a Republican administration right now, that process will probably be easier
*  and more lax than Louisiana would be.
*  So something really interesting is emerging with where the money is going.
*  So Republican controlled states are just on track to get a lot more of it.
*  So the Rocky Mountain Institute estimates that red states will get $623 billion in investments
*  by 2030 compared to $354 billion for blue states.
*  Governor Gavin Newsom in an interview with me recently was complaining about how he's
*  saying the word he used was indignant.
*  He's like, I'm indignant to see these red states that have fought these policies every
*  step of the way getting this money.
*  So I know there are a number of reasons here, and I want to get into some of the red state
*  politics here, but just at the high level, why are red states getting so much more of
*  this money?
*  I think there's two reasons.
*  I think first of all, red states have been more enthusiastic about getting the money.
*  They're the ones giving away the tax credits.
*  They have a business friendly environment.
*  And ultimately, the way many, many of these red state governors see it is that these are
*  just businesses.
*  And yeah, they may be doing something that at the national level, we don't think we should
*  be subsidizing, but we're happy to help you come to our state and contribute to our state's
*  business environment.
*  When you say about giving away the money, what do you mean?
*  It's the federal government who gives away the money.
*  In some cases, there is local tax benefits or just local incentives, you know, right
*  get discounts basically on your local business tax, local property taxes if you come in as
*  a large industrial producer.
*  I think the other thing is that these states, many of them are right to work states.
*  And so they might pay their workers less.
*  They certainly face much less risk financially from a unionization campaign in their state.
*  And so frankly, one reason that red states are getting a lot of this money to support
*  the new construction of heavy industry and manufacturing is that regardless of the IRA,
*  that's where manufacturing and industrial investment goes in the first place.
*  And that's where it's been going for 20 years because of the set of business friendly and
*  local subsidies and right to work policies.
*  So the private companies that are applying for this money like to locate in the red states.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  Because the climate for them is simpler.
*  And there were a lot of provisions in the bill that were trying to have higher labor
*  standards that were to the extent that a right to work state is an advantage in this.
*  I mean, you can make the argument from, again, triaging tradeoffs to get decarbonization,
*  but that's not the argument this bill made.
*  That is not what the Biden administration wanted.
*  Biden brags about being the most pro-union president in American history.
*  So are those labor standards that they thought were going to be so potent where you get more
*  money in credits for better jobs?
*  Are those not proving effective?
*  I think there's two things going on here.
*  And I think to some degree, the law is actually a little undecided.
*  If we can ascribe intentionality to the law, I think the law is a little undecided.
*  You created a large language model trained off of the IRA and had it answer questions
*  for you.
*  On the one hand, I think the administration wants to see as many of these be union jobs
*  as possible.
*  And what it's been able to do in the IRA is like require the construction jobs for these
*  factories to be unionized or to be effectively unionized to receive union wages.
*  It can't always require that the workers who then work in the factories are actually
*  part of unions.
*  That's one thing.
*  I think the administration would say, yeah, we want this to be a big union led effort.
*  We want it to go to the Great Lakes states that are our political firewall.
*  At the same time, I think the other thing happening here, and I think the other thing
*  that to some degree the people who shaped the law knew what happened is that a ton of
*  this investment would go to red states.
*  And it would go to red states because that's where private industry has been locating since
*  the 70s and 80s.
*  And it would go to the southeast, right?
*  And the sun belt.
*  And that that wouldn't be so bad because then you would get a dynamic where red state senators,
*  red state representatives, red state governors would want to support the transition further
*  and would certainly not support the repeal of the IRA provisions and the repeal of climate
*  provisions.
*  And that you get this kind of nice vortex of like the investment goes to red states,
*  red states feel less antagonistic toward climate policies, more investment goes to red states.
*  Red state governors may even begin to support environmental regulation because that basically
*  locks in benefits and advantages to the companies located in their states already.
*  And so I think to some degree, there was a little bit of hazy thinking about what exactly
*  was going to happen here, because on the one hand, I think there was a hope that these
*  would be unionized jobs.
*  And on the other hand, I think anyone looking at the landscape of where large scale corporate
*  investment was going in the 2000s and 2010s would see that it was going to go to Georgia
*  and see that it was going to go to red states and hoped that by making clean investment
*  there that you might dislodge some of the Republican opposition to climate policies.
*  So red states can sound like one class of thing, but they're not on this.
*  So you mentioned Georgia.
*  Georgia has been getting a lot of investment here and Kemp, the Republican governor of
*  Georgia has been very excited about it, has talked it up.
*  They're really open for IRA business.
*  And then we mentioned Texas.
*  And in Texas, there's been a raft of laws proposed, some of them passing, some of them
*  that are basically making renewable energy harder to build in Texas that are trying to
*  make Texas more of an oil and gas state.
*  You've seen the governor of Texas after there were huge blackouts because the gas system
*  failed, blaming renewables for this somehow and trying to make it easier to build natural
*  gas infrastructure.
*  So I think one of the possible failure modes here is that instead of the red states actually
*  getting a lot of investment, they turn against it as well capital or government ESG or something
*  and begin to make it hard to do in the way they basically wall themselves off from the
*  Medicaid money in Obamacare.
*  How do you see that playing out?
*  It's worth kind of splitting this into two different categories.
*  On the one hand, what you see in Texas is yes, this kind of anti ESG backlash, maybe
*  that's now going away.
*  This rejection of kind of making decisions in the market based on anything other than
*  hard, what are supposedly the hardest of market fundamentals.
*  You also see rejection of renewables and a rejection of clean electricity generation.
*  I would kind of divide clean electricity generation renewables from EVs.
*  I guess what I'd say generally is what you see is that EV investment is generally welcomed
*  by Georgia, by Tennessee, by Kentucky, by Texas.
*  I mean, Elon Musk lives in Texas now.
*  Exactly.
*  So I think what you see is that Republicans are increasingly warming to EV investment
*  and it's actually building out renewables and actually building out clean electricity
*  generation where you see them fighting harder.
*  And how much is the permitting differences mattered here?
*  Because I mean, this is an argument Newsom is making in California for his permitting
*  reforms which are fairly modest, but there's still a big fight there.
*  They point to Jennifer Granholm, the secretary of energy, giving this speech in California
*  where she's basically asked, how can California get more of this money?
*  Why isn't getting more of this money?
*  And she says, look, these other states are coming to me and saying we did permitting
*  reform like we have made it easier to build in such and such state.
*  She's like, if California can make it easier to build here, she's like, I can't tell you
*  where the money will go.
*  We're agnostic.
*  But that would definitely be helpful in getting manufacturing to relocate here and this money
*  would flow towards the manufacturing.
*  I think permitting is really important in two ways.
*  I think first of all, it's important in the approval of the factories themselves and the
*  approval of the infrastructure itself and simply easier to build in states.
*  In many states, you have to deal with the NEPA process.
*  In California, you have to deal with NEPA and this EQA process, right?
*  Like the basically a parallel state level NEPA process.
*  The other way that permitting matters, and this gets into the broader reason why private
*  investment was generally going to red states and generally going to the Sun Belt is that
*  the Sun Belt states, Georgia, Texas, it's easier to be there as a company because housing
*  costs are lower and because the cost of living is lower in those states.
*  And why is the cost of living lower in those states?
*  Because they're surrounded by big sprawl.
*  The cities are surrounded by big suburban sprawl where it's very cheap to build and
*  it's very cheap to live as someone who might work at those factories.
*  And so the big story in the American economy for the past 50 years or something, 40 years,
*  has been the growth of the Sun Belt and the relocation of people in the north or the south.
*  That's partially because of local permitting laws and there are cities you can point to
*  in the Sun Belt that have better permitting, but it's also partially because the Sun Belt
*  and the southeast, it was like the last part of the country to develop, frankly, and there's
*  just a ton more land around all the cities.
*  And so you can get away with the kind of sprawly suburban growth model in those cities.
*  There's still like, I don't know, alpha there.
*  It's just cheaper to kind of keep building suburbs there.
*  There's one other area before we wrap up of problem emerging, I think, that I want to
*  talk about, which is basically the supply chain for all of this.
*  We have become much more antagonistic, ambivalent towards China.
*  China has a lot of the supply chain for renewable energy, for batteries, etc.
*  They've got a lot of lithium and cobalt and so on, and they've bought up a lot of the
*  supply chain in other places for that.
*  And when I say the supply chain here, I actually primarily am talking about the actual mining
*  and manufacturing of these materials.
*  If we want to make all these EVs, if we want to make all these solar panels, we need a
*  lot of basically resource extraction from the earth.
*  Solar panels need chemicals to function.
*  And when you say, look, this environmental group is fighting this solar array, people
*  are like, oh, environmental groups, you know.
*  But when you say they're fighting a giant lithium extraction site, I mean, people don't
*  want to live near a lithium extraction site.
*  And we're going to need a lot of lithium extraction sites.
*  And there are ways in which this whole new clean energy world, not all of it is clean.
*  And not all of it is like gentle, peaceful, decentralized, right?
*  It's not all the small earth model.
*  We can't fight climate change.
*  We can't decarbonize.
*  We can't reach net zero with everyone having rooftop solar.
*  So how are you seeing the fights over these rare earth metals and the effort to build
*  a safe and if not domestic kind of friend shored supply chain there?
*  Let's talk kind of three different aspects of this.
*  The first is what is the process like to actually build new mines in the United States?
*  Are we going to be able to source some of these minerals from the U.S.?
*  That process seems to be proceeding, but going slowly.
*  There are some minerals we're not going to be able to get from the United States at all
*  and are going to have to get from our allies and partners across the world.
*  The kind of open question there is what exactly is the bargain we're going to strike with
*  countries that have these critical minerals and will it be fair to those countries?
*  Because if we were to turn around to Chile, say, which has a huge amount of usable lithium
*  reserves and say, well, we're going to take all your lithium.
*  We're going to help you mine your lithium.
*  Then because we have all these nice subsidies at home, we're going to take it into the United
*  States, refine it, turn it into high end products and then sell them back to you.
*  That is actually colonialism.
*  I think a word that's thrown around a lot, but saying we're going to take your raw resources,
*  add all the value to them and then force you to buy them back.
*  That is not an equitable way of relating to other countries.
*  That isn't to say that I think the IRA on net is going to be bad for other countries.
*  I just think we haven't really figured out what deal and even what mechanisms we can
*  use across the government to strike deals with other countries to mine the minerals
*  in those countries while being fair and just and creating the kind of economic arrangement
*  that those countries want.
*  Those countries will be able to turn around now and go to China and say, well, the US
*  is giving us this.
*  What would you give us, China?
*  To some degree, the Chinese are much far ahead of Americans on even being able to use policy
*  to adjust how countries make decisions.
*  A great example, Indonesia has these amazing nickel reserves.
*  Indonesia basically got Chinese companies to establish joint ventures in Indonesia so
*  it could learn how to take nickel that was coming out of the ground in Indonesia and
*  convert it into battery grade nickel.
*  That was not something Indonesia previously knew how to do.
*  Now it is learning that technology from Chinese companies and working jointly with them.
*  The last part to answer your question is, well, let's say we get the minerals.
*  Let's say we learn how to refine them.
*  There's many parts of the battery and many parts of EVs and many like subcomponents in
*  these green systems that there's not a strong incentive to produce in the US.
*  For instance, there's been $50 billion of investment in the EV and battery supply chain
*  in the US since the IRA passed.
*  We're definitely going to be doing final assembly of batteries in the US.
*  That's pretty clear.
*  We might be doing some refining.
*  There's all these middle components in batteries like the cathode and the anode.
*  One possibility here is that we wind up importing a ton of cathodes and anodes from China, putting
*  them into US made batteries, putting them into batteries with like 60% domestic content
*  and then selling them and repackaging them as US lithium ion batteries.
*  We'll be doing a lot of production in the US.
*  We'll feel like we have this great EV supply chain, but at certain core points of the supply
*  chain, not very high value points, let's be clear, but like certain core points, we won't
*  actually have this like dual supply chain from China.
*  I think at the same time, there's a ton of technology.
*  One answer to that might be to say, okay, well, what the federal government should do
*  is just like make it illegal for any of these battery makers or any of these EV companies
*  to work with Chinese companies.
*  So then we'll definitely establish this parallel supply chain.
*  We'll learn how to make cathodes and anodes.
*  We'll figure it out.
*  The issue is that there's technology on the frontier that like only Chinese companies
*  have and US automakers need to work with those companies in order to be able to compete with
*  them eventually.
*  How much easier would it be to achieve the IRA's goals if America's relationship with
*  China was more like its relationship with Germany?
*  It would be significantly easier.
*  And I think we view this entire challenge very differently because China, as you said,
*  not only is a leader in renewable energy, it actually made a lot of the important technological
*  gains over the past 15 years to reducing the cost of solar and wind.
*  It really did play a huge role on the supply side of reducing the cost of these technologies.
*  If we could approach that, if China were like Germany, if China were like Japan, and we
*  could say, oh, this is great.
*  China's just going to make all these things.
*  Our friend China is just going to make all these technologies and we're going to import
*  them.
*  They're going to be very cheap.
*  China is the source of this, basically the world's cheapest labor that can meet global
*  production standards.
*  This is awesome.
*  We're going to import it.
*  It would be much, much, much easier.
*  I think there would still probably be some need to diversify the global supply chain
*  I think right now, just whatever you think our relationship with China should be, China
*  makes a huge amount of solar.
*  It makes basically more than 75% of the world's solar panels.
*  It makes the further you go upstream in the solar supply chain, the more it dominates.
*  It refines 75% of the polysilicon that you need for solar.
*  But it actually, the machines that do the refining, 99% of them are made in China.
*  I think it would be reckless for the US to kind of rely on a single country and for the
*  world to rely on a single country to produce the technologies that we need for decarbonization
*  and unwise, regardless of our relationship with that country.
*  We want to geographically diversify the supply chain more.
*  But it would be significantly easier if we did not have to also factor into this, the
*  possibility that the US is going to need to have an entirely separate supply chain to
*  make use of for EVs, solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, potentially in the near term future.
*  I think that is a good place to end.
*  It seems like it's going to be hard to do all this.
*  Yes, I think it will be.
*  Luckily, I should add, this is exactly the kind of challenge that we're covering at
*  heatmap.news and folks should read our journalism there.
*  They should and in addition to that, what are three other books they should read?
*  Well, heatmap isn't a book.
*  Oh yeah, heatmap is not a book.
*  The first book is called The Ends of the World by Peter Brannon.
*  It's a book that's a history of mass extinctions, the Earth's five mass extinctions and actually
*  why he doesn't think we're currently in a mass extinction or why at least things would
*  need to go just as bad as they are right now for thousands and thousands of years for us
*  to be in basically the sixth extinction.
*  The book's amazing for two reasons.
*  The first is that it is the first that really got me to understand deep time.
*  You go to natural history museums, you see dioramas of what the carboniferous used to
*  look like.
*  Peter's book actually stitches it into a narrative that you can remember and that these are not
*  just different eras that you see at the museum and you have no idea how they fit together.
*  He explains how they one kind of trigger the next one.
*  Which is also an amazing book for understanding the centrality of carbon to Earth's geological
*  history going as far back as basically we can track.
*  The second book might be a little outdated now, but it's called Climate Shock by Renat
*  Wagner and Marty Weitzman.
*  It's about the economics of climate change and it's by, I would just say, probably my
*  favorite economist.
*  One of the co-authors is my favorite economist of climate change, Marty Weitzman, who has
*  become, I think until recently, was kind of the also ran important economist of climate
*  change.
*  Nordhaus was the famous economist.
*  He was the one who got all attention.
*  He's the one who won the Nobel.
*  Weitzman's way of thinking about climate change is a little different from Nordhaus's.
*  He focuses on risk and that climate change is specifically bad because it will damage
*  the environment, because it will make our lives worse.
*  But it's really specifically bad because we don't know how bad it will be.
*  It imposes all these huge high-end tail risks.
*  That blocking those tail risks is actually the main thing we want to do with climate
*  policy.
*  That is kind of, I think in some ways, what has become the US approach to climate change.
*  To some degree, it is like the underlying economic thinking that drives even the IRA,
*  where we want to just cut off these high-end mega warming scenarios.
*  This is a fantastic explanation of that particular way of thinking and of how to apply that way
*  of thinking to climate change and also to geoengineering.
*  The third book, a little controversial, is called Shorting the Grid by Meredith Angwin,
*  who's an engineer in Vermont.
*  It's going to be a little controversial because if you actually go look at her online presence,
*  she can be quite harsh toward renewables.
*  She's not the world's biggest renewable fan, but she is also not the world's biggest fan
*  of natural gas.
*  Her argument basically is that, first of all, if you are curious at all about electricity
*  markets and the actual policy that we have around electricity, which is an extremely
*  cursed area of American law and policy and also absolutely essential to ultimately decarbonizing,
*  the first half of the book is the best explanation of how electricity markets actually work and
*  the thinking behind them in such plain language.
*  It is incredibly impressive to me with the plain language she uses to describe them.
*  It's like a form of writing that feels like it went extinct in the 1970s.
*  But her argument is basically that electricity markets are not the right structure to organize
*  our electricity system.
*  Because we have chosen markets as a structured, organized electricity system in many states,
*  we're giving preferential treatment to natural gas and renewables to fuels that I think climate
*  activists may feel very different ways about.
*  Instead of coal, which she does think we should phase out, and really nuclear, that basically
*  we've made it easy for generators, for power plants that can accept side payments, that
*  can accept money from other places, such as by taking renewable electricity credits, by
*  taking capacity, just various other payments that exist in the electricity markets, by
*  making it easy for renewables and natural gas to kind of accept these side payments,
*  that we've made them much more profitable and therefore encourage people to build more
*  of them and therefore under-invested in the forms of generation such as nuclear that actually
*  make most of their money by selling electrons to the grid where they go to people's homes.
*  It's a really, really interesting book and I think a perspective that if you're immersed
*  in climate policy, you wouldn't necessarily have.
*  I don't endorse everything that she says, but I think if you want to understand electricity
*  and also if you want to understand this completely heterodox criticism of how we've structured
*  electricity in the United States and what we might need to do to decarbonize, I recommend
*  it.
