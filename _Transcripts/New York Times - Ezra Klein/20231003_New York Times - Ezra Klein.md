# Meet the ‘Angry, Aggrieved’ New Right
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [October 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVdMczqTCoM)
*  From New York Times Opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  Hey, it is Ezra. I am on book leave, but our guest this week is my colleague, the Times
*  Opinion columnist David French, whose work I have learned a ton from and whose just way
*  of comporting himself in public life I've often quite admired. He began his career as
*  a lawyer. He has deployed with the U.S. military. He's the author of many books, including Divided
*  We Fall, America's Secession Threat and How to Restore Our Nation. And I'm excited to
*  see what he does here behind the mic. I hope you enjoy it too.
*  One more thing today. So I am doing the annual Jefferson Memorial Lecture for UC Berkeley,
*  which I'm excited about as a kid who grew up in California, idolizing and then getting
*  repeatedly rejected by UC Berkeley when I applied there. And it's going to be the first
*  time I try to work through the ideas of the book in public with an audience in conversation
*  with someone else who knows what they're talking about on these issues, Amy Lerman in this
*  case. And if you'd like to join and hear what I've been thinking about, you can. Tickets
*  are available at calperformances.org. We'll put the link to the event page in show notes.
*  Again, that is October 5th at UC Berkeley.
*  At first glance, the U.S. Senator J.D. Vance, Catholic integralists and bigoted right-wing
*  influencers might not be so obviously connected, but they've all been associated with the
*  new right, an umbrella term for a range of subcultures and schools of thought that are
*  generally critical of traditional conservatism and embrace illiberalism. Today, I want to
*  help you understand the new right, both the ideological movement emerging in the conservative
*  establishment and the fringier, extremely online subculture of edge-lording that seems
*  to loom over it. I've called the men who occupy the space, and yes, it's mostly men, the lost
*  boys of the American right. They've made headlines for openly flirting with white supremacy,
*  anti-Semitism, ethno-nationalism, and nakedly authoritarian politics. And to me, they represent
*  one of the strangest and most troubling aspects of contemporary politics. Why are these voices
*  emerging? What is their worldview? How dangerous are they? To help answer these questions,
*  I've turned to Stephanie Slade, a senior editor at Reason. I can't think of anyone who has
*  done more original reporting on the new right than Stephanie. She's been to their conferences,
*  she's read their books, and she knows their culture. Stephanie is going to be our guide
*  into a dark world. As always, the show's email is Ezra Klein show at NY times.com.
*  Stephanie welcome to the Ezra Klein show.
*  Thank you so much for having me on.
*  So Stephanie, we're here to talk about the new right, not just to talk about the new
*  right ideologically, but also to talk about the new right culturally and why it matters.
*  How Stephanie, would you define what the new right is? And let's just start ideologically.
*  Ideologically, what is the new right?
*  You know, in American politics, we have a tendency to mostly first and foremost think
*  about the left versus right distinction. But what we're talking about when we talk about
*  the new right is a sort of different axis, AXIS, which would be the liberal versus illiberal.
*  Distinction. And of course it runs across both the left and the right. You could have
*  four quadrants. And on the right, you can have a sort of liberal, conservative, or liberal
*  right, which strikes some people as an oxymoron. But it's not. It's classical liberalism is
*  sort of what you think of when you think of Reagan, Skye, old school, fusionist, conservatism,
*  you know, a commitment to limited government and individual rights and rule of law. And
*  then there's this schism that's opened up. I call it the liberalism schism. And on the
*  far side, you have the illiberal right. And these are folks who kind of think that that
*  stuff is pretty outdated or maybe ideologically and philosophically wrong and always was.
*  And so they reject the idea of limited government and individual liberty to a greater or lesser
*  extent. And part of this as well is that the distinction here is that on the sort of classically
*  liberal side, there's a pretty strong continuing commitment to what might be considered like
*  the Martin Luther King Jr. approach to race relations, which says what should matter is
*  the content of your character, not the color of your skin. But on the far side of that
*  divide, there is more willingness to say, no, in fact, identity groups matter, identity
*  matter, ethnicity matters, and maybe in some cases to flirt with the idea that certain
*  races or identity subgroups are superior to others or that we should care about the purity
*  or lack thereof of our society. That stuff is happening on the far side of that schism.
*  And the new right would be made up of a whole bunch of different sort of factions and different
*  groups and individuals and currents. And they're not all synonymous with each other.
*  And they don't even always all play nicely with each other. So I think of the new right
*  as an umbrella term that contains a whole bunch of different. I mean, they are legion,
*  as you might say.
*  So who would be the politicians? Again, let's talk sort of ideology. Who would be the politicians
*  of the new right? The people, if they're going to look and they're going to say, okay, these
*  are the people perfectly or imperfectly who best embody what we're trying to do in the
*  body politic.
*  I think there are three members of the U.S. Senate who fall into this category. First
*  and foremost would be J.D. Vance, brand new senator in his first term, who ran explicitly
*  to be a part of the vanguard in the face of the new right. And he says things like my
*  voters hate the right people. And there is no longer a distinction between the public
*  sector and the private sector in America. I mean, it's very militant and it's pretty
*  radical. It's quite populist. And he's very explicit about this. He wanted to be the face
*  of the new right. I think Josh Hawley is another one. And, you know, we all remember the famous
*  image of him raising his fist on January 6th before the actual insurrection activities
*  began. But he cares a lot less about things like individual liberty and free markets than
*  old school Reaganite conservatives would. And then another person who's kind of gone
*  on a journey would be Marco Rubio, who I think started definitely as much more of a Reaganite
*  fusionist, old school, classically liberal conservative, but has adopted what he calls
*  common good conservatism. And this is definitely part of the lingo of the new right, which
*  is freedom is not enough. Individual liberty, free markets are not enough. We need, again,
*  muscular government that's willing to pursue our goals as conservatives, including potentially
*  through interventions into the marketplace that conservatives in the past have been skeptical
*  of. And in some cases in the social sphere, a willingness to use the power of the state
*  to sort of impose virtue on people or forcibly reorient society to the common good as they
*  understand it. And then in the presidential race, probably the paradigmatic example of
*  the new right would be Ron DeSantis. Yeah, Ron DeSantis is interesting because he is
*  a hybrid of the two. And in many ways, he came up as very much a free market guy, right?
*  A limited government guy. But in the last few years, he has absolutely adopted the rhetoric
*  of the culture warrior. He's clearly responding to the influence of the new right. And again,
*  when it comes, if you're thinking about what is a paradigmatic example of willing to use
*  state power to prosecute the culture war, to reward our friends and punish our enemies,
*  as they might say, DeSantis going after Disney would be the perfect example.
*  Right. So DeSantis, Disney, all Disney did was essentially raise its voice in opposition
*  to Florida state laws that were restricting education on sexual orientation and gender
*  identity in K through 12 schools. Disney objects to that. And then Ron DeSantis takes strong
*  and decisive action against Disney, eliminating an improvement district, a state entity that
*  had been built around sort of the Disney property, then replacing it with a new state entity
*  who then take action against Disney on the basis of trying to essentially punish Disney
*  for its more progressive ideas. Would you say that of the sort of the political
*  figures DeSantis has been most successful at actually translating the new right vision
*  into actual policy as compared to a JD Vance or Josh Hawley or a Marco Rubio who really
*  don't have policy wins to point to, but DeSantis actually has concrete policies that look like
*  what the new right wants. Yeah, that's a fair to say it's easier to do
*  when you're the governor of a state, you have more leeway to implement your will. And in
*  the past, that's just not been a thing that most Republican governors have said they wanted
*  to do or an agenda that they have pursued of again, exercising their will and imposing
*  their will on their state. But that is something that DeSantis has been very clear that he
*  sees no problem with. And I think in the Disney case, to be clear, this is problematic from
*  a classically liberal perspective for two reasons, sort of in two dimensions. One is
*  that it's an intervention in the marketplace. It's saying the state should be able to tell
*  businesses how they're run, what views they're allowed to express, and so on and so forth.
*  So it's a challenge to the, again, the old fashioned idea that Republicans are pro free
*  market or pro business even. But I think the much more disturbing part of this, and of
*  course, you've done amazing work elucidating why this is, is that it's a challenge or a
*  violation of the rule of law by using the power of the state to enact retribution against
*  a private entity, whether an individual person or private business or whatever it may be,
*  the government uses power to punish somebody retributively for their political speech.
*  That is a true violation of the rule of law as far as I'm concerned.
*  So I'm going to read something that you wrote, or actually a read a quote that you quoted
*  in a piece that you wrote. And this is when in 2022, you went to NatCon 3, the sort of
*  the convention for national conservatives. And there was a speech, a segment that you
*  highlighted. Here's the key language.
*  The institutional left does not intend to leave anything of the old republic behind
*  for us to salvage. Constitutionalism, scientific inquiry, individual liberty, civil society,
*  volunteerism, patriotism, parental authority, free expression, free enterprise, religious
*  pluralism, cultural diversity. They're coming for everything. So national conservatism must
*  come for them.
*  I think that that's one of the best distillations of sort of that view of the world that I've
*  read. And it seems to cut across all of the strands of national conservatism or the new
*  right, whether it's Catholic integralism or national conservatism. It is this idea of
*  wielding the power of the state in a punitive way, not just in a way that's advancing a
*  particular set of policies, but also in a way that's designed to destroy political opponents,
*  to end their influence in American life. Is that a fair summary?
*  Yes. And so that's why I have tried to coin the term will to power conservatism as an
*  alternative to common good conservatism, which I think is pretty self-serving and obviously
*  doesn't tell us anything. Because of course, I believe in the common good very much as
*  well. We have different ideas about how to go about pursuing the common good. What differentiates
*  us is that they have that will to power. They want power and they want to wield it to destroy
*  their enemies and to reward their friends. And that phrase, to use power to reward friends
*  and punish enemies is an explicit quote from that conference and from some of these self-identifying
*  national conservatives. They say that that's what they're for. But I would draw something
*  else out from that excerpt from the speech that you were just mentioning, which is really
*  important, I think, to understanding what's going on here, which is that it is reactionary.
*  It is a reaction against what they perceive as egregious violations of the rule of law
*  and of classical liberalism from the left. So they say the left is not abiding by the
*  bargain that we had where we don't try to destroy you and you don't try to destroy us
*  and we coexist peacefully. The left is unwilling to play by those rules. And so we must respond
*  in kind. Because they have kind of a point in some cases, they're not completely imagining
*  that. It means that they are able to hold their heads up high and believe that they
*  have the moral high ground while even as they succumb or give in to their temptations to
*  use power in this way.
*  Yeah, I think the free speech arena is a good place to locate some of these differences.
*  So, for example, I litigated First Amendment cases for most of my career. I've only been
*  a journalist for only eight years and I was a litigator for more than 20. So I'm dating
*  myself right now. But one thing that I litigated for more than 20 years were university speech
*  codes. In other words, universities were enacting policies that were designed to sort of cleanse
*  the university space from so-called hate speech. But these speech codes have been struck
*  down in court repeatedly. And it has seemed to me that that First Amendment context has
*  been where it's most acute, whereas the classical liberal defense to an illiberal speech code
*  was open up the marketplace of ideas. The new right defense to a speech code is no,
*  no, no, our speech code instead of your speech code. So that would be, for example, the Ron
*  DeSantis StopWoke Act, which limits speech even in higher education, classroom speech
*  in higher education regarding race, for example. Or in many of these states where you've seen
*  bans on, for example, drag queen events or bans on events related to drag queens that
*  no, no, we're going to use the power of the state to target expression that we don't like.
*  It seems to be as a way of showing the different ways that state power should be exercised.
*  Yeah, and they openly explicitly reject liberal neutrality. So they would say this idea that
*  we can have a state that just calls balls and strikes and doesn't throw its weight behind
*  one side or the other, that that's a fantasy, that it never happens that way in practice.
*  What really happens is that the state is constantly throwing its weight behind the left. This
*  is the story they tell themselves. And so we should stop even aspiring to any kind of
*  neutrality or any kind of impartial adjudication by the state and say, nope, we're going to
*  use that power the way we want to use that power to impose our will against them.
*  Okay, so that's the ideology. It's a very state centric ideology. It's designed to exercise
*  state power on behalf of right wing ideas with the goal to ultimately eradicate or dominate
*  your opposition. But the cultural part of it to me, Stephanie, is almost more salient.
*  The way in which the new right interacts with its ideological competitors, the way in which
*  the new right interacts with each other really gives a flavor for sort of the kind of people
*  that they want exercising power. So if you're talking about pulling more power into human
*  beings in government, it becomes quite fair to ask, okay, well, who are these human beings?
*  What is the culture of this movement that wants to exercise so much power? I find that
*  there's insufficient attention paid to the culture. You've been in AtCon3, you have been
*  reading these folks for years and years. How would you sort of sum up the culture of the new right?
*  In a word, angry, aggrieved, right? I want to go back to something I said, which is that
*  there are a whole bunch of different factions and currents that are sort of coexisting under
*  the banner of the new right. And so actually, the folks on stage at the National Conservatism
*  conference, if you can believe it, are the most respectable faces of this movement. What's happening
*  in the shadows and mostly online is many of the same themes, but amped up on steroids and dialed
*  up to maximum inflammatory-ness, right? And so it depends a little where you're looking. If you're
*  looking at where the self-proclaimed public intellectuals of the new right in the NatCon
*  movement are and what they're saying, you're going to see one thing. And if you go to 4chan,
*  or even, you know, corners of Twitter, you're going to see something that's similar, but again,
*  worse. So it depends a little about which part of the culture you're looking at. But they're angry.
*  Again, they feel like what characterizes the Reaganite conservative consensus or right of
*  classically liberal conservatism was weakness and an unwilling to treat politics for what it is,
*  which is, to borrow a phrase, war and enmity. And so they just think that those of us sort of on the
*  other side of the divide are weak and unwilling to see reality for what it is. And so it's angry
*  and it's militant and it's extremely self-consciously and sometimes comically, almost in a caricatured
*  sense, masculine. Right. Okay. We're going to, we're going to drill down on that for a minute,
*  but I want to talk about the anger for a moment. The anger that I have seen isn't
*  just an ideological anger. In other words, it's not just, I'm angry about ideas and sort of angry
*  that this idea is still advanced and I believe doesn't work. They're angry at people. They're
*  very angry at individual conservatives. So for example, there was a, an essay written several
*  years ago called against David French ism. So not just sort of against classical liberalism,
*  but against very specifically me and my brand of classical liberalism. And it, that essay went
*  viral and it turned into a debate in Catholic university that got pretty heated. It's all so
*  very personal. And so here's the question that I've, I've long had. Part of this feels like
*  a legitimate intellectual exercise. In other words, the role of the state in a large, diverse,
*  multi-ethnic society is a matter for debate. The extent and the scope of the first amendment is
*  certainly a matter for debate. And we can have good faith debates about this all day long,
*  but what's happening in the new right is it seems to be taking place against the backdrop of
*  personal animosity. And what I am having difficulty parsing out is how much of the
*  personal animosity is driven by ideology and how much of it is driven by quite literally a desire
*  to sort of tear down one set of people and stand in their place. In other words, this is a
*  combination of personal ambition and ideological enmity. And it strikes me that there's a lot of
*  very personal beef that is attached to this ideology. Yeah, it's tribal for sure. And so
*  an example, this is a little bit less personal. I haven't had anybody write against Stephanie's
*  slayism yet. But what you saw in the second half of the 20th century was the idea that in order for
*  conservatives to succeed, you have to build a big tent, right? Bring a bunch of people under the
*  same tent and come together and create some sort of a functioning coalition. That is not definitely
*  not the approach here. Instead, it's like if you speak out against us on even one thing ever,
*  you are the enemy. Even if you are actually quite close to us ideologically, if you don't pledge
*  allegiance to us and to our tribe, you are just as much the enemy as the far left is. And so somebody
*  coming at this from the libertarian camp, I definitely see that they perceive me as an enemy
*  because I am consciously attempting to stand in the way of their desire to use power against the
*  left. Not because I agree with the left, but because I disagree with using power in that way.
*  But so I'm seen as an enemy. And so they have no compunction, you know, they have no sense of like,
*  let's build a coalition or let's get ahead by making friends. It's much more about purity
*  in tribal allegiance. All right, now let's talk about masculinity, because I'm so glad you brought
*  that up. That is a pervasive theme here. So it is not just that our ideology is, they would say not
*  just that their ideology is more superior to progressive ideologies or classical liberalism,
*  to all the competitors. They also make some very specific claims about the masculinity of their
*  views. In other words, that the movement, both as an ideological and cultural matter is an authentic
*  expression of what real masculinity is. And it seems like a largely male dominated space. NatCon
*  doesn't strike me as nearly as gender diverse as even CPAC, for example. What are you seeing as
*  you're looking at this phenomenon? Because it has been an absolute, I'm not going to say undercurrent,
*  it's often the main current. I think that's absolutely right. I mean, and it's even more
*  heightened if you move again off the stage at NatCon, where they've made at least some effort
*  to at least showcase diversity or, you know, give the perception of diversity. And if you go into
*  these online spaces, which is where most of the foment is actually happening, it's overwhelmingly
*  male. It's young men on the right that we're talking about here, overwhelming. There are very
*  few women, there are few and far between who are seduced by these ideas. On the other hand, even if
*  we were to take a step back and just talk about the Trump phenomenon, which of course was both,
*  you know, men and women who lined up behind Donald Trump and who swept him into office in 2016.
*  If you were to ask them why they supported him, why line up behind Donald Trump, why is he your
*  man? And if you expected them to give some sort of an ideologically coherent answer,
*  you would be disappointed. The answer was he fights, right? Right. That is the way that they
*  would characterize what he has that other people don't is he fights. So that's kind of the theme here.
*  So that's actually a perfect segue. So you have a lot of personal animosity. You have a lot of
*  commitment to this ideology as a matter of masculinity. So this is going deep into identity.
*  And then let's bring up the race angle of this. And this is where you're going to start to see
*  where a lot of this starts to get really, really grim. And what you've begun to see is a lot of
*  people online dabbling in explicitly anti-Semitic language, dabbling in anti-Semitic dog whistles,
*  sometimes not that dog whistly, sometimes just like referee whistly, very loud. So you see an
*  anti-Semitic strain. You've seen a strain talking about the virtue of ethnicity, of defending
*  particular ethnicities. You'll see things, for example, like Charlie Kirk tweeting, for example,
*  about how great it is to be white. And you see this real racialization of the movement. You hit
*  on a word reactionary, reactionary. And whatever you see the left latch onto as an issue, the new
*  right is going to latch onto in sort of an equal and opposite way. And one of the ways we've seen
*  this is in the matter of race. As the left gets more anti-racist, there seems to be a pull and
*  parts the new right to flirt with, if not jump in to outright racism often appears to be as a troll
*  or a troll that turns genuine. What's going on? I think there's two parts of this. One is the more
*  intellectual part of it. And in this case, I don't mean that as a compliment. And the other part is
*  the more populistic groundswell component of this. On the intellectual side, there are people
*  who, and they coined terms like race realism and human biodiversity. And they're making a case for
*  why in some cases, in the most extreme cases, for why some races are superior to others. And they
*  want to call upon race and IQ science and they want to compare crime trends. And they want to
*  build an intellectual case for why we ought to care about keeping America pure in some sense,
*  racially pure in some sense. And then that trickles down, of course, into their policy
*  preferences of low or no immigration and very aggressive policing in our cities, in black
*  communities and that sort of thing. That is actually the more intellectual, it's probably
*  actually the more disturbing part. But that is the part that is where they're attempting to put
*  a veneer of science on top of what they're doing. I think there is this other thing, which is a
*  little closer to what you were talking about, which is that there's just a lot of people out
*  there who did not start out caring about this. If anything, they came up again in that paradigm of
*  ideally race is irrelevant. We ought to care about the content of your character and not the color
*  of your skin. That that being the ideal that we are striving towards in America and that that's a
*  worthy ideal. I think most people, even the vast majority of people on the right of center, start
*  there. But as it seems like identity becomes the only thing that the left wants to talk about,
*  and as they tend to approach, the left is seen as approaching this in a sort of zero sum way where
*  advances or achievements on behalf of previously marginalized groups come at the expense of the
*  status of other groups, then it heightens the salience of those identity characteristics
*  and it creates a backlash. So there's a lot of people that I think they're not reading,
*  you know, the race and IQ stuff. They're not reading the literature on this and putting
*  together an intellectual case for racism. They're just saying race is becoming more salient in our
*  politics. The other side is injecting race into our politics. And so we're going to react in the
*  natural way, which is to think more about, you know, race as an important part of our identities
*  as well. I think it's somewhat of a natural backlash that's happening, which isn't a defense
*  of it. But I think that the bigger phenomenon here actually is that sort of stuff that's bubbling up
*  from the bottom as a reaction against, you know, among the among the grassroots, as opposed to the
*  people who are reading these these blog posts and and doing the intellectual stuff. However,
*  the intellectual stuff has now come out from the shadows recently. And that is disturbing. The
*  fact that these folks feel that they can talk openly about this and that people who are have
*  dabbled in this stuff are finding their ways into positions of influence in our mainstream politics.
*  That's the thing that has changed. Yeah. And then you also add onto it one final layer,
*  which is actually taking delight in the anger or misery of your enemies. So you're going to enjoy,
*  if you're a member of the New Right on this Culture, when you make people angry. So you're
*  going to want to press boundaries. You're going to want to go a little further than you're,
*  quote, supposed to go. If you're pushing the discourse to the edge and beyond, if you are
*  advocating ideas that were previously considered to be unspeakable, that that is what they would
*  call based. It demonstrates that you don't care what people think of you. You have the strength,
*  you have the strength of will, etc. That is what sort of this dynamic that says we're actually
*  trying to hurt your feelings for lack of a better term. We're actually trying to make you angry as
*  part of this culture. Yeah, it's transgressiveness as the source of social capital. And it's
*  especially the case again in these online communities. So to the extent that we're focusing
*  on this young men online, which is where a lot of this stuff is happening, but it's not, you know,
*  I can't go to that conference and report on it. So we're not going to be naturally, we're not going
*  to be focusing on it as much. And because up until recently, those folks also were not in positions of
*  influence in our country. It was easy to overlook that and focus on what's happening in the more
*  intellectual levels. But yes, transgressiveness, being intentionally provocative and even
*  inflammatory, dancing right up to the line and crossing it and daring someone to call you out
*  for it and then laughing at them for being a snowflake if they do. It's irony. The culture of
*  these spaces is what defines them, not the ideas. Yeah. And let's make it kind of concrete. There's
*  a lot of examples of individuals who it's been a consistent pattern, Stephanie, really since 2016,
*  which is a young, usually male figure on the right, gained some notoriety almost always
*  initially on Twitter with some very edgy rhetoric, really kind of pushing the boundaries of what's
*  within the Overton window, which is kind of a term for the zone of acceptable conversation.
*  They're always sort of right on the edge of that. And then you find out that in private,
*  they've been saying even worse things. And then as their public voice evolves, it gets worse and
*  worse and worse and to the point where sort of the private starts to merge with the public.
*  And then when they're called out or when it's exposed, sometimes they'll say, hey, that's not
*  me. Sometimes I'll just say, hey, don't even try cancel culture on me. It almost like it's baptizes
*  their expression. Their expression is the worst sin is not their expression. It's the imposition
*  of cancel culture. And so thinking of example, like a young man named Pedro Gonzalez, who
*  rose to prominence in the last five or six years. And when I say prominence, I mean sort of like
*  Twitter prominence, not a famous person, but rose to Twitter prominence so much so that he was
*  considered a DeSantis influencer earlier in the campaign. And his cycle was basically this. So
*  he's very overtly aggressive in his Twitter persona. One of his trademarks was when he
*  saw somebody he hated, he would put a picture of them or particularly unflattering picture of them
*  and talk about their physiognomy. And he got called out for doing this because at one point
*  he did it to a Jewish economist. And he called that the Rothschild physiognomy, which has,
*  it's not just subtly anti-Semitic, it's like really anti-Semitic. But then his defense was,
*  well, I say that about everybody, Jew or Gentile. I'm not anti-Semitic. I'm just hateful in general,
*  I guess is the defense. Then later on it emerges that a lot of the things that he'd said in private
*  messaging groups with people who are also in the New Right were not just subtly or dog whistly
*  anti-Semitic, but extremely aggressively and also with a lot of racist content.
*  And then as this comes out, he said this really interesting thing to the free beacon, the Washington
*  free beacon. He attributed the remarks to his dissent and to what he described as an online
*  Trump world that embraced absurd rhetorical extremism. What starts off as joking can very
*  quickly become unironically internalized as an actual belief. He said, adding that I said those
*  things and I take responsibility for them and I apologize for them and ultimately it's on me.
*  And he said he had a change of heart since becoming a father. He said, you develop a kind
*  of revulsion for the immature. He defines these extremely online movements, the kind of performative
*  bigotry that's a feature of it. So here he was being pretty self-aware, I would say. And I think
*  the really key element here is this statement. What starts off as joking can very quickly become
*  unironically internalized as an actual belief. And the way I describe it is from trolling
*  to conviction. And I have seen this pattern time and time and time again. I have a piece where I
*  wrote and I had example after example after example of that. And it's as if the trolling develops in
*  a momentum all its own, that it can't be ironic anymore. It has to be a matter of conviction or
*  you're not really with the team. Yeah, you are what you pretend to be, right? So a lot of these
*  conversations, because he's of course not the only young right-wing activist who has been outed in
*  this way in the last few months. And often the conversation turns to trying to parse whether or
*  not the things that were said or done reflected the severely held belief of the person. If you
*  incorporate Nazi imagery in a campaign video, does that make you a Nazi, for example? And some of
*  those conversations may be worth having, but ultimately I think what you're pointing to is why
*  that conversation is kind of irrelevant. Because ultimately you are what you pretend to be. And
*  these young men who play act or another phrase that I've heard used is larping live action role
*  playing, which is a sort of gaming word, right? They're play acting or they're larping as neo
*  fascists or choose your adjective, but maybe they start out as play acting. But at some point,
*  they're also spreading those ideas to other people. And Pedro Gonzalez has like 150,000
*  followers on Twitter. So I would always prefer to receive an apology than not and to hear somebody
*  express some regret. But the damage is continuing to be done, whether or not they believe what
*  they're saying, they're spreading the ideas and the fallout from that can potentially be enormous
*  especially because we're talking about the culture that the next generation is being steeped in.
*  I think your point about you are what you say is particularly salient because the common pushback
*  that you get is sort of how dare you believe that what I said was what I actually meant.
*  So you had this DeSantis staffer who has the Sonnenrad, a Nazi symbol that's between two
*  lines of troops. So not exactly subtle, right? And one of the defenses is no, he obviously doesn't
*  believe that, or this is a person who had said before about Nick Fuentes, who's one of the most
*  notorious just out and out white supremacists in the United States that in many ways Fuentes was a
*  better model for conservatives than say Ben Shapiro. Time and time again, there's this argument
*  that, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. You don't think we're actually fascist, do you? I mean,
*  you can't hold this against us, but how is anyone supposed to know that your true beliefs,
*  your true self is somehow fundamentally opposed to what you say?
*  S.S. Such an important point. And I'm glad that you brought up Fuentes. He is in some ways,
*  I hate to elevate him like this even rhetorically, but he is in some ways the man behind the curtain
*  for a lot of this stuff. Among the young men that I talk to, college age and just out of college,
*  I mean, this is who they're looking to. He's such a huge influencer online. He's like, I think he's
*  the self-proclaimed king of the dissident right. And he has this huge following. He puts out these
*  videos and he has said explicitly that the use of jokes and irony are important for giving a lot of
*  quote, cover and plausible deniability for our views. So he's admitted this openly that they're
*  using irony to make it so that you can never hang anything on them. They can say what they believe
*  or what they don't believe. How could we possibly know the difference? And then they can always have
*  deniability by keeping it light and ironic and jokey. And a lot of people have learned that skill
*  from Nick Fuentes, including the young man you were referring to who lost his job on the DeSantis
*  campaign after using this Nazi imagery. S.S. Yeah, it's really remarkable the level to which
*  this guy Nick Fuentes keeps coming up. I mean, then to say that he's irrelevant. Well, he had
*  a meal with Donald Trump and he is a model for a lot of, again, mainly young men, which is remarkable.
*  S.S. All this is interesting. All this is disturbing in many ways, but how pervasive is this? How much
*  does this matter? Or is this just sort of interesting only because, oh, it's always fascinating to find
*  out about really obscure and dangerous subcultures, but they're not, how dangerous are they really?
*  It's a hard question because it's a live debate right now. The sort of future of the conservative
*  movement of the Republican Party, all of this is being actively litigated in real time. And we
*  don't know which of the factions or which side of the liberalism schism, as I called it, is going
*  to come out on top, is going to actually sort of define the future of this movement. Once we expand
*  the lens from this sort of more intellectual new right, or what I earlier called the more respectable
*  new right, into the dark corners of the internet where people are watching Nick Fuentes' videos and
*  exchanging anti-Semitic and misogynistic messages in their private group chats that we can't see,
*  then you actually start to see even other disturbing things. So Nick Fuentes has hosted
*  events. In fact, I was at CPAC in 2022, which was in Orlando, Florida, and the night before
*  he hosted a rival, he called it AFPAC, America First PAC. It was a rival. I essentially described
*  it as CPAC for people who think CPAC isn't racist enough. Marjorie Taylor Greene was there. She spoke
*  at AFPAC at the Nick Fuentes event, and then the next day she was on the main stage at CPAC. So
*  there's definitely bleeding of the lines between this stuff. What starts out, again, in the dark
*  corners of the internet, and you think, well, how important could this 25-year-old kid really be?
*  Then you start to see these ideas and people associated with these ideas showing up in the
*  actual halls of power. All of that said, I think it's really important to recognize that I do not
*  think that the average American voter, even the average Republican primary voter, is even aware of
*  most of this stuff. To the extent that they are in any way buying into any of this, it is entirely
*  what I described earlier as the sort of bubbling up from the ground up of just saying something
*  has gone wrong in the left. There really is a liberalism on the left as well, a willingness
*  to use state power to enforce their will upon us. We don't want to take it anymore. We want somebody
*  who will fight back against that. But it's not very well thought out. I do think when it comes
*  to the racial stuff that the way forward is a return to sort of color blindness or an approach
*  in which we say it should be irrelevant what the color of your skin is. What we care is about who
*  you are on the merits and what's inside. That, I think, is a winning message even among most
*  conservatives now. But there is definitely an open question about which direction the movement is
*  headed. Since there are people articulating these two paths, one of which is really ugly racialist,
*  race realist stuff, then we have to care about whether it's going to go down that path, whether
*  the movement is heading that direction or not. Yeah, I would put it like this. I would say,
*  if you dive into the intellectual aspects of this, like we did at the very start,
*  and you run them by your average Trump supporting Republican, say where I live in Williamson County,
*  Tennessee, they would look at me like, come again. What are you talking about? Use of power for the
*  common good, to punish enemies and reward fri... What? That would not compute. There's still a lot
*  of sort of background level Reaganism, limited government, fighting against socialism, etc.,
*  etc., although there is a lot of animosity towards the left. So they're very willing to hear the
*  fight, fight, fight message. But there's a couple of aspects here. One is Trumpism is kind of an
*  ideological void. What is Trumpism? Besides the ambition of Donald Trump and into that ideological
*  void, a lot of people are pouring a lot of different things. We've talked about the intellectual
*  new right. Well, there's also this sort of pop culture Christian right, like the Michael Flynn,
*  seven mountain dominionism, very sort of Christians are destined to rule this country kind of strain
*  that gets poured into this. But here's where Stephanie, I think that the young new right
*  has an advantage over all of these other streams trying to put some sort of flesh and bones on
*  Trumpism is that they tend to be highly educated and many of them living in DC and so therefore
*  are going to be disproportionately staffing the next Republican administration. And they have been
*  hardcore in institution building mode in the last few years. So they're launching new online
*  journals and they're standing up organizations that help seek out college students who subscribe
*  to these views and funnel them into internships on Capitol Hill in the Senate or wherever. They're
*  putting a lot of thought and effort in a really sophisticated way into how do we take our ideas
*  and translate them into actual exercises of power. They said that that's what they believe in. They're
*  trying to do it. And there's another example of this phenomenon. Being Catholic, I try to keep an
*  eye on what's going on in the sort of Catholic integralist space. I can't emphasize enough that
*  the average Catholic in the pews has never heard of Adrian Vermeule, who is sort of leading Catholic
*  integralist intellectual in America today. He's a Harvard law professor. He's written a book on this.
*  People who are paying attention to the intellectual currents are reading Adrian Vermeule. The average
*  Catholic in the pews has never even heard his name, let alone the word integralism. They're not buying
*  into this. However, what I am hearing from people who would know is that the young men studying to
*  be Catholic priests, the seminarians, are paying attention and they are buying into these ideas.
*  And so even if Catholics today are not interested in this, if the next generation of Catholic priests
*  have bought into these ideas, that is scary. That is a scary thought. That is a potential vector in
*  which we could see this incredibly fringe set of ideas actually enacted in real ways in the real world.
*  You used a term and I've used a term and I just realized we probably haven't defined it very well.
*  Catholic integralism. What is integralism?
*  So this is one of the strains of the new right, one of the currents that's under that umbrella
*  category. And I think it's probably the most fringe of all in terms of the actual number of
*  people who believe in it. But it has gotten a lot of attention because it has these high-profile
*  advocates such as Adrian Vermeule. It's a rejection from a Catholic perspective of the separation of
*  church and state. And so they say that church and state ought to be integrated. That doesn't mean
*  that they should necessarily be the same thing. But depending on who you talk to, actually,
*  a lot of times what they'll say is, well, we need a civil government and we need the church
*  government, the church hierarchy. But if they're ever in conflict with each other, the civil
*  government ought to be subordinated to and take its cues from and in fact could be ordered around
*  by the pope, by the Catholic hierarchy. Because the pope, the church, is concerned with our
*  eternal salvation, which is a higher order good than our mere temporal salvation, which is what
*  the government is in charge of. And so civil government exists to do the will of the church
*  if needed. Again, this is like a very wonky thing that not a lot of people are buying into.
*  But it does have historical antecedents, right? Because if you think about medieval Europe,
*  this is closer. This is sort of the ideal theory for what they were attempting to accomplish in
*  medieval Europe. And so these are people today who are saying, well, maybe we didn't do it
*  perfectly back then, but that's still what we ought to be striving for.
*  So we're going to get into some of the weeds here because, but it's important to get into these
*  weeds because these kinds of debates and arguments really are animating a lot of the most politically
*  motivated young men on the right. There's this kind of fantasy world in which, and I'm sure
*  you've seen this Stephanie, where people will extol, for example, the experience of the medieval peasant
*  as a substantially superior way of life than what we have now, the rise of what are called the
*  rad trads. In other words, a radical traditional Catholic perspective. So this is all percolating
*  in subcultures, but again, hyper politically engaged subcultures. But what's the difference
*  between Catholic integralism and Christian nationalism writ large?
*  There's some overlap, but as a general matter, as I understand it, Christian nationalism tends
*  to be a Protestant phenomenon and it's nationalist. It's explicitly and self-consciously saying we are
*  an ethnic body. We ought to be trying in some sense to maintain our homogeneity as a people,
*  as the American people. And that the important characteristic is that we are a Christian people
*  and a Christian nation. And so that leads to policy preferences like limiting or ending
*  immigration from non-Christian countries and non-Protestant countries. And Catholic integralists
*  tend to not be as concerned about the nationalistic side of things, in part because
*  the Catholic Church is a universal church. In fact, more immigration from Latin America would
*  probably increase our Catholic character as a country. So there's not really any reason in
*  principle for a radical Catholic to be opposed to immigration. That doesn't mean that every
*  radical Catholic is in favor of open borders, but in terms of the theory here, it's more universalistic
*  and it's more about subordinating all the countries of the world to the one true leader
*  in the Pope, right, and the one true faith. So there are definitely theoretical differences.
*  In practice, there's a lot of overlap in terms of preferences, in terms of domestic policy that
*  people in these camps would be for. Maybe not so much on the international side, but domestically,
*  they're going to be talking about things like making it harder to get a divorce, requiring stores
*  to be closed on Sundays, perhaps bringing back prayer and Bible reading to public schools.
*  There's more and less radical versions of this. So the more radical versions might be, say,
*  reestablishing a test in which you have to affirm your faith in God or to a particular church in
*  order to be able to run for office or serve on a jury, or even the most illiberal and most
*  troublingly illiberal versions of this would say, we're going to ban mosques in this country. This
*  is a Christian country. You cannot practice a religion that isn't the religion of the country.
*  There are very, very vanishingly few people would even think about defending that, but they are out
*  there and they are publicly articulating these views. And because, as we talked about earlier,
*  the culture of these online new right communities, you gain cultural capital, but by being as
*  transgressive and edgy as possible, then flirting with these ideas becomes a way forward. It becomes
*  a way to gain status within your online community. Well, and also it's tied to your masculine
*  strength, right? So you see this in the pro-life community is right now torn apart by debate
*  between sort of traditional pro-life advocates and what are called abolitionists. And abolitionists
*  strongly believe in prosecuting women who have abortions. That is a core element of abortion
*  abolitionism. And one of the ways in which they engage in this conversation or engage in this
*  fight is by essentially attempting to bully anyone who is in disagreement that you don't really want
*  to protect babies. You don't really believe babies are a human life equivalent to other human lives.
*  And in this kind of pattern of, I'm going to stake out the most extreme position, and then anyone
*  who's one inch to my left is woke and has to be fought viciously if necessary, it is the pattern
*  here. What can be done? Is this the future of the right or what is it that can be done to pull people
*  back from this precipice? I really do think this is a live debate. It's a live question. Where is
*  the conservative movement going to go? What is the future of the Republican Party going to look like?
*  And anybody who thinks they know for sure what the answer to that is, you know, it has to be
*  fought out and, you know, at the level of ideas and at the level of, again, practical institution
*  building. So I don't know the answer about what the future looks like. I like this question,
*  though I'm a little bit apprehensive about the answer I want to give. I think we ought to
*  remember the difference between fault and responsibility. Of course, the people adopting
*  these horrifying views, they are to blame. And I would never in any, even the slightest way,
*  want to sound like I am justifying or excusing them. But I do think that there are ways in which
*  our approach among libertarians, among classically liberal conservatives, and on the left as well,
*  approach to advocating for social change can make it more or less likely that the more radical
*  elements of the new right will be successful. And so if we treat social change as zero sum,
*  if we act as if any advance toward justice for one group of people comes at the expense of another
*  group, that is going to provoke backlash and that is going to empower the worst voices that we've
*  been describing. There is an alternative to that approach of social change as zero sum. We can talk
*  about it as positive sum. And if you look at the ways that, for example, gay rights activists in
*  the 1990s and early 2000s advocated for the change that they were in favor of, they did it in an
*  inclusive way. They did it by humanizing their cause. They did it by talking about equal rights
*  under the law and liberal values like that. And in some cases, even in appealing to conservative
*  values, family values, family formation, lifelong commitment. So they achieved an incredible feat,
*  really, in terms of you look at the polling data about how quickly public opinion changed on support
*  for gay marriage, for example. It was rapid and it was dramatic. And that is the kind of activism
*  success story that they're going to be, there are going to be textbooks written about. And I think
*  if we're being honest with ourselves, we compare that to the kinds of activists in the gender
*  politics space today, or really any kind of social justice space today. We find that they have adopted
*  a very different approach to pushing for the things they believe in which it is much more
*  militant and much more retributive against anyone. Not just we want equal rights under the law, but we
*  want to punish you if you do not line up behind our views. I think that is a huge mistake. It is
*  definitely empowering the worst voices on the right and making it much harder for people like
*  us to counter them, because then they can point to us as enablers of the cultural rights defeat. So
*  I would call upon folks who are on the center left, on the left of center as well, in thinking about
*  not in any way how they are at fault for this phenomenon, but what can they do? How can they
*  contribute to stopping it? Which I think, I hope we can all agree is the most important thing here.
*  All right. Three books, Stephanie, I'm eager to hear what three books I should be reading that I'm
*  not. I would recommend the book Radicals for Capitalism by my Reason magazine colleague,
*  Brian Dougherty. It is a freewheeling history of the modern libertarian movement. So anybody who
*  may be wondering what is libertarianism all about, this is the book to read. It is long and thorough,
*  but it is also thoroughly entertaining, Radicals for Capitalism. Charles Taylor's The Ethics of
*  Authenticity is a short work of political theory that I really love because it is the model of the
*  kind of thinking through of ideas and approach to ideas that I aspire to in my own work, which is
*  to say he does not say the answer is black or white, which is sort of the way so many people
*  nowadays can't help but approach every issue. So he's talking about individuals and expressive
*  individualism and authenticity and these things that many people on the right seem to think are
*  completely at odds with other goods like transcendent truth and objective morality and tradition.
*  And instead of saying one or the other of these two positions is the right one, he says,
*  let's figure out what the productive synthesis is between them. So the Ethics of Authenticity.
*  And then because I'm a huge fiction reader and I especially love big books of fiction,
*  I would recommend one of my favorite novels of all time, which is War and Peace. It's a huge
*  investment of time and it's absolutely worth it. Thank you, Stephanie. And thank you for
*  the yeoman's work you've been doing for years, diving into this movement, into this emerging
*  movement and understanding it from the inside out. And thank you for sharing your insights with
*  Ezra's listeners. Very much appreciated. Thank you for having me on. I really enjoyed it.
