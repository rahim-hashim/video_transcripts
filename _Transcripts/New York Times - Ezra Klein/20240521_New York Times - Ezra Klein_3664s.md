# A Conservative Futurist and a Supply-Side Liberal Walk Into a Podcast â€¦
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RogFZO_HvQ4)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  I don't know if you all are fans growing up of the show The
*  Jetsons. But if you were and if you were super fan enough to
*  take the internal math of the show seriously, George Jetson
*  was supposed to have been born in 2022. He would be a toddler
*  right now. And the world we live in the world my toddlers growing
*  up in it does not feel like it is a world on path to the future
*  the Jetsons imagined. A future that a lot of people in the
*  1960s thought was totally plausible by the 2020s 2030s
*  2040s 2050s. So what happened that got us off of that track,
*  not just the real track, but the imaginary track. Another way of
*  asking this question, a question that's come up a lot in the
*  book I'm writing about how liberalism changed and why it's
*  become so difficult to build is what happened in the 1970s. The
*  70s are this breakpoint between one era in our economy and our
*  government, our society and our vision for the future. And the
*  next, the 70s are when economic inequality really begins rising
*  when the environmental movement takes off when a huge amount of
*  legislation is passed in response to the harms of all the
*  building and growth that had happened since the New Deal.
*  But there's this tendency to look at the places that
*  legislation goes too far and to say, well, if we hadn't made all
*  these dumb mistakes, everything would be great. We'd be richer,
*  we'd have our moon colonies on our flying cars and our nuclear
*  energy, we would have made it to Jetsons land. But then why did
*  no other country take that path to just wipe away the politics
*  and the passions that led to the backlash against certain forms
*  of growth and technology in a lot of different countries is to
*  miss something important, something that anybody who cares
*  about growth is going to need to understand if we're not just
*  going to repeat the mistakes of the past. Jim Pethacoukis is a
*  senior fellow at the conservative American
*  Enterprise Institute. He's the author of the technology focused
*  substack Faster Please, and of the recent book The Conservative
*  Futurist. And one thing I've noticed is there are ways in
*  which I feel like he and I are asking a lot of the same
*  questions, but from very different ideological positions.
*  So I want to see where our stories converge and where they
*  differ, and what happened to the world of the Jetsons. As always
*  my email is reclineshow at ny times.com
*  Jim Pethacoukis, welcome to the show.
*  Thanks so much for having me on.
*  So I'm beginning this conversation in the early 70s.
*  Things change in the US economy on any number of charts, you
*  begin to see something happen to the line. What are some of
*  those changes?
*  The most obvious change in these, especially from an
*  economics point of view, is that the sort of rapid productivity
*  growth that we saw in the previous couple of decades that
*  economists and other experts in the 60s thought was going to be
*  a permanent state of affairs, slowed down. And other than
*  really the late 90s, early 2000s, it's been in that sort of
*  weaker state. And that it's one of the great still conundrums for
*  economists. I mean, economists still less so now would have
*  debates about what caused the Great Depression. And to me, this
*  downshift, where I call my book, the great downshift in
*  productivity growth is as significant as that because of
*  we're not where we could be if it hadn't.
*  So if it had kept growing since the 70s, as it did in the couple
*  of decades before, what would the US economy look like? What
*  would the median household income look like?
*  Bigger, more multiples more. And that was the expectation. So
*  instead of having a $25 trillion economy, you know, depending how
*  you want to slice the numbers, it could be twice as big. It
*  could be three times as big. So I don't know. I mean, I think
*  conservatively, instead of like the median family making $80,000
*  adjusted for inflation, maybe they make $150,000. I mean, it's
*  pretty significant. What that economy would look like. Well,
*  listen, to grow that fast, it would be driven by technological
*  progress. And that's what people expected in those immediate
*  post war decades. So all the sort of the kind of classic
*  retro Jetsons kind of sci fi things that people imagined back
*  then, it wasn't just sort of cartoons and films, experts,
*  technologists, CEOs, economists, all expected that kind of stuff
*  to actually happen. So nuclear powered everything nuclear
*  reactors from coast to coast, we would probably have, you know,
*  colonies on the moon and Mars cures to diseases which see my
*  crock diseases, which we still battle would be cured. All of
*  that together would be part of sort of this grand future driven
*  by rapid technological progress, which drives faster productivity
*  growth, which drives faster economic growth. There's one
*  lesson the pandemic is people don't like suffering and
*  shortages. So we better figure out a different way. I see the
*  only path forward is through growth and technology and making
*  that work.
*  What is your theory, though, of what happened in the 70s? What do
*  you see as the contributors to this slowdown?
*  I think certainly is probably multi causal. One reason I wrote
*  the book, to be honest is a paper, a paper by an economist
*  named Ray Fair, from Yale University, who noticed
*  something weird happened around the 70s. He wasn't focused on
*  productivity growth, but he looked at infrastructure
*  spending as a share of total economic spending. And he looked
*  at what was going on with the budget, where we started to
*  begin to run smaller surpluses and run budget deficits around
*  1970. And he asked the exact same question that you're
*  asking. So like, what happened? Because from those two
*  statistics, he began to wonder, like, that to me seems like a
*  society that's less future oriented than it used to be. You
*  tended to see it more in the United States than in other
*  places.
*  So what are your theories?
*  Listen, I'm not going to create a brand new theory was just that
*  all the great inventions, you know, the internal combustion
*  engine, electrification of factories and chem, all those
*  great inventions of the second kind of phase industrial
*  revolution, we've kind of squeezed all the sort of
*  productivity gains out of those and they weren't replaced by
*  another wave of great inventions. I mean, that's a
*  theory. I mean, another theory is just that as we've advanced
*  in science technology, it's just harder to climb that tree of
*  knowledge and come up with more big ideas that requires more
*  people and resources. All that is probably true. But like our
*  decisions mattered. And there are things that we did, which
*  hurt. And I hope we can reverse some of those things, because
*  that would help. And I think the two, I think, screamingly
*  obvious things that we stopped doing is we stopped spending on
*  science, research and development the way we did in
*  the 1960s. And we began to regulate our economy as if
*  regulation would have no impact on innovation.
*  What's your causal theory of why we did that?
*  I think a lot of that was because of NASA. And we won the
*  space race and there just wasn't an interest in continuing that.
*  Okay, so that's sort of the immediate short term
*  explanation.
*  So much of that was really just NASA, because I think of the
*  R&D surge as the Cold War. Right. And the Soviet Union was
*  going strong in the 70s.
*  Right, Soviet Union was going strong, but we had clearly won
*  that space race. And while we've continued to spend a lot of money
*  at R&D as a share of the economy, it's a lot less than
*  what it used to be. That's not surprising that perhaps there was
*  a shift in priorities, people did begin worrying about budgets
*  back then. And the regulation part to me also sort of isn't
*  surprising when countries become wealthier, they tend to care a
*  lot more about the downsides of economic growth. There are books
*  like Silent Spring and some events like the Santa Barbara oil
*  film, we began learning more about the radiation from
*  Hiroshima and worrying about nuclear. So that is not
*  surprising that we started to pass environmental regulation.
*  What is surprising is that when it became clear that the economy
*  was not re accelerating the way they thought that there was not
*  more of sort of a holistic effort to change that to not
*  give up on like those expectations that people had in
*  the 1960s.
*  So I've been from my own book thinking a lot about the 70s and
*  looking a lot at the politics of 70s. And from where we sit now,
*  we think of environmentalism as a liberal thing, right? The
*  environmentalists are greens, they're Democrats. And I ran into
*  this quote that Richard Nixon gives in his 1970s State of the
*  Union, that I think gives a good flavor of how different the
*  politics have become. So I want to play that here.
*  The great question of the 70s is, shall we surrender to our
*  surroundings? Or shall we make our peace with nature and begin
*  to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air,
*  to our land and to our water?
*  Restoring nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and
*  beyond factions. It has become a common cause of all the people of
*  this country. It is a cause of particular concern to young
*  Americans, because they more than we will reap the grim
*  consequences of our failure to act on programs which are needed
*  now if we are to prevent disaster later. Clean air, clean
*  water, open spaces. These should once again be the birthright of
*  every American. If we act now they can be. We still think of
*  air as free, but clean air is not free. And neither is clean
*  water. The price tag and pollution control is high. Through our
*  years of past carelessness, we incurred a debt to nature and
*  now that debt is being called.
*  What do you think when you hear that?
*  I think that's exactly what I would expect to hear for a
*  country that has gone through a period of industrialization and
*  economic growth where people had become rich enough that the
*  immediate sort of material concerns could be balanced off
*  with other kinds of concerns such as the water they're drinking,
*  the air we're breathing. Is it worth losing a little bit of
*  growth maybe to deal with that? So that doesn't surprise me. And
*  as you know, some of the key environmental legislation, we
*  still have happened under the Nixon administration.
*  A huge amount of it. I mean, I think you can make a very good
*  case Nixon is the most consequential environmentalist
*  president of the 20th century.
*  But did people back then assume that what they were doing with
*  that environmental legislation was making it very difficult to
*  build the kind of future they had imagined heading into the
*  1970s? I don't think they did. I believe they thought that the
*  economy was so strong, and that technological progress, the
*  momentum was so tremendous, that we could have cleaner air and
*  water and still have everything else. The people who voted for,
*  for instance, the National Environmental Policy Act, most
*  people thought that was kind of like a good mom and pop and
*  baseball and apple pie piece of legislation. Hey, who doesn't
*  want cleaner water? That's all what we're doing here. I don't
*  think anyone imagined that then it would make it hard to build a
*  factory that makes wind turbines in the year 2024.
*  Well, what's the evidence that that raft of environmental
*  legislation, the National Environmental Policy Act, you
*  mentioned, you know, the Endangered Species Act, we have
*  Clean Air Acts, Clean Water Acts, a lot of them work really
*  well, we really do clean up the air, the water. I mean, I grew up
*  in Los Angeles or outside Los Angeles, the smog is much better
*  today than when when I was growing up. You can see the
*  mountains. You can see the mountains. What is the evidence
*  that that is as causal in the slowdown of productivity as
*  you're putting it here?
*  After the space age, after Apollo, we didn't follow it with
*  anything, right? One thing we Nixon thought about following
*  it with was building nuclear reactors, 1000 nuclear reactors
*  from coast to coast, would it have been possible to build 1000
*  nuclear reactors from coast to coast with the emerging
*  regulatory regime that was beginning to happen? Absolutely
*  not. Absolutely not. And it became obvious, even in the
*  early 70s, that there was a problem that there was a problem
*  that was becoming harder to build. That was the case with
*  the Alaska pipeline. It became, again, you're too young to
*  remember this, but it was a running joke in the United
*  States in the 1970s, that they could not build a new dam in
*  Tennessee, because of a tiny little fish called the snail
*  darter. And that fish was preventing that fish that no
*  one could barely see it, nobody knew about it, you couldn't
*  build that dam, because that was in Endangered Species Act. I
*  think the weight of those kind of incidents, the weight of the
*  academic studies I cite in my book, have there been studies
*  looking at how much it costs to build a highway? And does NEPA
*  the National Environmental Policy Act, does it make it
*  more expensive? Does it make it harder to build? Yes. And I
*  think if you just look around right now, I don't think it's a
*  tremendous leap of imagination to think that if it makes it
*  very difficult to build a transmission line, a nuclear
*  power plant, where are the nuclear power plants? I mean,
*  they're the, you know, it's like the dog that didn't bite. Where
*  are they?
*  So let's talk about nuclear here, because nuclear is
*  interesting to me, because I basically agree with you.
*  Do you not think that NEPA had a material impact?
*  I don't think there's any doubt that the totality of
*  environmental and regulatory bills passed in the 70s, slows
*  growth, or a different way to put it is makes it hard to
*  build. I mean, it's a big part of the work I'm doing right
*  now. At the same time, when you're trying to measure or try
*  to understand what has happened to total factor productivity, I
*  think this case is a little harder to make than people
*  want it to be for a couple of reasons. But I'll give you one
*  here. Let's take nuclear. I am 100% on board with the idea
*  that we've made it much too hard to build and iterate nuclear
*  technology in this country. On the other hand, there is no
*  country anywhere that is living in the nuclear topia that
*  nuclear advocates are always telling me was possible. They're
*  countries that use much more nuclear energy than we do,
*  France being a great example. But France does not have energy
*  too cheap to meter. They do not have a wild level of energy
*  abundance. There is something here where one of the ways this
*  sounds and it sounds as when you want to read your book, is that
*  there's been this 20 or maybe 1000 or maybe trillion or maybe
*  multi trillion dollar bill lying on the sidewalk. And you would
*  expect some country to pick it up. But you know, you go from
*  the 70s forward. Nobody today is ahead of America.
*  It sort of doesn't surprise me that countries which I think
*  have been over these decades, far less innovative and pushing
*  forward the technological frontier might not be pushing
*  forward the technology of nuclear power. So you know, why
*  doesn't France have very cheap nuclear energy? Why doesn't
*  France already have these very small nuclear reactors? I'm not
*  sure what the incentive was or whether they were capable of
*  innovating to that degree. I don't know.
*  But the incentive is exactly what you're saying, right? I
*  mean, it's not a market based power system in France. These
*  are all state subsidized reactors.
*  I mean, but take South Korea, take the UAE, take China. I mean,
*  you can pick your country here. The kind of question I'm trying
*  to raise about your thesis, because it's also relevant,
*  frankly, to my thesis is if the problem is that America makes a
*  series of policy mistakes in the 70s. Why then, in the ensuing
*  five decades, don't a bunch of our competitor countries race
*  past us? There were theories that they would. Japan in the
*  80s and 90s seemed like maybe they were right. Japan was
*  going to be the future. There are a million books written in
*  the 90s about this. Germany at different times, right? But I
*  don't think you would look at anybody today, any rich country
*  of significant size and say, they really got it right. And we
*  really got it wrong. So how do you understand that if the story
*  is about mistakes we specifically made in the 70s?
*  Well, we can make mistakes that are very specific to us. And
*  other countries may have made different mistakes, even though
*  there was, as you say, this great enthusiasm in the 80s,
*  that Japan had sort of figured out that they could do economic
*  growth and innovation in a brand new way, which turned out
*  not to be the case. And then you mentioned Germany, we seem to
*  have this insatiable desire to find, at least some people do, to
*  find some other model. I don't think those models have turned
*  out better than the American model.
*  If you were to try to make an argument about why things look
*  not the same, but why nobody has achieved the Jim Pethacuchus
*  world across Canada, across Western Europe, across Asia,
*  right, all countries during this period that were rich enough to
*  do much of what you're talking about. Do you have theories that
*  unite the answer?
*  Yeah, I mean, listen, I don't think it is wrong to do sort of a
*  cross country because this productivity slowdown didn't just
*  happen in the United States. Clearly, there were some sort of
*  macro reasons, it just becoming harder and more expensive to do
*  research. Those things affected everybody. So once you've
*  assumed, okay, there was this umbrella effect that would sort
*  of make difficult to do productivity and economic growth
*  and faster tech progress everywhere. So that mattered. And
*  then to what extent do our decisions matter? At first, we
*  didn't understand what happened. And then when we did, I think
*  we just underestimated the difficulty, at least certainly
*  in the United States, of returning to fast growth. And the
*  ideas that we put forward, whether it was a little more
*  spending on this program, a tax cut here, maybe those individually
*  great ideas, but given I think, the headwinds from these macro
*  factors, sort of the tailwinds need to be much, much stronger.
*  And even now, when we're talking about spending more money on R&D,
*  I don't think it's enough.
*  Let me try some theses on you that that I think can work across
*  countries. One is it as countries get richer, they become
*  more risk averse. Some of the innovations you're talking about
*  like colonies on the moon and flying cars, they require a high
*  tolerance for risk. Maybe as societies get more affluent,
*  people have enough, their lives are good enough, they aren't as
*  motivated to take that risk. What do you think of that?
*  I think inherently people pull back from risk. You know, to go
*  back to the 70s, there are some, you know, conservative thinkers
*  who thought that capitalism was doomed because the intellectuals
*  who were separated from actually working and producing wouldn't
*  appreciate how hard it is to do that. They wouldn't appreciate how
*  hard it is actually to grow an economy. And these are the people
*  who would be our bureaucrats and they'd be focused on risk aversion
*  and creating more rules. So yeah, I think that's an obvious problem.
*  Then add in the fact that as countries get richer, they care
*  more about the environment. You see it in China, as China's gotten
*  richer, they care more about smog and for people to, I think, move
*  beyond that inherent caution, they have to believe it is worth
*  it. People need a realistic, plausible image of why it's all
*  worth it. And we used to have people who would do that for us.
*  We had public intellectuals and we had Hollywood who would say,
*  the future can be better and it's going to be awesome. And then
*  that disappeared. So who paints a future? Listen, I used to spend a
*  lot of time going on like the Drudge Report used to be, you
*  know, it's still operating, I don't think it is what it used to
*  be. And every article about technology and science and Silicon
*  Valley was, these are crazy people who want a future, an
*  inhuman future for you, where you're going to all live in tubes
*  and you're going to all have bugs. Eat bugs for, you know, no more
*  steaks, you're all going to have like bug steaks. That's just one
*  small example and I can point to pretty much every Hollywood film
*  in the past 50 years. So what is our sort of collective imagination
*  of why are we going to do this? That we don't live in a world
*  that's destined to burn, that we don't live in a world where if
*  we should have all these wonderful inventions, only the
*  people at the very rich will have it. They'll be living above us
*  on the space platforms while everybody on earth is groveling
*  around. So we've had this inability to say like, why should
*  you take a risk? And that has to change.
*  I think visions of the future to a degree people don't always
*  appreciate are built on what people see in the present. And
*  something that has been striking to me as I've done a lot of
*  research into the politics of the 60s and 70s, is that the
*  world is changing. And that's why I think that the world is
*  changing. And I think that the world is changing. And I think
*  that the world is changing. And I think that the world is changing.
*  The other thing that has struck me to me as I've done a lot of
*  research into the politics of the 60s and 70s, is how much
*  people ceased liking what they saw in the present. I'm going
*  to play a speech that Lyndon Johnson gave in 1964, talking
*  about what America looked like to him in terms that are not how
*  I think of the Great Society.
*  The water we drink, the food we eat, the very air that we breathe
*  are threatened with pollution. Our parks are overcrowded. Our
*  seashores overburdened. Green fields and dense forests are
*  disappearing. A few years ago, we were greatly concerned about
*  the ugly American. Today, we must act to prevent an ugly
*  America.
*  So one thing that I think or I've come to believe is a bigger
*  dimension here is that beauty is part of politics. And wanting
*  a beautiful world believing that you're going to get a beautiful
*  world matters, right? This is part of post-materialist
*  politics, which are, you know, very, very powerful and begin, I
*  think, strongly in the 60s and the 70s. So how do you think
*  about that dimension of it? The kind of pervasiveness of a fear
*  that the modernity people were getting from rapid growth was an
*  ugly, advertising soaked, concrete, gray, deforested
*  modernity.
*  Was that the majority opinion? Do you think that people thought
*  there was too much affluence and beauty? Again, that's a
*  preference. Some people love this notion of like solar punk,
*  we're all going to live in sort of these giant trees or part
*  tree, but you have to, you know, right. Even skyscrapers will be
*  gardens. And that is a personal preference for a kind of world
*  that I'm sure I think we're maybe taking our views now we're
*  kind of imposing on what people thought in the 1960s based on
*  one speech.
*  No, so that I can assure you I'm not doing. I'm just not yet
*  reading you chapter one and two of my my forthcoming book.
*  I'm sure those chapters are excellent. They're glittering.
*  But this politics was pervasive. I mean, there are all kinds of
*  books written about this. I mean, this is what the
*  environmental movement comes out of the environmental movement
*  is not built on climate change. It's built on conservation of
*  green space.
*  Silent spring and there were disasters. I think that's
*  legitimate.
*  And I want to push you on this, because the thing that I hear
*  you doing is wiping this to the side. That's personal
*  preference. But what we're trying to do here, right, what
*  I'm trying to do with you, there's plenty of things you and
*  I disagree on, right? You're conservative, I'm a progressive.
*  But one thing that I don't think we disagree on is that we're not
*  building enough and productivity is too low. But I'm what I want
*  to try to understand is, well, then why and why is it happening
*  in so many places? And one theory that I take very seriously
*  now, having looked at the politics, right? Tiki Taki.
*  That's a term that comes from a song recorded about what the
*  homes look like in Daly City in California.
*  Little boxes on the hillside. Little boxes made of Tiki Taki
*  little boxes on the hillside. Little boxes all the same.
*  There's a pink one and a green one and a blue one.
*  I can show you pieces written in the San Francisco Chronicle,
*  where they talk about the people moving in California like
*  locusts, right? Like they're going to just destroy the thing.
*  And I agree that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But
*  often the politically powerful beholders are the ones who live
*  in a place already. So for instance, one kind of curb on
*  productivity that I believe is really important is the
*  inability to build homes in highly productive places like
*  cities. You bring this up in your book, too. But the people
*  of power there, they like the way it looks now. They like the
*  brownstones. They don't want to see those knocked over for big
*  apartment buildings. So I agree with you, right? What you find
*  beautiful, what I find beautiful, what another person
*  finds beautiful, they might all be different. But one thing that
*  I wonder is, do you just discount the power of people's
*  aesthetic preference in politics?
*  Is it a story of aesthetics? Or is it a story of a generation
*  sort of repulsed by their parents? I guarantee the
*  parents in those tiki-taki houses probably thought those
*  are pretty good houses, probably better houses than what they
*  grew up in. I take my...
*  So why do they lose the political fight?
*  Well, because that generation was really, really big. And
*  eventually that generation took control. But okay, to get to
*  really get to your question, what is this future going to
*  look like? I could point to some possibilities. And I could maybe
*  I would love if sort of science fiction people and there are
*  people in science fiction who think that as well, that they
*  need to create images that aren't utterly dystopian. Like
*  that's an entire movement within that community. But like, I
*  wouldn't say like that's my image of the future. I want to
*  give people like the tools and make sure the economy is
*  growing. And then we can all kind of create the future we
*  want. But I don't think it needs to be one particular preference.
*  It needs to be like a solar punk vision or some other kinds of
*  vision.
*  I'm not saying we should impose one one aesthetic. But what I am
*  saying is that I think there's good reason to believe that this
*  huge generation you're bringing up, right? You know, then and I
*  take that point that the boomer generation is large. They don't
*  like what they saw. And that that happened in a lot of
*  different places at once. I mean, I have a million problems
*  politically, as you might imagine with Elon Musk, just
*  like a million problems. One reason that guy has been a very
*  successful futurist is if he takes beauty very seriously.
*  If you go less controversial, you can say Steve Jobs, who took
*  how things look, the elegance. I mean, he's a boomer. And he
*  wanted to create beautiful, elegant products. Now how you
*  translate that into a public policy that creates a beautiful,
*  elegant future. But I think Elon Musk, to some degree has that. I
*  mean, who wants to go to Mars? Really, it's cold. There's no
*  air, there's nobody there. But SpaceX has created these
*  marvelous little videos about what it would be like to get on
*  a Starship spaceship. And you get to Mars, and it's these
*  beautiful kind of domes, and it's green. And that's an
*  elegant, beautiful vision of future for a place that's none
*  of those things.
*  One thing when I think about the sort of conservatism in your
*  futurism that actually surprised me in your book, was the
*  confidence that if we pumped a bunch more money into the R&D
*  structure, we would get a bunch more output.
*  I hope.
*  I'm confident about that, at least on even days.
*  But let me, one counter argument on this, I hear sometimes,
*  right? As you mentioned, a lot of the R&D surge mid century
*  came from NASA. And when you think about the amount of money
*  NASA's had to spend on R&D in recent decades, and the amount
*  of money SpaceX had to spend on R&D, which of course, SpaceX
*  could only do that because of NASA contracts, but nevertheless,
*  they had less money. And how fast SpaceX was actually able to
*  advance rocket technology. I think it should make you wonder
*  why NASA is not as able to make advances as it once was, right?
*  And I think you could say this across a lot of domains of
*  federally funded, government funded R&D. So I think there is
*  a question of how much money there is. And there's also a
*  question of whether the structures support that money
*  turning into innovations turning into products. How do
*  you think about that?
*  Well, I mean, I'd say I think the people at SpaceX would say
*  that they stand on the shoulders of giants. So they did not have
*  to start at a baseline at zero and figure out how to get
*  something into space. So I think that's important to note, I
*  would like the government spending more money on R&D. I
*  think I would like a hard look at what they call the meta
*  science, which is, how is that money actually spent? What is
*  that process like? Are good ideas squashed? This is sort of
*  emerging area public policy, where they're taking a hard look
*  at that process. Are good controversial ideas? Are they not
*  getting funded? Like those kinds of reforms, I think would have
*  to be part of anything. And I'm not like, I'm not sure that
*  spending more I mean, great, I can point to studies, but until
*  we actually do it, I don't know. But I think we're at sort of
*  like a moment that we should try to use every plausible idea to
*  make sure we don't waste a moment that I think we had at
*  the end of the 60s, that I think we had at the end of the 90s, to
*  create a much faster growing economy. We have this, you
*  know, a burgeoning cluster of technologies that let's support
*  these technologies. And I think AI is a great example, and see
*  if like, this is possible, because I've lived through 50
*  years of what some people call the great stagnation, the book
*  I call the great downshift. I don't want that to be the next
*  50 years, because what does our politics look like, after the
*  past decade of economic tumult and stagnation? I don't want to
*  look at our politics after another decade of that.
*  Let's talk about a success story of innovations of the
*  government, which is DARPA. What makes DARPA work? And is that
*  scalable?
*  Well, I mean, if highly motivated people working on
*  very specific projects, the managers of those programs are
*  not there forever. Like they're there to create new technologies
*  that would have some sort of military application. So like the
*  easy answer is we need DARPA for everything. We need to have
*  this. Can you scale that? I would like, geez, I would like to
*  try. I would like to try scaling that I would try scaling a lot
*  of things. I think, I think it shows that despite skepticism
*  that can't accomplish anything, you can point to the successes
*  of DARPA.
*  How do you think about tolerance for failure? Because one thing
*  DARPA has is a tolerance for failure. I think part of that is
*  that it's understood and has been a sort of part of the
*  national security state. And we allow the national security
*  state to waste money. We're cool with it. The fact that some
*  things are not going to work out, we don't get mad at them.
*  On the other hand, when you have the Department of Energy give
*  out a loan to something like Cylindra, that doesn't come
*  through, there is their hearings, there's a scandal,
*  people are furious. I mean, that same program also saved Tesla,
*  which is something you hear less about. So what allows things in
*  government to make counterintuitive bets? And what
*  allows them to survive those bets failing?
*  When Cylindra happened, there was a sort of a deep skepticism
*  that the era of Bill Clinton's era of big government is over.
*  And now it seemed like the era of big government was back. And I
*  think people were waiting to pounce on that. I mean, I looked
*  at Cylindra and my immediate thought was, this is this is
*  back then like this is government failing again. So I
*  don't think I had that kind of tolerance for failure. I sort
*  of do now my personal tolerance is higher. I don't think for
*  most people in the right right now is yet particularly high,
*  especially if you're looking at it purely in a political
*  standpoint. Listen, and I'm sure you're aware of this that like
*  in the past, when there have been these government science
*  programs that have been conservatives who have picked
*  through them to try to find something that sounds like
*  ridiculous or silly, you're correct. Yes, ridiculous or
*  silly, like, why are we spending money to figure out like how
*  hamsters survive in orbit or something like that. So we
*  shouldn't pretend not to have a toleration of basic science
*  because you know, the kinds of basic science that didn't seem
*  like it had any application, like, I don't know, the theory
*  of relativity is why we have GPS is.
*  But this seems like an important reformist project on in your
*  coalition. I mean, you work at the American Enterprise
*  Institute. That is the kind of place that has made this
*  argument, right? Year after year after year after year. And it
*  probably makes it against Democrats, right? I mean,
*  cylindra, I don't I don't think cylindra was the issue there was
*  that you were in a kind of post Bill Clinton, turn against
*  neoliberalism, it was that you can make a democratic president
*  look really bad, right? And you can make the stimulus look bad
*  and you could. And to me, when I think of why I am nervous as a
*  liberal, that if I pump, we pump a huge amount of money into
*  government R&D, we're not going to get the kind of fundamental
*  advances that I'm hoping for. It's that I think a lot of the
*  major government research structures have now been built
*  to emphasize a kind of conservatism, not a conservatism
*  of the political sort, but conservatism of the, we don't
*  want to spend money on anything that could make us look bad sort.
*  And so there's a lot of peer review. There's a lot of
*  bureaucracy, there's a lot of people checking your work, the
*  grant operations are huge. And the you know, the amount of time
*  people spend checking grants, there's a big cover your ass
*  mentality. And the problem with that is like, I think actually a
*  bipartisan problem. Like on the one hand, I think liberals are
*  too trusting of process. I think liberals have become just a
*  kind of process obsessed institutional defenders. But I
*  think conservatives have in some ways created a bunch of that
*  because they've created the conditions in which people in
*  government and particularly, you know, civil servants are
*  terrified of being the ones to have done something that gets
*  their agency embarrassed in their funding cut. And so I'm
*  curious, when you think about this as a reformist project in
*  your own coalition, how do you think about that?
*  So I was listening to the podcast you did fairly recently
*  with Jerusalem Dempsey's and you know, thinking about, you know,
*  some of these issues of zoning, housing restrictions and why
*  it's hard to, you know, to build anything. And housing actually
*  is the perfect issue. Housing seems like we need more housing
*  and conservatives should like that's growth and we
*  conservatives supposed to like economic growth and tumult and
*  dynamism and people can move to high productivity cities. But
*  conservatives seem to be against housing reform. These some
*  conservatives, they don't like the idea because they view it as
*  a cultural issue, which eventually eats up everything
*  because you're destroying the suburbs, you're gonna bring the
*  wrong kind of people to our neighborhood and all that kind of
*  thing. So the people who are on the left who are looking at
*  these issues and think we need maybe need to grow faster, and
*  there's things we need to build in this country and regulations
*  are a problem and you know, funding is a problem. There needs
*  to be an ally on the right where you're certainly not going to
*  agree on everything. But like there's a common ground with
*  people who have some sort of confidence that we can actually
*  move forward on problems. But right now I think while there
*  are some pockets of that, I think on the right and in the
*  Republican Party, it just seems to be sort of more abundant at
*  the moment.
*  The one of these that blows my mind is I am not a person
*  inclined to give Donald Trump huge amounts of credit. But
*  Operation Warp Speed is one of the most successful government
*  programs ever full stop. It is just like a tremendous,
*  astounding success. Is he running on eight or 10 more
*  Operation Warp Speeds? No. Is Republican Party proposing a
*  bunch more Operation Warp Speeds for other kinds of things? As
*  far as I can tell, no. By the way, the Democrats aren't
*  either. I've talked to them about why and I kind of get the
*  sense it has something to do with whether or not, you know,
*  they want to give Donald Trump credit for things. But but here
*  you have just an astonishing, like a truly astonishing policy
*  success, we were able to pull forward a completely futuristic
*  technology in a timeframe nobody thought possible and make
*  it available for free to Americans, right? Like, it was
*  equitable. It was technological. We worked with the private
*  sector, the public sector got things out of their way. And it
*  is an orphan. And the political economy of Warp Speeds orphan
*  status is, I think one, an indictment of American politics,
*  but to also a bit of a genuine mystery. Because here, you know,
*  Donald Trump could run on this like it was a success of his
*  presidency. Nothing crickets. Why?
*  My hope has been, and as you just suggested, it has yet to be
*  realized that the pandemic would accelerate this need. I would
*  hope to accelerate technological progress and growth is a
*  perfect example of a problem that many people knew was
*  coming, right? I mean, there's a gazillion white papers that
*  we're gonna have a pandemic. But yet, despite that fact, we
*  didn't have enough ventilators, and we didn't have enough masks.
*  And what finally, despite all the white papers, all the
*  thoughts about preparation, what finally really allowed our
*  economy and our lives to go on was the fact America is a really
*  rich country, and we're really technologically advanced, and we
*  are able to solve a problem on the fly, because of those two
*  things, and that people will look at that example. And we no
*  longer have to go back to Apollo to be excited about something
*  where like, we all came together and solve the big problem,
*  beating the Russians. This time, we all came together and solve
*  the big problem. And people have yet to look at that. Instead, it
*  has sort of gotten lost. And I can blame Donald Trump for that
*  for not talking about that, like he should be talking about that.
*  And if he's not going to talk about it, I would love for the
*  Democrats to talk about it and use that as an example. But I
*  hope that eventually we'll be able to look at the pandemic
*  Operation Warp Speed as sort of proof of concept that all the
*  things we've been talking about can work.
*  One of the things that has been surprising to me in post pandemic
*  politics and policy is we've spent a lot of money since 2021.
*  We spent money on kind of stimulus for the economy,
*  support for the economy, we spent money on certain kinds of
*  pandemic preparedness. The thing we've not really spent money on
*  is vaccines. We have not put together a huge amount of money
*  that we've spent on the economy. And we've spent a lot of money
*  on is vaccines. We have not put together a huge new project to
*  try to create vaccines across an array of different diseases,
*  those possibilities of pan coronavirus vaccines, there's a
*  lot we can maybe do. And I reported on a bunch of this. And
*  what I found was that there wasn't really a constituency for
*  it. You know, there were people in the Biden administration
*  trying to get vaccine money into different kinds of bills. On the
*  one hand, they weren't finding the votes. But on the other hand,
*  the critique I would make of Joe Biden, is it nor was he out
*  there demanding it. And it got me thinking about the way outside
*  maybe climate, we underrate technological solutions to
*  political problems. One of the lines I have on this is that a
*  liberal can typically tell you sort of five social insurance
*  programs they would like to build or improve right universal
*  pre K single payer health care, you know, you can pick your
*  set. They typically can't tell you the five technologies they
*  want the government to pull forward into the present,
*  right? The five technologies, they really want to fund to try
*  to make happen. Maybe right now a little bit around energy
*  people can. But I think outside of that, it is in a way people
*  think about things. What is your answer to that if the government
*  was going to come out with it's these are the five technologies,
*  we are going to try to put money behind a clear bureaucratic
*  roadblocks out of the way of make sure you can have the
*  materials for like, what is your, you know, your five
*  technologies for social progress agenda?
*  I don't want to create like a China 2025 plan where we're
*  going to pick a bunch of technologies. And I do worry
*  about being locked in a certain kind of technological path, which
*  is why I do like basic research. And I do like to see what the
*  private sector is doing and try to support that. Like with my
*  example about, you know, deep geothermal looks like it might
*  be something but they need more money for demonstration
*  projects. I think having some sort of, you know, imprimatur
*  that this is actually going to work and is making progress. I
*  think government has a more of a role in that situation. But I'll
*  tell you, I don't know if you recall, but last summer for about
*  a week, there was this notion, and I think it was a Korean
*  researchers had figured out superconductivity, that we could
*  create these materials, which would allow us to transmit
*  electricity with no loss. And if that was possible, like,
*  everything was possible, like 90% of what Star Trek's about was
*  possible, we could build very fast, very cheap, high speed
*  rails, brand new medical devices. And then it turned out
*  that that's not the case. I'll have to admit, I thought hard,
*  maybe we need a Manhattan project for superconductors.
*  Maybe that's something all these problems we've been talking
*  about, that kind of breakthrough would utterly change our entire
*  sort of political discussion. An AI that can be 80% as efficient
*  as a human, we have a very different discussion, all of a
*  sudden, the economy can grow at a point and a half faster for
*  extended period of time. Our entitlement discussion, our
*  politics is completely different. So yeah, technology
*  driving progress driving growth, it's a different kind of
*  politics and one where we're not fighting over a, you know, a
*  fixed pie, but but how to grow the economy faster.
*  But I think and maybe this is the liberal versus in me versus
*  a conservative in you, I think this is a bit of a dodge. Because
*  if you want to pump all this money into R&D, if you want to
*  pump it all even just into basic research, someone somewhere has
*  to decide where this money is going. Right? I can imagine
*  different ways you might do that. But first, somebody has to
*  decide how we are allocating this money, how much to what kind
*  of scientists but to
*  govern is to decide as your client to governance decide and
*  people will have to make decisions on against making
*  decisions. I am against someone making a decision saying, this
*  is the kind of engine we need to have.
*  I'm not saying that that's why I'm asking you know, about
*  technologies, how we achieve the technologies, right? That, you
*  know, I'm quite agnostic on that myself. But the other thing
*  the government has to do, which I do think people really
*  underestimate, is get difficulties out of the way. So
*  I remember when I was reporting on the effort to develop a pan
*  coronavirus vaccine, and I was talking to one lab that had a
*  pretty promising candidate. And the genius vaccine expert
*  leading that lab was spending so much of their time trying to
*  source monkeys. They just couldn't get the monkeys they
*  needed to run trials. And I remember just thinking, that
*  should be somebody else's job, right? This person who has got
*  into this point in medical research that they're leading
*  this lab and getting this funding to create a vaccine that
*  could save however many lives. At no point in their career was
*  their expertise, logistic sourcing. But functionally,
*  everybody I talked to in this period was like, they're working
*  on grants, they're trying to find these these things. And if
*  you look at Warp Speed, a bunch of Warp Speed did was, you know,
*  figure out how to get the the correct materials so you could
*  transport these vaccines and you know, they wouldn't break in
*  transport, right? There's a lot of just making the jobs of
*  scientists easier. There's a lot of the government acting as a
*  kind of accelerator of innovation, but it does require
*  the government to make decisions about where it's going to focus
*  its efforts. So then I'm going to go back to my question, which
*  is after you've written this book, I mean, you write a
*  substack about the future and about all these technologies, you
*  don't have in the back of your head the five things you'd like
*  to see a Manhattan Project on a Warp Speed on. Again, to
*  govern is to choose like, what would you choose? What do you
*  think would if we really put our backs into it, it is possible
*  for us to move forward into the present and would do the most
*  good?
*  Yeah, listen, I think one technology that if we're able to
*  crack it, and there's already money pouring into it is nuclear
*  fusion. I don't think I've ever seen a cabinet officer happier
*  than when Energy Department Secretary Jennifer Granholm was
*  talking about the nuclear fusion breakthrough about a year and a
*  half ago, like that, like, there's more work that needs to
*  be done on that technology. And I think government has a role. I
*  think a lot of these energy technologies, if you talk to
*  these startups, I always ask them, like, what do you want
*  government to be doing? And of course, these guys will point to
*  some regulation. I'll say, okay, that's great. Now, I'm not
*  surprised that you said that. But what about is there some
*  aspect of technology that needs more work? And they'll, they'll
*  point to what it could be like, you know, some sort of drill bit
*  for geothermal. But yeah, so I think broadly, areas of I think
*  energy. I'm just gonna stop with energy, because that just seems
*  to be the linchpin. I mean, I'm very excited about artificial
*  intelligence and what it can do. And it can be a general purpose
*  technology that can help us, you know, do science better and come
*  up with cures. But already, you have people saying, oh, great,
*  maybe it'll do all that, but we just can't afford the amount of
*  power, we're high gonna power those data centers. So if that's
*  like the thing, if that's like a key constraint, artificial
*  intelligence, yeah, then energy is pretty important. And we
*  better be doing more work. Again, I've we've mentioned nuclear
*  fusion, but it might not be maybe it's not nuclear fusion.
*  Maybe it is geothermal. And I'm glad we're going to space. I'm
*  glad we're going to space. I love I love the space program. I
*  love the idea of us doing things in orbit. But you know what,
*  someday we may be able to use the materials from Mars to build
*  space solar panels to beam infinite amount of power to
*  earth. So yeah, I think energy is certainly a sector that I
*  would like to see more research done. And I think federal
*  government has a role.
*  How do you marry technology and sustainability? This is something
*  that I think discussions of technology often miss that there
*  are values embedded in technologies, which technologies
*  we pursue, which technologies we deploy, whether you leave
*  everything in the market, whether you have a guiding hand
*  of government, whether you're pricing carbon or not pricing
*  carbon. How do you approach the process by which we make those
*  decisions?
*  You often hear now economists talking about AI and how it
*  will automate jobs. And they'll say, well, we need the kind of AI
*  that will create new things, but less of the kind that will
*  automate people on jobs. So we need, you know, job creating kind
*  of AI, but not sort of the job replacing kind of AI, which is,
*  I think we probably need both. But I don't know of any real
*  public policy that can do that. So to me, then that's sort of
*  there's no remedy that's realistic that so I'm not going
*  to give that a lot of regard, what we need is both and say,
*  like, well, I'm going to get a certain kind of outcome by
*  tweaking the tax code in this way seems to me to be unrealistic.
*  So I guess I'm skeptical about the guiding technology sort of
*  path I think you're suggesting.
*  I don't think that's quite right. So let me give a very
*  concrete example using AI is what we're talking about. You
*  could make it possible to make a huge amount of money using AI to
*  manipulate or persuade people to buy things right to hook AI into
*  advertising. You could also say we are not going to allow you to
*  hook AI into personalized database advertising, right?
*  Those are both just choices that society can make. You could say,
*  we're gonna lie to do it, but not for anybody under 18. Right? I
*  mean, there's a million things you can do here. And the the
*  path of AI development will be different, depending on what kind
*  of things you can do to make money with it. If it turned out
*  the government had a bunch of prizes out there, where if you
*  could use AI to achieve this or that scientific goal, you got
*  $3 billion. And the answer went into the public domain, people
*  build more as in in that direction. So there are a lot of
*  ways to shape the pathway of technology. I don't know that we
*  can say we're gonna have the good kind of AI, not the bad
*  kind of AI. But the decisions we make about how we regulate AI
*  will certainly shape the pathway of AI itself.
*  Well, I mean, to use that example, I'm certainly aware
*  there are people who are, you know, don't like, for instance,
*  how tech companies make money, they don't like the advertising
*  and the targeted ads. And they feel like there's privacy issues.
*  I don't really have a problem with that. I certainly know some
*  people do. I think they call it surveillance capitalism. I don't
*  have a problem with it. But isn't it true that that revenue
*  is what is sort of financing all the R&D these companies are now
*  doing into AI and creating the kinds of models that might
*  actually not just create like better advertising, but create
*  a you know, a cornucopia of scientific advancements. That's
*  an unexpected consequence. And before we I think begin thinking
*  hard about it with this emerging technology that none of us really
*  heard of up until 18 months ago, before we started thinking about
*  ways to shape this technology, we probably should have a little
*  humility that we don't know all the things that can be we don't
*  know the paths it will take. And there might be some unexpected
*  consequences in a rush to begin shaping and guiding this
*  technology. And even people who are really upset about digital
*  platforms, I don't think they're saying, like the internet was a
*  bad idea, and we should be an analog society.
*  Is your view we should not regulate AI at all?
*  I would be very I would think very hard about very specific use
*  cases, I would think very hard about existing sorts of laws on
*  the books, things you cannot do. I think my default position would
*  be rather than try to glom on our sort of social media concerns,
*  which I think a lot of policymakers, because they feel
*  like they missed the boat on social media regulation. So now
*  they're taking those concerns and applying them to AI is to
*  think a lot about the internet, the 1990s, in which we saw that
*  it was an evolving technology, and we decided to let it evolve
*  and see what happened. That seems to be an example we've
*  forgotten because we've been so overwhelmed by social media and
*  sort of continent and privacy issues. And so that would be my
*  instinct.
*  You just mentioned that a lot of people want to rerun the social
*  media experiment, but with AI, this time getting ahead of it as
*  opposed to behind it. I think that's right. Something that I
*  think is very much the wrong metaphor, I think as more like
*  the internet or more like a foundational technology than it is
*  like social media. But on the other hand, one of my feces on
*  all of this is it in key places, we got the regulation wrong,
*  which then over time also leads to overregulation as people
*  correct aggressively and often too late. And this to me feels
*  completely core to the broader story you're telling, but not
*  something you're comfortable applying here, which is the sort
*  of growth era of the sort of early 20th century created
*  genuine harms. You have Richard Nixon talking about them, Ronald
*  Reagan as president brags about signing the California
*  Environmental Quality Act into law. And so then you have like
*  very aggressive regulation. A disagreement I have with the
*  people who call themselves AI accelerationists, the people are
*  just like a letter rip, is I think they're the real
*  decelerationists. I think if you let the Mark Andreessen's of the
*  world and so on in charge of AI, that is a perfect recipe to get
*  very aggressive, very early regulation, because one,
*  terrible things are going to happen, but two people are not
*  going to trust them. Whereas in fact, that Altman and hasabi
*  and, you know, Dario Amadei and a bunch of the others seem very
*  cautious and seem very concerned about what could go wrong, is
*  almost paradoxically leading to less regulation. And I somewhat
*  know this from reporting on these meetings are having with
*  members of Congress, because the members of Congress trust that
*  they're going to be careful and that they're sort of harm aware.
*  Now, whether or not that appears to be true, I don't know. But I
*  do think that there's a much more complicated relationship
*  between wise regulation and the social tolerance for innovation
*  and innovative risk than people sometimes give credit for.
*  I just I'm not sure where your confidence comes from. That we
*  will come anywhere close at this early stage to getting it right.
*  I mean, it did not take long after the passage of the
*  National Environmental Policy Act for the problems to become
*  obvious. And did we correct those problems? We did not. So I
*  guess I have low confidence that at this early stage, we will get
*  the regulation right. Nor do I have confidence that if we figure
*  out we've gotten the regulation wrong, that those fixes will be
*  made. Because I think, as you know, once something has passed,
*  it's very difficult to undo it. Which is why even though it's
*  been screamingly obvious for a long time that we have a
*  regulation problem, so we're making it hard to build in this
*  country, it has been very difficult to undo those rules.
*  But I guess and what I think,
*  I guess I wonder where your confidence comes from.
*  Why I don't have any confidence. That's why I'm writing a book.
*  And that's why I have a job. But I think one of the questions I
*  have here is that I think I don't, if you don't understand my
*  confidence, which I don't have, I don't understand your political
*  economy. Because you agree, you believe that society is risk
*  intolerant. You agree, you believe that its reaction to
*  things going wrong is going to be to not just regulate, but to
*  try to have a safety first approach to regulation that could
*  be very, very dangerous for innovation. The fear people had
*  of nuclear going wrong and a couple of major events like
*  Chernobyl and Three Mile Island led to a level of nuclear
*  regulation that effectively choked off the entire industry.
*  What seems to be to emerge from that is you need some way of
*  balancing the fears people both have and the fears that emerge
*  without going way too far in the other direction. But you're not
*  going to get there, right? I mean, this seems to be to be the
*  point of the history you are telling. You're not going to get
*  there telling people, Ed, just don't be afraid, don't worry
*  about it. And so I think what I'm interested in here is how do
*  you think that you strike this balance?
*  Well, no, I get I think inherently people are super
*  risk averse. So why should we be confident? I think confidence
*  comes from my core thesis, which is rapid growth. When the
*  economy is growing, people become more confident, they
*  become less risk averse. And I don't think it's any
*  coincidence that not only did we see light regulation of the
*  internet in the 1990s, but other times where we've had fast
*  economic growth, we've been able to take more risks with social
*  policy, such as the Civil Rights Act, like good things happen
*  when an economy is growing quickly. So I think like, that
*  would be very helpful if we went through a period of rapid
*  growth for us to have more confidence that like, you know
*  what, technology is going well, the economy is going well, let's
*  go easy on AI.
*  But doesn't wealth and growth lead, I mean, in the model
*  we've been talking about to more regulation to less tolerance, I
*  mean, wasn't the 70s coming on the tail end of a long period of
*  wealth and growth?
*  Right. At a certain point, right, people become more
*  willing to have less growth. But I would hope that after the past
*  half century of going through a period where that kind of risk
*  aversion has turned out to be the riskiest possible thing. I
*  mean, we're in sort of this populist moment. And one reason
*  I think that you get populist moments, because people think
*  the government is really incompetent, particularly on
*  economics. So we've had this period where we've had a war,
*  people didn't think very well, we had a global financial
*  crisis, we had a pandemic, that people, you know, maybe we
*  responded well, as we mentioned earlier, but we didn't seem to
*  be particularly well, well prepared for. So yes, I'm
*  talking about learning from history.
*  I think that's a good place to end. Always our final question,
*  what are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  One book which greatly influenced my book was a book Why
*  Information Grows, which is by a physicist named Cesar Hildago,
*  who presented a very different way of thinking about economic
*  growth, rather than merely thinking about labor and capital
*  and land, all sort of the foundational aspects you may
*  have learned in a high school economics class. He thinks what
*  matters is connection, people connecting with each other,
*  companies and people and universities, and even
*  countries. So that's sort of connection economics, and
*  economic openness is really sort of at the heart of the vision I
*  tried to give in my book. I would also recommend since I
*  write about sci fi so much on my book, the expanse series, which
*  they turned into a TV series, which I view, I may be in the
*  minority that I view as a future optimist hard science
*  series, because it shows Earth a few hundred years from now, that
*  has sort of mastered the solar system, but it's not a perfect
*  world. Like, things have gone wrong, like climate change was
*  bad, but we seem to have gotten a hold of that. And technology
*  has meant there are people out of work and on basic income. So
*  it's not a perfect world. But nothing in my vision is about
*  creating a utopia. It's about solving problems and maybe that
*  solution will create another problem. But we keep moving
*  forward. And that's what I think the expanse series does. My
*  final book is The American Dream is Not Dead by one of my AEI
*  colleagues, Michael Strain, which is sort of a no nonsense
*  look at issues like wage stagnation, income inequality,
*  and the supposed gap between productivity, there's
*  productivity again, and worker pay. And I think it's a bit of a
*  myth, but very cautious myth busting book, that what you may
*  think about all those issues may not be true. So it's pretty
*  great book.
