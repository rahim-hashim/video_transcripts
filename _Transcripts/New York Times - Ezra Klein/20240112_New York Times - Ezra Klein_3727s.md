# Should Trump Be Barred From the Ballot?
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0b9RZPuZgY)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein show.
*  So before we begin today, we have a couple of open jobs on the show.
*  Which will be central in our political and policy coverage in 2024.
*  And an associate engineer role who will be helping to engineer the show,
*  making this whole thing happen, making it into actual audio.
*  That sounds good. If either role seems up your alley,
*  you can find the links to them in our show notes.
*  I find it almost impossible to fully apprehend how crazy this political moment is.
*  So we're here, we're on the eve of the Iowa caucus.
*  Donald Trump is leading the polls by over 30 percentage points.
*  He leads in the New Hampshire primary.
*  He leads in the Republican race overall.
*  I mean, he's breached 60 in a bunch of those polls.
*  It's a huge dominant lead.
*  He's neck and neck with Joe Biden when you do horse race polls for the general.
*  So Trump looks overwhelmingly likely to be the nominee for Republicans.
*  He has an even odds shot of being the next president.
*  And at the same time, at the same time that is all happening,
*  the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump is disqualified from the ballot
*  because of his efforts to overturn the election on January 6th,
*  constitutionally disqualified, no different than if he wasn't old enough.
*  In Maine, the secretary of state followed Colorado's lead.
*  States across the country are now weighing ballot disqualification
*  measures against Trump.
*  The Supreme Court is going to take up the case.
*  And this is happening again, at the same time that Trump has four criminal
*  suits against him with over 90 internal charges in them that are all going to
*  trial in different ways or motions, immunity motions.
*  See, you have Donald Trump here in an overwhelming amount of legal and
*  constitutional trouble at the same time that he is romping to the nomination,
*  romping potentially to the general election.
*  It's hard to know what to think about all this because it requires you to weigh
*  really profound questions against each other, right?
*  The questions of letting people choose their candidates in a democracy or
*  abiding or even understanding the constitution's guardrails for
*  protecting that democracy.
*  But one person who I think has been doing a really good job weighing all this, and
*  he's done it on the show before, is my fellow columnist at the New York Times,
*  David French.
*  I had him on a while ago to talk about the beginnings of Trump's legal troubles.
*  Then when I was on my book leave, he guest hosted the show, looking in
*  depth at the criminal suits.
*  I would still very much recommend that show as a great introduction to that
*  side of it.
*  But I wanted to have him on to talk about the ballot disqualification questions
*  and whether or not Donald Trump should be allowed to run or whether it is
*  unconstitutional for him to be on the ballot in 2024.
*  I will note my voice is a little hoarse throughout this.
*  I'm recovering from that cold and cough going around everybody right now.
*  But as always, my email is Ezra Klein show at NYTimes.com.
*  David French, welcome back to the show.
*  Thanks, Ezra. Thanks for having me back.
*  I appreciate it.
*  A lot has happened since you've last been here.
*  And I want to begin with the big news, which is Colorado Supreme Court coming
*  out and saying Donald Trump would not be on the ballot, that it would not be
*  constitutional to put him on the ballot.
*  What was their reasoning?
*  Yeah, the reasoning is really pretty simple that Donald Trump's conduct
*  leading up to and on January 6th, 2021 was encompassed by section three of the
*  14th Amendment, which prohibits anyone from holding office who having once taken
*  the oath of office engages in insurrection or rebellion against the
*  constitution of the United States or gives aid or comfort to an insurrection
*  or rebellion.
*  And it was essentially saying, look, Donald Trump was a officer of the United
*  States who previously took an oath of office, committed insurrection or
*  rebellion.
*  And by the section three of the 14th Amendment, ratified after the civil
*  war is just as disqualified from holding office as if he was too young or not a
*  natural born citizen.
*  This is a clause that is trying to deal with the problem of political popularity
*  among an insurrectionist, because something you hear right now when the
*  question is whether it should apply to Donald Trump is, look, this should be up
*  to the people.
*  The public should get to vote for who they want to be president.
*  And this is a clause explicitly trying to deal with what is at least seen to be
*  a coming problem, which is what if enough of the public wants to vote for an
*  insurrectionist?
*  Yes.
*  And this is something, Ezra, I'm so glad you brought it up right up front.
*  This is an anti-democratic provision in the United States Constitution.
*  Now you can pull back and sort of say, wait a minute, David, why would you use
*  language like anti-democratic?
*  Or maybe another way of saying it would be counter majoritarian.
*  Why would you say that?
*  Because really, truly a democracy can't flourish if insurrectionists are elected
*  to office.
*  They can kill the very democracy that put them into office.
*  So it really is in a more meta level pro-democracy, but it really is truly a
*  counter majoritarian provision of the Constitution, of which as we all know,
*  there are many counter majoritarian provisions in the Constitution.
*  And so-
*  Yes, I find many of them quite frustrating.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  I say Californian with barely any Senate representation.
*  Exactly.
*  You've got the same Senate representation as Wyoming.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, there's the Electoral College, there's the Senate, there's the whole
*  bill of rights.
*  We have a lot of counter majoritarian guidelines that limit the reach and
*  scope of our democracy.
*  So that's the way liberal democracy is.
*  Liberal democracy, a good way of thinking about it is democracy with guardrails.
*  And some of the guardrails are deliberately designed to prevent majoritarian
*  oppression and tyranny.
*  So a majority can't vote away your first amendment rights.
*  A majority can't vote away your rights to equal protection under the law or
*  your due process rights.
*  So all of these things guard and protect people against majoritarian tyranny.
*  And so here, what you have is a counter majoritarian provision of the
*  Constitution enacted quite deliberately because the framers of the amendment, the
*  authors of the amendment believed and had seen that majorities can elect
*  insurrectionists and insurrectionists can be fatal to a constitutional republic.
*  And so it's quite deliberately designed to be a check on majority power in this
*  limited sense.
*  Tell me about the context in which that amendment and that clause got adopted.
*  What were the authors of it trying to prevent?
*  Yeah, this is very, very important.
*  So following the civil war, what you had was a situation where a big chunk of the
*  country is essentially under military occupation.
*  Confederates were not being prosecuted, certainly not at any scale.
*  And in fact, in 1868, Confederates were pardoned by President Johnson.
*  So there was still though a question, what do we do about the fact that we have
*  former Confederate soldiers?
*  You had the Confederate officers, you had Confederate politicians, and these were
*  the people who ran the Confederacy who before the war, many of them had been
*  public officials in the United States.
*  And if Robert E.
*  Lee wanted to, he could run for Senate and win and be a Senator from Virginia.
*  He could have a host of Confederate generals who could immediately return to
*  government if you had universal franchise and the Confederate citizens who are
*  back to American citizens again, voted.
*  They'd bring these a host of Confederates back into Congress.
*  And so they were treasonous, they were insurrectionists, they were rebellious,
*  but also they still had the support of segments of the Southern population.
*  So what do you do?
*  Well, how do you reintegrate a country together after it's been torn apart in
*  such a horrific way?
*  And so sort of the balance that was struck was we're not prosecuting everyone,
*  but here's what we are going to say is if you participate in insurrection or
*  rebellion and you've previously taken an oath of office, in other words, you're an
*  oath breaker, then you can't return into government unless Congress, by two-thirds
*  majority in both houses, says that you can.
*  And so this was a way of, if you look at the greater context of it, there was the
*  open hand being extended to former Confederates that says, we're not going to
*  prosecute you, we're not going to strip you of your property, we're going to be
*  remarkably generous given the gravity of your crime.
*  But at the same time, there was a pretty modest restriction, which was, but we're
*  not going to let you help run the place.
*  So I want to go back now to a different part of the history here.
*  We've talked a bit about how Article 14, Section 3 emerged, but my sense of how it
*  emerged with the force it has in this political moment is that there was actually
*  a law review article unusually that maybe changed the world a bit.
*  And this is a piece by William Bode and Michael Stokes Paulson called The Sweep
*  and Force of Section 3.
*  And what's interesting about Bode and Paulson is they're both members of the
*  Federal Society, they're conservative legal scholars in good standing.
*  They decide to study this for a year and they come out with this blockbuster
*  article saying, this is real, this does apply to Trump and we need to take it
*  seriously.
*  And I take much of the core of their article, not the only thing in it, but part
*  of it to be how they define insurrection, right?
*  Like looking through the textual record to try and understand what insurrection
*  meant when this part of the Constitution was framed.
*  So how do they do that?
*  What is their work and what is their conclusion there?
*  Yeah.
*  So this, I'm so glad you brought up the article and it really is sort of unique
*  amongst law review articles.
*  I was talking to Will Bode shortly after the article came out and asking about
*  the download numbers.
*  So your normal law review article might have, you know, a few dozen, but they had
*  crossed a hundred thousand very quickly.
*  And the article itself, it's a long read.
*  It's more than a hundred pages.
*  It's a tour de force of legal analysis in a very specific way.
*  It's a tour de force of originalist legal analysis.
*  I want to put my finger on that, Ezra, because this disqualification argument
*  did not get its full force through a progressive legal interpretation of the
*  Constitution, through progressive legal scholars or liberal legal scholars.
*  This came from an originalist interpretation from Federalist Society
*  conservative scholars and not just any scholars, but two really of the most
*  respected, two of the heavyweights in the conservative legal world.
*  These folks are extremely well respected and admired.
*  And so what they did is they did a classic conservative legal analysis, which
*  is let's start with text, text is king.
*  Let's start with text.
*  And the text is really easy to understand.
*  I'll read it right here.
*  It's pretty short and basic.
*  No person shall be a Senator or representative in Congress or Elector of
*  President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military under the
*  United States or under any state who having previously taken an oath as a
*  member of Congress or as an officer of the United States or as a member of any
*  state legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any state to support
*  the Constitution in the United States shall have engaged in insurrection or
*  rebellion against the same or given aid and comfort to the enemies thereof.
*  But Congress may by a vote of two thirds of each house, remove such disability.
*  So they took a look at that really basic statute and they then do the historical
*  spade work of saying, what would be the historical public meaning of these words?
*  And that's what originalism is.
*  It is not the original intent.
*  It is the original public meaning.
*  So for example, insurrection or rebellion, what would that have meant to the
*  framers of this and to the Republic when this was passed?
*  What would that have meant?
*  And so when you begin to look at the historical record and in Bode and Paulson
*  have done it, a number of other folks have done it, that you really realize that
*  the insurrection definition and the perception of insurrection that was in
*  play at that time was absolutely broad enough to encompass the January 6th attack.
*  Absolutely broad enough.
*  And now remember, Ezra, this is not a provision while it was motivated by the
*  Confederacy, by its terms, it does not apply only to the Confederacy.
*  They could have written it like that.
*  They could have said that any person who served in the Confederate army during
*  the previous rebellion or in the Confederate government during the previous,
*  they did not limit it that way.
*  They quite intentionally said insurrection or rebellion.
*  And when you go and you look at everything from Shays rebellion to the
*  whiskey rebellion, to various forms of revolt against public authority, what
*  they concluded is the definition is certainly broad enough to encompass a
*  violent attack on the Capitol conducted for the purpose of essentially pre
*  overthrowing the elected government that was about to come into office to block
*  an elected government from coming into office.
*  And so it was an attempted coup in many ways, although it wasn't, he was in power
*  at the moment, it was a coup to try to retain power, to block the peaceful
*  transition of power.
*  And the argument is essentially that's exactly what an insurrection means.
*  As you're talking about a violent attack motivated by a political or public
*  purpose that would disrupt the governing and the routine transfer of power in the
*  United States.
*  So this was Ezra, if you're somebody like me, who, who is partial to
*  originalism as a method of legal analysis, it was a great advertisement for
*  originalism because this is what it looks like.
*  This is how it's done.
*  This is how it makes sense.
*  And this is how it helps us understand provisions of an amendment that you
*  might question or have concerns about its meaning or understanding.
*  So let me take on the role of Trump's defense here, a role I often take
*  on in my life.
*  Constantly.
*  So what I might say here is that's all true.
*  Donald Trump did not engage in insurrection.
*  He believed the election was fraudulent.
*  He was consuming information sources telling him that.
*  He had tried to organize or encourage a protest that protest turned violent.
*  It turned into a riot, but that is different than Donald Trump engaging
*  himself in insurrection.
*  He might've been, you know, a little bit supportive of it.
*  He didn't stop it, but he even told them to protest peacefully and patriotically.
*  And there is nothing in there that says that a president who believes an election
*  has been rigged against him should not encourage his voters, his supporters to
*  protest, should not call up secretaries of state and try to get them to run an
*  honest election that Donald Trump was well within the law.
*  He was well within his speech rights.
*  And yes, there are people who engaged in insurrection on January 6th, but
*  Donald Trump was not one of them.
*  Well, Ezra as Mr.
*  Maga for purposes of this podcast, I would agree with you.
*  I look forward to my listener emails.
*  I agree with you if you would accurately describe the facts, but you did not
*  accurately describe the facts because what we were dealing with here wasn't
*  just a protest, it wasn't just an effort to organize a protest.
*  It certainly wasn't just an effort to ask or plead with state officials
*  to take a look at voter fraud.
*  Everything here went well beyond the bounds of all of the lawful
*  activities you just described.
*  So if you back up and you take a look at what is an insurrection or rebellion,
*  how does an insurrection or rebellion take place?
*  And so, you know, you have the Confederacy, many members of the Confederacy
*  were operating under the presumption that they had the right to vote, a right
*  of self-determination that they could vote to leave the union.
*  The union was not an eternally binding union, but a voluntary union.
*  And so members of the Confederacy very much believed that they had a legal
*  right to do what they were doing.
*  And many times believe they were standing in the shoes of the
*  revolutionaries, the 1776 generation who were engaging in their own
*  act of self-determination.
*  So there's almost always going to be a legal argument or legal pretexts
*  at some time, then supplemented by violent action.
*  And what we had here was a combination of legal subterfuge and violent action.
*  And Donald Trump was involved in both, both elements, not either one of them
*  happens without his involvement.
*  And the legal subterfuge, of course, has been charged by Jack Smith and includes,
*  for example, the fake electors scheme where people were presenting themselves
*  as genuine electors when they had not won the vote in their state.
*  And then you look at January 6th, the record is incredibly damning for Trump.
*  So not only does he summon the crowd, there are repeated instances of him
*  telling the crowd to come on January 6th, including talking about how
*  it's going to be wild.
*  We now have sworn testimony that Trump knew the crowd was armed.
*  We have sworn testimony that Trump had even urged that the mags, the metal
*  detectors that were used to try to prevent people from who have weapons
*  from getting close access to a president, the urge that they be removed or pulled
*  back because he understood that the armed crowd wasn't there to do him harm.
*  Then he tells the crowd to go to the Capitol.
*  And yes, he does say peacefully and patriotically, but when you're looking
*  at the test, Ezra, of whether a speech is actual incitement to violence, there's
*  not any one single set of magic words that inoculate you against an incitement
*  to insurrection or incitement to rebellion kind of analysis, because you
*  look at the whole of the situation, which also included Rudy Giuliani telling
*  the crowd this, we were about to be on trial by combat.
*  The entire thing is whipping the crowd into a frenzy.
*  He brings the crowd, knows they're armed, demands that they go to the Capitol,
*  says they should fight like hell.
*  All of this was set up for what occurred.
*  How about this question of intent or belief?
*  Elections do get rigged.
*  They do get stolen.
*  If Barack Obama or Joe Biden was seeing real evidence that an
*  election had to be rigged against them, I would expect them, I would want
*  them to try to fight to make sure the election was fair.
*  One argument here from MAGA types is that Donald Trump believed this.
*  If you look at the calls he's making to people like the Georgia Secretary of
*  State, if you look at the things he's saying, he appears to believe so much
*  as we can say what Donald Trump ever believes, which I think to be actually
*  an ontologically difficult thing to do.
*  But he believes that there has been a wide scale theft here and that actual
*  belief, the fact that he is trying to write what he believes to be a
*  democratic wrong is protective here.
*  Is that true?
*  No, not really.
*  So this is actually cracking the door open to a really important part of
*  the discussion, which is how much of what we're talking about has to be
*  proven in the way that you prove a criminal case.
*  Now it's true that the intent element is a necessary part of the proof in
*  the criminal case against Trump, both the Jack Smith January 6th case and
*  the Fannie Willis Georgia case, varying kinds of proof of intent are required.
*  So it's actually not the case that you have to prove that Trump knew
*  he lost to the election in many of these counts, especially in Georgia.
*  You just have to prove that he knew what he was saying in that
*  specific instance was not true.
*  So if he knew what he was saying when engaging with public officials in
*  Georgia was false, then he's in a world of hurt to use legalese.
*  And so there are intent requirements that are embedded in the criminal case.
*  That are embedded to varying degrees in each one of the criminal statutes
*  he's been charged with related to January 6th in the election.
*  This is not a criminal statute.
*  You can't look at this in the same way as a proof problem.
*  Like you have the same proof problem with a criminal statute.
*  Why do we know there's a distinction here?
*  Because the amendment does not require a criminal conviction.
*  It doesn't.
*  And again, let's look back at the historic context.
*  Why would they do that?
*  And the answer is pretty easy to state because remember this was enacted after
*  a time in which already enormous amount of amnesty had been granted to Confederates.
*  And the idea that they were going to prosecute each and every former
*  Confederate and Confederate official would have been extraordinarily burdensome.
*  Just extraordinarily burdensome.
*  And besides, there wasn't really that much of a proof problem.
*  You had an actual army that existed that had ranks that had records.
*  And so it wasn't exactly a secret.
*  It wasn't hard to determine whether any given Confederate officer official was
*  a Confederate officer official.
*  And it wasn't difficult to determine that the Confederacy was
*  an insurrection or rebellion.
*  Here, it's a little bit different.
*  It's not really that hard to determine who was at January 6th.
*  It's not hard to determine Trump's actions around that day and around that time.
*  There are some disputes on the edges and on the margins, but we know the
*  broad brushes of the story.
*  And the real question then is not did Trump do X, Y, and Z?
*  The real question is did X, Y, and Z constitute an insurrection or rebellion?
*  So you say this does not require a criminal conviction, which is true, but it
*  isn't clear what it does or does not require.
*  So if it did require criminal conviction, at least we know the venue in which it
*  needs to be proven.
*  But one of the questions I have seen different lawyers bringing up here, and
*  one way I think some people believe the Supreme Court is going to slip out of
*  deciding this, is around this question of a venue.
*  And another way of putting it is, is this provision self-executing?
*  So in Colorado, this gets decided inside the election code.
*  That's where the dispute is brought.
*  In Maine, it's the Secretary of State making the decision.
*  There's fear of what happens if you have every Secretary of State and election
*  official and election system making its own determinations.
*  And so there is this argument that this is not self-executing.
*  You would need Congress to somehow decide where the decision needs to be made
*  about whether or not Donald Trump is an insurrectionist for this to hold.
*  So can you talk a bit about that question of self-execution?
*  Yeah, that's a really good and important question.
*  So it really has two components to it.
*  The first component is does Congress have to enact legislation that says, here's
*  the circumstances under which we apply this section of the amendment.
*  Here are the rules for challenging.
*  Here's the standard of proof, et cetera, before it can be applied.
*  So that's one question.
*  Does this operate without Congress doing anything?
*  I think from the text, you can see it's self-executing.
*  And how does the text portray that?
*  Because the very last Senate says, but Congress may vote of two thirds of each
*  house to remove such disability.
*  So what it's saying is this is operative until Congress votes to remove it.
*  So it's already operating.
*  And so first it is self-executing in the sense that we don't need an act of
*  Congress to put this into play.
*  We do need acts of Congress to remove it from play.
*  The other question is if that kind of legislation is not required, what sort
*  of processes do a candidate who might contest whether they engaged in an
*  insurrection or rebellion, who doesn't agree that they were an insurrectionist
*  or rebellion, isn't there some form of due process, shouldn't they have an
*  opportunity to contest that claim?
*  And as for this is where we're going to get really wonky.
*  The government is required to give you process due process before it takes your
*  life, it takes your liberty, takes your property.
*  And so his life is not at stake.
*  His property is not at stake.
*  Does he have a liberty interest at stake here?
*  And the answer would be he has a liberty interest and running for president or
*  running for public office.
*  And when you're looking at due process analysis, a lot of the process, the level
*  of the process is due is related very much to the strengths of the liberty
*  interest in play.
*  So for example, if you're dealing with life in prison, which would be short of
*  death, the most draconian restriction on liberty possible from the government,
*  there's a lot of process that's due.
*  That's the criminal proof beyond a reasonable doubt, rights of appeal, habeas
*  relief, I mean, all of these things come into play.
*  But what if the liberty interest is I want to run for president of the United States?
*  Well, the level of process that's going to be due there is not going to be, if you
*  look at sort of the history of how we look at these things, anything like the
*  level of process required in a criminal case.
*  That's just not going to be required if the liberty interest at stake is me
*  running for president.
*  Now that doesn't mean that there isn't a constitutional requirement to give Trump
*  a fair process to challenge the findings.
*  And in this circumstance, I think Colorado is coming to the situation from
*  a pretty strong perspective.
*  There was notice, there was an opportunity to be heard.
*  There was a hearing.
*  Maine is a little different.
*  You had a secretary of state making a decision there, less sort of formal legal
*  process, but I think there is not going to be as a requirement for criminal style
*  legal process before the imposition of this section, because the liberty interest
*  in running for office is not the same, say, for example, as the liberty interest
*  in trying to stay out of prison.
*  And so I think the actual process, given Trump through the Colorado process was
*  probably sufficient, but of course that's not up to me.
*  I'm not sure I'd fully buy this.
*  I mean, I take your point that for any individual running for president is not
*  an extraordinary question of liberty, but for the country who can run for president
*  and who can appear on different ballots is a pretty important question.
*  And if you have a process that is completely undefined and you can be thrown
*  off by secretary of state, of which some are sober and take their duty seriously
*  and some are not, if you can be thrown off by pretty modest hearings within a
*  state's kind of election systems, you can imagine that going in a lot of very
*  strange directions, right?
*  I am more on the liberal side.
*  I think some of the things that the right has convinced themselves of around Joe
*  Biden or Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama being from Kenya in recent years.
*  If you take the precedent here, you can imagine a similar birth or controversy
*  playing out very differently where all of a sudden you now have kind of random
*  states throwing Barack Obama off of the ballot or somebody like Barack Obama in
*  the future.
*  I know I've messed up the time continuum here.
*  I mean, do you really buy the Supreme court would go that way?
*  And don't you think there's a real problem there?
*  I think the main situation is very sketchy.
*  If you're talking about any kind of meaningful due process, again, the
*  Colorado situation is there was much more robust process there.
*  But I, I'm also going to push back a little bit here because again, what we're
*  not wrestling with here is what we think the framers of the 14th amendment should
*  have done.
*  But what we're wrestling with here is what they did and what they did and did not
*  do.
*  And what they absolutely did not do is require a criminal conviction.
*  They absolutely did not do that.
*  They also did not specify a process.
*  And so what we're dealing with is a section of an amendment that is broadly
*  written without a requirement of a criminal conviction.
*  Okay.
*  And how do we know this is really broad?
*  Because it's not just saying engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the
*  same.
*  It also has this really kind of squish language in it that says, or given aid or
*  a comfort to the enemies thereof.
*  And so in that circumstance, what are they aiming to do here?
*  What is the meaning of this?
*  The meaning is, is a very strong message that insurrectionists or rebels cannot
*  regain access to government.
*  So what we're dealing with here, Ezra is really something that's kind of opposite
*  of what you're talking about.
*  It's creating in many ways a presumption against eligibility because if there was
*  an insurrection or rebellion and you engaged in it, or you gave aid or comfort
*  to it, aid or comfort, again, broad words, then sorry, you don't get to run.
*  It's very valid to say, should this have been written this way?
*  Isn't it preferable to say that there should have been a criminal conviction?
*  Isn't it preferable for the amendment to have laid out a precise process or maybe
*  even a better way of putting it, isn't it preferable, Ezra, that Congress would have
*  already acted under the power given to it by the 14th amendment to specify a process?
*  I think those are all very valid questions, policy questions.
*  This is a broadly worded section of the amendment for better and for worse.
*  And some of the implications can get a little alarming, but there are remedies
*  for that and the remedies include, well, get Congress to act to specify a process.
*  That's one remedy.
*  Another remedy would be to amend the section of the constitution.
*  But as of right now, this is the section.
*  And by the way, even though it's kind of broadly written, it's broadly written about
*  a very narrow circumstance, insurrection or rebellion.
*  And so that's why this has not been an issue since it was enacted.
*  I mean, this has not been something that has dominated American conversation since
*  it's been enacted for multiple reasons, but mainly insurrection and rebellion
*  mercifully is pretty rare in the United States of America.
*  You have many advantages in this conversation over me as an actual lawyer, familiar with
*  constitutional interpretation.
*  I think the only one I have over you is I am not an actual lawyer versed in
*  constitutional interpretation.
*  And I don't believe this Supreme Court is originalist in any kind of consistent way.
*  And I believe they, and I think I'm right, but I don't think that the Supreme Court
*  is a very consistent way of doing things.
*  And I think that's a very important point.
*  And I believe that the Supreme Court is not an actualist in any kind of consistent way.
*  And I believe they, and I think I'm right about this, routinely come to the positions
*  and solutions they feel they need to come to, to get to the outcomes they want.
*  And I just am not somebody who believes in the mystique of the court.
*  And I'm not somebody who believes they decide things non-politically or
*  non-ideologically.
*  And so, you know, other courts have looked at this and have not come to the view of
*  it. And when I think about the Supreme Court, I just find it very hard.
*  And we should note in Colorado, there's a split bench on this.
*  The decision was not unanimous.
*  Colorado put a stay on its own ruling, assuming the court would take a look at this.
*  And the court is going to take a look at this.
*  They've said that already.
*  How do you really imagine this going?
*  I understand your interpretation of this part of the Constitution.
*  But what do you think of their interpretation of both this part of the Constitution and
*  their role, which I think they sometimes at least play into, of being
*  some kind of stabilizing force in the country?
*  So I'm going to partly agree with you.
*  I do think it is a very heavy lift to ask the Supreme Court to declare, in
*  essence, that the front runner for the Republican nomination has either given
*  aid or comfort to a rebellion or engaged in a rebellion.
*  At a gut instinct level, it's kind of hard for me to see the Supreme Court doing
*  this something this dramatic.
*  But at the same time, every time I dive back into the text and the history, which
*  is what should be governing the court right now, it leaves them with fewer and
*  fewer options because the text in the history here is really strong against
*  Donald Trump.
*  And so what you're dealing with Trump's best case is something more along the
*  lines of, do you really want to do this?
*  Is this something you really want to do?
*  Anytime you're walking into a Supreme Court courtroom and asking the Supreme
*  Court to take truly unprecedented action, even if that unprecedented action is
*  constitutionally grounded, it's a heavy ask.
*  It's a heavy lift.
*  But at the same time, we can look through history and the record here is kind of
*  spotty.
*  Many times the court will decline to take that heavy load and often will leave in
*  place unjust systems.
*  But sometimes the court says, we have to act.
*  The text of the constitution does not permit this current situation, no matter
*  how deeply entrenched it is in the United States.
*  So an example of that is Brown versus Board of Education.
*  Even though the Southern states, they reacted with all of this massive
*  resistance.
*  There was violence.
*  People died.
*  The Supreme Court was right to say the constitution does not permit this
*  abomination of segregation.
*  They were right.
*  Even though it was a heavy lift of huge ask, extremely disruptive, so to speak,
*  of the existing status quo, they imposed the constitution.
*  So a conservative would then look and say, Hey, here's another recent example
*  where the Supreme Court did what it believed the constitution required it to
*  do, even if the consequences created massive political repercussions across the
*  United States.
*  And that was Dops.
*  Or you could look in recent presidential politics and say, has the Supreme Court
*  ever stepped into a presidential contest and settled it?
*  Well, Bush v Gore.
*  And so you can look at history and you can say, here's example A, example B,
*  example C of the Supreme Court stepping in, in a very decisive way that was quite
*  disruptive to the status quo.
*  But also at the same time, Ezra, you can point to multiple examples where the
*  Supreme Court said, no, we're not going to do that for the reasons you articulated
*  that there's also a lot of other things that are often swirling around in
*  justice's mind.
*  One of the things I always say about judicial analysis is judges or people too.
*  There is no such thing as sort of justice Tron 9,000 who dispenses justice
*  without any kind of personal connection or an underlying human legal philosophy.
*  As I wrote in The Times last week, republics are not defended and maintained
*  by cowardice.
*  If the Supreme Court in its legal judgment believes that the Section 3 of the
*  14th Amendment encompasses the president and he engaged in insurrection or
*  rebellion, then its obligation is to disqualify him.
*  Now, I do know and do understand there are legal arguments against the position
*  that I'm taking, and I don't think anyone should say that the court's illegitimate
*  if he doesn't do it.
*  But I think the arguments are overwhelming that he is disqualified.
*  And I would hope that every branch of American government would have the courage
*  to uphold the Constitution and to sustain the objection.
*  I think from the perspective of somebody who is more pro-Trump than I am, but I do
*  understand this perspective, right?
*  Just from the ambient miasma of having cable news on the televisions in the office
*  all the time.
*  You have this guy who it feels like every possible count indictment obstacle in the
*  world is being thrown at him now by the Biden government.
*  Now, it's not obviously all by the Biden government.
*  There are state attorney generals here and prosecutors and so on.
*  But nevertheless, you have 90 some indictments in four criminal cases and you have
*  now this growing movement to strike him from the ballot.
*  And I think it creates this feeling that Donald Trump is being treated in a way no
*  American politician, including some who actively fomented armed revolution, has
*  been in history.
*  Almost certainly, you're correct.
*  He is being treated differently at this point in time than any other president in
*  American history.
*  However, you have to ask why.
*  Now, the MAGA argument is because you hate him and you're persecuting him.
*  This innocent man who stands in for the hatred or the persecution you had directed
*  us. I mean, this is literally as far as we have seen, you know, essentially the ethos
*  of MAGA is they are coming for Trump sort of in lieu of coming for them.
*  This is a constant refrain you hear.
*  But the reality is he's being treated differently because he behaved differently.
*  He's having unique prosecutions because he has behaved uniquely in each of the four
*  indictments. There's either absolute proof of or strong evidence exists that Trump is
*  engaged in criminal conduct with such evidence that he's engaged in criminal conduct.
*  What are the options for a rule of law oriented democracy that applies the rule of law
*  to every single person?
*  There is no king.
*  There is no royalty or aristocracy that is immune from the rule of law.
*  And so what has happened is Donald Trump, through his unique behavior, has created a
*  unique dilemma for the United States government.
*  And so that's the situation that we're in.
*  So, yes, if MAGA looks at half of the picture and sees the unique treatment of Donald
*  Trump, it enrages them.
*  But they deny the validity of the other half of the picture, which is the uniquely
*  unlawful behavior.
*  This, to me, is an interesting talent and dynamic of Donald Trump, which is that he
*  makes the institutions of American life act more like the thing he says they are because
*  of the way he acts in the first place.
*  So he makes the media seem more like an opposition party because he acts in such an
*  outrageous, dishonest, wild confrontational way that the media covers him more
*  oppositionally.
*  He makes the, you know, what gets called the deep state seem more like a cohesive thing
*  arrayed against him because he is trying to undermine so many of the ways the government
*  works, trying to get around so many of the laws, trying to break so many of the
*  processes and procedures.
*  He makes the judicial system go after him in ways it would probably prefer not to do
*  because he so flagrantly violates the law because he actually does end up trying to
*  overturn an election.
*  And then he can say, see, I told you all these institutions are politicized.
*  They're against me. They're against you.
*  They are out to get us.
*  Yes, that's exactly what he does.
*  I mean, and that's exactly become the MAGA mindset.
*  And it essentially goes like this, as you see sort of from the grassroots up, and it
*  is, we need a disruptor.
*  We need someone who's going to burn it all down.
*  We need somebody who doesn't play by the normal rules of politics.
*  We need somebody who's going to break things.
*  And then when they elect a disruptor who tears things down, who doesn't play by the
*  normal rules of politics and breaks things, then MAGA says, why aren't you treating
*  him like every other politician?
*  And it's this double game that's constantly played.
*  And there's a series.
*  And another one is we are entitled to break the rules.
*  We are entitled to engage in behavior that is threatening, that sometimes appears into
*  violence, bullying, intimidation.
*  And then if you hold us accountable for that, we're going to respond by threatening more
*  bullying and intimidation and accuse you of being destabilizing.
*  And this is again, the kind of game that is played and always the rules apply to you
*  and never did the rules apply to them.
*  And this is a dynamic we've become incredibly familiar with since 2015.
*  Now that doesn't mean that everything that everyone has done to oppose Donald
*  Trump is either wise or lawful.
*  I mean, for example, we have seen some wrongdoing that was uncovered at the FBI
*  during the Russia investigation.
*  But the bottom line is that we're always in this sort of asymmetric situation where
*  MAGA grants itself enormous freedom of action and liberation from all norms, but tells
*  you that in response to their breaking of all norms, that you, you cannot deviate from
*  your standard treatment that you've given politicians for the last 200 years.
*  You wrote a
*  book a few years ago that quite a bit of it was imagining ways that the United States
*  could fall into civil war.
*  You had different scenarios there, but I don't think one you had, although one you
*  might now want to add is this one, which is that you have the contested disqualification
*  of a candidate, or I think here's another version of it.
*  He is not disqualified.
*  He wins despite losing the popular vote.
*  He embarks immediately on a campaign of self pardoning and widespread retribution
*  against those who he feels wronged him.
*  I mean, if you believe that Donald Trump believes he is in the right here, then to
*  him, there has been like the greatest witch hunt in history with the Biden
*  administration throwing everything it has to try to put him in jail, get him off the
*  ballot, and he's going to respond in kind.
*  I mean, he had a truth social post where he says that in response to the kinds of
*  abuses being thrown at him, even the constitution must be suspended.
*  The counter attack must be ferocious.
*  I mean, do you actually think we have the capacity in one direction or another to
*  endure this?
*  Do we have the capacity to endure what it would mean to take him off or do we have
*  the capacity to endure what it would mean if he is not taken off, but wins and tries
*  to respond in kind?
*  I think that's a tremendous question.
*  In the branching tree of possibilities, as of right now, we don't have one that
*  I'm going to say is clearly stabilizing.
*  You went through this, the deeply destabilizing scenario of if he wins, there's
*  another deeply destabilizing scenario of if he loses because we know what happens
*  from the past when he runs and loses.
*  We had a historic attack on Congress where people died, where there was hundreds of
*  police and protesters injured, hundreds of prosecutions and occupation of the
*  Capitol that we've never seen in American history except when the British occupied
*  it in the War of 1812.
*  So I honestly think as for the most stabilizing option is disqualifying him
*  from office.
*  I think that's the most stabilizing.
*  Yes, it would create a spasm of outrage.
*  No question.
*  But is it going to be worse than the spasm of outrage that we saw when he lost
*  legitimately, that was motivated by a series of lies that were spectacularly stupid?
*  The sort of idea that everything will be okay if we don't apply the Constitution, let
*  the American people make their choice.
*  I don't think that we should acquiesce in the argument that it's more destabilizing
*  for him to be disqualified from holding office than him losing.
*  Or if he wins and he starts to behave exactly the way the framers of the 14th
*  Amendment would imagine that an insurrectionist or a rebel would behave when they
*  were in office.
*  I largely agree with that.
*  I've come to think of this argument, which you hear a lot as the stability for the,
*  but not for me argument, because as you say, on the one hand, I buy the point, I
*  fully buy it, that it is destabilizing to strike Trump from the ballot.
*  And on the other hand, allowing an insurrectionist, which is what Donald Trump
*  is, with the plans that he has already articulated to take office again is a
*  profound danger to the Republic.
*  So I think of something Rich Lowry, who leads the National Review, which is a
*  magazine he used to work for, that he wrote, and he was writing about the Justice
*  Department case against Trump, but he said,
*  And yes, our institutions are not in robust health.
*  They're partially not in robust health because Donald Trump and his movement
*  have spent years undermining, attacking, discrediting them, but they're not going
*  to be in better health if he returns to office, if he faces no accountability, no
*  consequences, and just comes back in office, possibly due to a fluke.
*  You could have a situation where Joe Biden has a health crisis three weeks
*  before the election, and that is how Donald Trump wins and can now take on a
*  Sherman S campaign of vengeance across the American institutional system.
*  I think behind it is a tendency to take the potential fury of MAGA very seriously,
*  but not the dangers of MAGA in power seriously, which I think also comes from a
*  sense that Trump 2 would be a rerun of most of Trump 1, where he was largely
*  ineffective, where most of his chaos was tweets and rhetoric, not all of it, but
*  most of it, until January 6.
*  But this is something you follow, and there's been a lot of reporting on this
*  and thinking about it, and so I'm curious how you rate it.
*  Do you think Donald Trump 2, if he took office again, do you think that would be
*  really different than Trump 1?
*  Do you think we'd be dealing with a very different kind of administration, or do
*  you think that is an overblown concern?
*  I think we'd be dealing with a very different kind of administration.
*  Over at the dispatch, where I used to write before I came to the Times, Nick
*  Hattagio wrote a really interesting piece about how a lot of MAGA doesn't know
*  that Trump of 2024 is not exactly the Trump from 2016, that Trump, for all of
*  his norm breaking in 2016, both sort of had a more of a concrete platform that
*  he ran on, and also the Republican establishment had more of a role in his
*  early presidency from, you know, Tillerson, Mattis, a whole host of seasoned
*  and veteran Republicans who were part of the administration, who had been the
*  adults in the room, so to speak.
*  Mike Pence.
*  Mike Pence.
*  And much of the story of his administration is dominated by both external conflict in
*  the sense of all of the fighting between Democrats and dissenting Republicans
*  against Trump's policies, but also a big part of the story of his presidency
*  was the internal fight.
*  There was this constant internal trench warfare to try to him him in, to try to
*  prevent him from enacting his worst impulses.
*  And I think it's really important for people to understand that a Trump 2 is
*  not going to have that element to it.
*  It is not going to have all of these establishment, quote, adults in the room,
*  Republicans in there with him.
*  He's over that.
*  He's done with that.
*  He's done with that from the standpoint of his staffing, his own administration.
*  He's done with that from the standpoint of appointing judges and justices.
*  Cause remember a bunch of his appointees blocked his effort to steal the election.
*  If his own court appointees had supported his position, the whole election
*  challenge would have been a lot more awful and contentious than it was.
*  And so he's over these Republican establishment figures.
*  He's over the Federalist society.
*  And so it's a very different person coming in with much thinner program
*  other than vengeance.
*  And one part that's very important also is his allies have talked about invoking
*  the insurrection act, like right on day one of his presidency, the president is at
*  the president's sole discretion has the ability to call up both the national
*  guard, put them under his control or active duty troops like the 82nd
*  airborne, 101st airborne air assault division, and put them under his immediate
*  control to essentially restore order as he sees it.
*  But it's a very poorly written statute that puts very few safeguards around the
*  presidency.
*  And so the president really does have this discretion to call out the troops.
*  And a lot of his supporters have urged him to do that and they urged him to do it
*  during January 6th.
*  And that's extraordinarily scary.
*  And here's the way I would put the danger situation, Ezra.
*  And this is, I think, the logic of the framers of this amendment.
*  Who is more dangerous?
*  Is it an insurrectionist who is the nominal leader of an angry mob?
*  Or is it an insurrectionist who commands the most powerful military in the history
*  of the world?
*  One way I've been thinking about this is that in the Trump administration, what
*  you had was a coalition government.
*  You had a coalition government between MAGA, which was a small but growing
*  faction of the party that managed to take leadership of it, and the other traditional
*  factions of the Republican party, business and evangelicals and so on.
*  And what you have now, if Trump wins again, is a non-coalition government.
*  It's just MAGA.
*  There is no longer anything that even looks like opposition to Trump.
*  The people who opposed him in Congress have left Congress or are leaving Congress.
*  When he brought in people initially, he didn't know what he was doing.
*  He didn't know who supported him.
*  There wasn't a bench.
*  Now there's a bench, you have things like the Heritage Foundation who have been
*  trying to build out the personnel lists and the plans and so on.
*  And so you've moved from a coalition government where other parts of the
*  coalition restrained some dimensions of Donald Trump to a unified government, to
*  a non-divided government under MAGA control with sort of Donald Trump as the
*  leader and the figurehead, but also people who are much more committed to executing
*  Donald Trump's impulses than was true in 2017 to 2020.
*  I agree with that.
*  I think the term coalition government is really an excellent way of describing
*  the previous administration and the elements of the coalition over time
*  ultimately did not get along.
*  And that clash was most salient during the insurrection because here you had,
*  and Jack Smith will be able to introduce just an enormous amount of evidence that
*  even his own handpicked attorney general, Bill Barr, and many other figures in
*  the administration, his vice president, Mike Pence, were saying, no, you lost
*  Mr. President, you lost, you lost, you lost.
*  And then you had this other faction in the administration that was saying, use
*  the military to seize voting machines.
*  You, you won, fired the attorney general.
*  And we know now which faction Donald Trump went with and which faction Donald
*  Trump is still with to this day.
*  So forget about the idea of the contentiousness of the previous Trump administration
*  between establishment and MAGA.
*  It's all MAGA now.
*  And it's an even angrier version of MAGA than existed before.
*  That's one of the challenges I see.
*  And I live in MAGA country.
*  85% of my neighbors are Republican.
*  And what I would say is most Republicans are generally checked out of politics on
*  this day-to-day basis, just like most Americans are, but that subset of people
*  in my neighborhood and my community who are truly MAGA are far more radicalized
*  than they were even in 2020.
*  And it's just escalating as right.
*  I'm not seeing the temperature being turned down.
*  And sadly, and what's terrifying to me is in the larger Republican public, that
*  anger is not alienating them enough to not also pull the lever for Trump.
*  They are tired of politics.
*  They are weary of MAGA in some ways and will resist MAGA in very isolated
*  circumstances. I've seen that in my own community.
*  But when it comes to Trump, there's something about him where the rules don't
*  apply to him and the way they do even to other Republican politicians in the
*  GOP. And so MAGA is more radicalized, more angry, and in many ways more
*  dominant than I imagined it would be when I woke up the morning of January 7th,
*  2021. And I thought, finally people see what MAGA really is and they're going to
*  wake up. And it's not that they woke up really, Ezra, it's more that they checked
*  out and left MAGA in control.
*  As we speak, Trump's lawyers are arguing for an immunity claim for him.
*  What are they arguing and how do you rate their likelihood of succeeding?
*  Yeah, essentially what they're arguing is if he's acting in his capacity as
*  president of the United States, that he has a broad freedom of action because we
*  don't want lawyers coming in and we don't want judges coming in and reevaluating
*  and rethinking the really hard decisions that a president has to make in the heat
*  of the moment with partial information, when the president is acting as the
*  president in his capacity, as the president, clothed with official
*  authority, then the remedy for misconduct is specified in the Constitution.
*  That's impeachment and conviction.
*  It is not criminal prosecution.
*  And so literally while we were recording this, Ezra, there was an exchange in
*  court where the judge asked if a president ordered the murder of a political
*  opponent by the military, would he still be immune from prosecution?
*  And Trump's team said, yeah, unless he was impeached and convicted.
*  And so they really are digging in on under the notion that wait, your remedy
*  for presidential misconduct is impeachment and conviction.
*  In the absence of that, when the president is acting as the president, then he can be
*  touched by the judicial system.
*  And I think the odds of that argument succeeding are extremely low.
*  It is not a case that I have written about nearly as much or talked about nearly
*  as much because quite frankly, I think it's quasi frivolous or near frivolous
*  to argue that the real remedy here is impeachment and conviction.
*  That is a remedy that is not the only remedy.
*  And there's a lot of court precedent that really does clarify that a
*  president is not immune from the processes of law, not even immune while he's president.
*  And so I think that the presidential immunity argument is more of a delay tactic than
*  something that's actually a material threat to dismiss prosecution.
*  Didn't Mitch McConnell say that Trump would still face actual prosecution?
*  Whatever happened here?
*  Oh, yeah, that was a theme post January 6th.
*  And as we think about how we're always facing the same thing when it comes to Trump,
*  they'll say, you can't do X, you should do Y instead.
*  And then you do Y and they say, well, no, you can't possibly do Y.
*  You have to wait until Z.
*  It's always the shifting goalposts.
*  It's always a moving target.
*  And always along with the shifting goalpost and the moving target is this sort of Tony
*  Soprano esque kind of MAGA bullying that says, you know, nice little republic.
*  You got there's shame with something have to happen to it if you make us too angry.
*  So you mentioned a minute ago, Jack Smith, and I want to spend a second there.
*  So I think people constantly see that Trump has 90 some charges against him.
*  And if you're paying attention to politics,
*  atmosphere, frankly, even if you're not, I'm a professional.
*  And every time I see that number, my mind just shuts off.
*  It's like I can't handle that many charges.
*  But what you really ever are for criminal cases, each with internal indictments.
*  And so you have the Stromy Daniels, hush money case, you have a classified documents
*  case, and then in Georgia and then with Jack Smith, you mentioned the special
*  prosecutor for the Justice Department.
*  You have cases around January 6 and the effort to overturn the election.
*  And one thing you could imagine playing out over the next year, which is going to be
*  a hell of a way to have a presidential election, but nevertheless, is imagine a world
*  with the Supreme Court passes, punts, rejects, whatever it is, this idea that Trump is
*  an insurrectionist.
*  And at the same time, you have this Georgia case, you have this DOJ case that, as you
*  say, are calling all this evidence, bringing all this information forward.
*  How do you imagine those things interacting with each other?
*  Oh, man, that's right.
*  OK, so again, this is why I keep going back to this idea that you just can't concede
*  that disqualifying him from office is more destabilizing than any of the other
*  branching tree of possibilities that we have.
*  So here's one, for example, the Supreme Court says, no, he did not engage in
*  insurrection or rebellion, or maybe the Supreme Court says, no, it's not going to
*  disqualify Trump.
*  So then he's not disqualified, but he's convicted in federal court.
*  Well, being convicted in federal court, that doesn't mean that he can't run for
*  president. So you could have a convicted felon running for president.
*  And given the polarization that, you know, as you know better than anybody in this
*  country, having written just an excellent book about it, he's still going to have a
*  chance, even if he's a convicted felon.
*  And so you get into this branching tree of possibilities.
*  And how destabilizing is that to have a convicted felon who could potentially win
*  the presidency with other criminal charges?
*  Because I think it's really remote the idea that all of the cases against him will be
*  prosecuted before the election.
*  It's more likely that none of them are prosecuted before the election.
*  But you look at the branching tree of possibilities here and they're all potentially
*  destabilizing.
*  Why? Because all of the branching tree of possibilities contain a central figure of
*  Donald Trump, who is inherently destabilizing.
*  Then our final question. What are three books you recommend to the audience?
*  All right, I've got three. Only one of them is really new in any way.
*  I'm currently reading and really enjoying it.
*  It's a Max Hastings book.
*  He's one of my favorite military historians.
*  It's called Operation Pedestal.
*  And for you military history buffs who listen to Ezra, really phenomenal
*  storytelling about a pivotal convoy to save Malta in 1942 when it was under siege.
*  Just an incredible cast of characters and remarkable level of heroism.
*  And it's a really tremendous book.
*  The next one is a brand new book by N.T.
*  Wright, who's a theologian.
*  And it's called Into the Heart of Romans.
*  And this is for your theology buffs who are Ezra, who listened to your show, Ezra.
*  And it really is making a really interesting argument that the Book of Romans, this
*  pivotal book in the New Testament, has been in some important ways misinterpreted and
*  that a more proper interpretation of Romans is one that actually has a more radical call
*  to virtue. And then the next book is Back to Your History Buffs.
*  And it's called Manhunt, Twelve Day Chase for Lincoln's Killer.
*  And it's by James Swanson.
*  And if you pick it up, you start reading it and you realize it feels like I'm reading
*  almost like a script for a television crime drama.
