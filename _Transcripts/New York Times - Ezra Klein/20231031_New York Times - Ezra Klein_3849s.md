# If Not This, Then What Should Israel Do?
**The Ezra Klein Show:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7K327quaEc)
*  From New York Times opinion, this is the Ezra Klein Show.
*  So on Friday Israel began its ground war in Gaza.
*  They cut all cellular communications for 34 hours, creating chaos not just for Hamas,
*  but for the vast majority of the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in Gaza.
*  I found this line in the New York Times pretty tough.
*  Quote, they had no way to know whether their loved ones were alive or dead.
*  Emergency phone lines stopped ringing.
*  Desperate paramedics tried to save people by driving toward the sound of explosions.
*  Wounded people were left to die in the street.
*  Even hearing or seeing an explosion not far from you and not being able to call your
*  relatives who live there.
*  Palestinian health officials say that more than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been
*  killed since October 7th.
*  And I want to note here that there is a fog of war.
*  It is possible these numbers are wrong.
*  It is also of course possible that particularly by the end of this, these numbers will be
*  much higher.
*  But if you take something like the 8,000 numbers right, well then one way the horror of October
*  7th was driven home.
*  One way its scale was driven home to Americans was to put it in terms of 9-11s.
*  Adjusting for population, Joe Biden said it was like 15 9-11s.
*  If you take that same math, then Gaza's experienced so far around 400 9-11s.
*  What does that do to a population?
*  Something on my mind right now for obvious reasons is protests against Israel have broken
*  out all over the world.
*  Anti-Semitism is searching across the Chinese internet as state-run media there blames the
*  United States for quote, blindly backing Israel.
*  In Dagestan, a majority Muslim Republic in southern Russia, dozens were arrested after
*  storming an airport hunting for people who had arrived on a flight from Tel Aviv.
*  At Cornell University, the Jewish center was under guard after threats of violence.
*  A few blocks away from me, the synagogue I take my children to on weekends was spray-painted.
*  I took my kids to the park over the weekend was rerouted because the streets were closed
*  for anti-Israel protests.
*  My kids kept excitedly running to the window of our home to watch lines of police marching
*  past to keep order.
*  And I'm not convinced this will make Israel safer.
*  I fear it'll be just the opposite.
*  I don't believe the punishment being meted out on ordinary Gazans is moral or is justified.
*  But I also recognize criticism is easy and I don't live in Israel or in Gaza.
*  And so there's been this void, I think, at the heart of a lot of coverage, mine included.
*  What should Israel have done?
*  What should they do?
*  If not this, then what?
*  Zach Bechim is a senior correspondent at Vox and he's covered Israel extensively in recent
*  years.
*  And so he set out to answer that exact question and he spoke with counter-terrorism experts
*  and military historians and experts on Hamas.
*  And I found his piece, What Israel Should Do Now, one of the best I've read since October
*  7th, one of the ones most clarifying.
*  And so I asked him to join me on the show.
*  And I should note, because things are changing so quickly, that Zach and I spoke on Thursday,
*  October 26th, and a lot has happened since then, but nothing, I think, that changes the
*  analysis here.
*  As always, my email, Ezra Klein Show at nytimes.com.
*  Zach Bechim, welcome to the show.
*  Hey, Ezra, it's great to be here with you.
*  So I wanted to start with something you wrote, which is that two things are true.
*  Israel must do something and what it's doing now is indefensible.
*  And I want to take them in turn.
*  So first, why must Israel do something?
*  I spent a lot of time thinking about this question, right?
*  Because it seems like the big demand from a lot of people who are critics of Israel
*  is just, you should have a ceasefire.
*  They should stop doing what they're currently doing.
*  I heard this from Palestinians I spoke with.
*  The problem with that, from the Israeli point of view, is that the massacre of October 7th
*  not just a breach of security, but a signal collapse in the state's capacity to provide
*  for the security of the Israeli people.
*  They can't live in a world where they think this kind of thing would happen again or might
*  happen again.
*  I think about a conversation I had with Stav Shafir, who is a former member of the Knesset,
*  Israel's parliament from the Labor Party, which was a longtime stalwart of the Israeli
*  left.
*  She's a peacenik, right?
*  Her view for a long time has been two states.
*  Her politics are very focused on inequality inside Israel, right?
*  Real, not like of the far left, but a left-wing Israeli person.
*  When I spoke to Stav, the palpable pain and fear in her voice and anger and the understanding
*  of what Hamas was after this attack as being a monstrous, intolerable threat to Israel,
*  she told me, we need to destroy Hamas.
*  No qualifiers.
*  She was like, we can't live next to them anymore.
*  And when you hear that kind of thing from somebody who is so affiliated with the left
*  side of the Israeli political spectrum, it gives you a real insight into the way in which
*  Israelis of all stripes have unified around a need to do something, something really,
*  really dramatic about the Hamas threat.
*  Jews can never be tolerated again from their point of view.
*  I mean, it speaks to the heart of what Israel is as a country in their mind, right?
*  From their point of view, Israel exists because Jews were insecure elsewhere.
*  Jews needed their own country with a strong army to be able to protect themselves from
*  this kind of massacre.
*  And if civilians can be killed in such horrific ways, the state has failed.
*  And it needs to do something to show that it hasn't been a failure.
*  And an expert on Israeli politics told me this point blank, no ceasefire and no return
*  to the status quo.
*  Something needs to change.
*  What that is, that's less clear.
*  But what we do know is that that needs to be pretty dramatic.
*  Let's hold for a second on the question of a ceasefire, because as you say, that's become
*  a demand.
*  It is not going to happen at the moment.
*  No.
*  To some degree, I almost think the meta conversation of a ceasefire is whether you are allowed
*  to call for one in American politics without being sidelined.
*  But would one be a good idea?
*  I think a temporary ceasefire for the provision of humanitarian aid is very defensible, right?
*  The situation in Gaza is absolutely dire on humanitarian terms and something needs to
*  be done to deal with the spread of infectious disease, the lack of water.
*  I mean, it's truly horrifying.
*  At the same time, though, Israel hasn't done enough to deal with the problem that Hamas
*  creates.
*  So then let me take the other half of your formulation.
*  What is it doing now?
*  And why do you call what it's doing now, which is the beginning of what it's doing, indefensible?
*  So I think there's one really obviously indefensible component, which is the cutoff of electricity,
*  fuel, and water supplies to Gaza.
*  This amounts to collective punishment of civilians.
*  I mean, there's really no definition of the morality of war under which one can say, you
*  can do that to people.
*  And if you look at any dispatch from the ground in Gaza and you look and you engage with the
*  human toll and the suffering going on, you really understand that what Israel is doing
*  is hurting, really, really hurting innocent people, children, even for no good reason.
*  There are a lot of significant problems with this bombing campaign as well.
*  There are questions about how discriminated it's being in target selection and what targets
*  it's choosing.
*  But in general, I think sort of the bigger picture is it's not clear what Israel wants
*  to get out of the current offensive.
*  Their stated objective is to defeat Hamas.
*  It's not clear what that means based on the current rhetoric, and it's not clear if the
*  current bombing contributes to it.
*  And if you're going to inflict this level of suffering on civilians, even unintentionally
*  or as a byproduct of legitimate tactics, you need to have a real end point.
*  You need to know what you're doing.
*  In what you have read or heard or in your reporting, has there been an articulated goal
*  of the siege specifically?
*  I have never seen any defense from anyone of the siege that makes sense in my mind.
*  The horrible justifications that you hear from some Israeli leaders are things like
*  honestly comparing the residents of Gaza to human animals or saying something like that.
*  You've heard versions of that language twice from Israeli leaders.
*  From the defense minister.
*  Right.
*  Now, it sounded like he was referring to Hamas, but others...
*  But he was specifically talking about the siege.
*  That's what unnerved me about that statement.
*  If he said human animals and he means Hamas, fine.
*  But when what precedes it is we're cutting off food and water and electricity, that's
*  really not just from Hamas.
*  No, it just isn't reasonable.
*  It's worse than that.
*  It is an incredible amount of anger being unleashed on civilians who are basically themselves
*  held captive by Hamas.
*  Hamas is contrary to what you may hear from some Israelis, not popular.
*  People don't like living under an authoritarian, theocratic regime.
*  It's just very, very difficult to rebel and overthrow government.
*  There are things that people like about Hamas as well.
*  There are certain social services it provides.
*  They like that unlike the Palestinian authority, it stands up to Israel in some visible way,
*  even ways that strike us and are in fact morally horrifying.
*  But none of that is a justification, right?
*  Or any kind of reasonable justification for hurting this many people.
*  So let me offer two different possible rationales for the siege.
*  The first is maybe the most classic, which is you're simply literally weakening the enemy.
*  If there is not electricity and fuel and food and water going to Hamas either, I mean, you've
*  taken it from a lot of people, but going to them either, if the population is furious
*  that Hamas has done this to them, right?
*  If they do hold Hamas at least partially culpable for the Israeli punishment, then maybe you
*  make it easier to uproot Hamas.
*  You weaken Hamas as a fighting force, you weaken their hold on the population, and as
*  brutal as it is, it actually leads to a shorter, at least more winnable conflict.
*  What do you think of that?
*  So what happens when you conduct a siege like that is the resources that are left, right?
*  Generators, oil, whatever ways of scrounging up water exist, they get diverted to the military
*  opponent that you're facing.
*  So what you end up doing might not end up hurting Hamas immediately, but it will, without
*  a doubt, end up doing extraordinary amounts of harm to the civilian population.
*  The policy isn't very well thought through on a tactical level.
*  There are some advantages to it, but if you really play it out, it doesn't do, I think,
*  what some people who are okay with it think it will.
*  And that's even before we talk about the real problem with it, which is the morality,
*  right?
*  Sieges are a permissible military tactic, according to a lot of ethicists, when it's
*  really just an enemy enclave.
*  Ultimately, if there's only fighters there, it's not very different to blow them up than
*  to starve them out in moral terms.
*  But when civilians are there, it's a whole different ballgame, and there are two million
*  people in Gaza, right?
*  Hamas's fighting force, I believe the estimate is 30,000.
*  That's 1.97 million people who you're starving out, who you're depriving of water of adequate
*  sanitation of medical resources to get at 30,000.
*  To me, there's just no way to make those numbers work morally in any kind of humane or remotely
*  defensible military policy.
*  So there's another rationale that I've heard, which is if you make life in Gaza untenable,
*  if you make staying Gaza, choosing starvation or waterborne infectious disease, or choosing
*  thirst for your children.
*  If you make Gazans flee by the hundreds of thousands and tell them to do it so they're
*  not in the way of the bombs, maybe they don't come back or maybe you don't let them come
*  back.
*  So you have hundreds of thousands of Gazans just gone.
*  And one difficulty with that before is that Egypt won't let them in.
*  But if there's enough misery, maybe that pushes the Egyptian government to open the border.
*  And so that's been this other theory of what Israel might be attempting to achieve here.
*  And I'm not saying that it's moral or according to the rules of war, but it is a coherent
*  strategy if part of Israel's goal is fewer Palestinians in Gaza.
*  Yeah, it's possible that that's what it is.
*  I mean, you've heard at least from one Likud lawmaker in Israel, it's Netanyahu's party,
*  saying that what they want is a second Nakba, which means a second catastrophe for Palestinians.
*  the 1948 war, when Palestinians were in large part forced out of lands that's now controlled
*  by Israel.
*  But it's not clear to me if that's actually guiding policy based on my conversations with
*  experts in the area.
*  I don't think the goal is that well thought out or deliberate.
*  Israeli policymakers were reacting out of rage, out of panic, out of a sense of a need
*  to do something and impose a policy that they thought was justified by Hamas's attack.
*  Now, I don't think it is personally, but I think it really is more than anything else,
*  a product of feeling like there's been this incredible assault on Israel and they need
*  to do everything they can to address it.
*  So one description of Israel's strategy and where it might be going came from this interview
*  in Politico with Amos Yadlin, who's former chief of Israeli military intelligence, a
*  sort of important Israeli military thinker and to situate him, he's on the center left
*  in Israel, part of labor.
*  And he said that they are thinking of Gaza like a neighboring country run by the government
*  of Hamas and quote, we declare war on this country and we're going to destroy the state
*  very much like what the allies did to Germany in 1945, very much like what the US did to
*  ISIS to the caliphate in Iraq and Syria 2014 to 2019.
*  And so what I take him as saying is that if you shift the metaphor a bit, don't think
*  of Hamas as a terrorist organization hiding among civilians, think of them as a legitimate
*  government of Gaza, then invading Gaza and destroying the government and the state that
*  attacked you is the most normal thing of all in military history.
*  That's totally right.
*  And it also in terms of the Israeli thinking and it also came up, I mean, it's omnipresent
*  in Israeli discourse, the ISIS analogies and the Nazi analogies in particular are really
*  dominant inside the Israeli conversation right now.
*  One example, I was talking about the siege with an Israeli military historian.
*  I told him that I thought it was very difficult to defend and he said something like, well,
*  did the allies provide electricity to the Nazis during World War II?
*  He also, by the way, was a figure on the center left.
*  He said, I support a two state solution, et cetera.
*  These aren't just rabid right wingers.
*  There's a consensus in Israel that Hamas really is a neighboring government that needs to
*  be destroyed.
*  The question, I think, is what destroyed means and whether or not you support, you really
*  support what it would mean to try to launch a purely military effort to eliminate Hamas.
*  Let's hold on that for a minute because I want to get at something beneath some of the
*  defenses here that I've heard even just from Jewish people more in support of Israel's
*  current tactics in my own life.
*  One thing they say, or one thing I hear in what they're saying, is that they feel Israel
*  in 2023 is being held to laws and mores of war that did not exist really, or at least
*  were not followed.
*  When America won the wars that made America what it is today, and among other things,
*  importantly, in this defeated the Nazis.
*  When the countries that exist today won their territory, often by displacing other peoples
*  and creating mass migrations, that there is a demand on Israel to act in a way other states
*  did not have to act because it was not the modern era with all these niceties like the
*  UN and phones where you can see what people are doing on the ground.
*  But that in truth, war has always been more brutal and that when you are trying to eliminate
*  a threat like this, you have to be more brutal and that Israel is being held to an unusually
*  high standard that nobody else has demanded their countries in the past meet.
*  So I think that's partially true, but I think a lot of it has to do less with changing norms
*  and double standards than it does with the nature of the Hamas threat itself.
*  And what Hamas has done, there's actually a technical term for this in the philosophy
*  of just war, it's called perfidy.
*  It's a specific kind of abuse of the laws of war where you manipulate them such that
*  your opponent can't wage war justly.
*  When you force, essentially you use morality as a shield to protect yourself.
*  That's Hamas' strategy.
*  They want in these military campaigns, lots of Palestinian civilians to die.
*  They want them to die rather than their fighters.
*  They want them to die because that's what helps them win in the long run.
*  It gets them more support.
*  It shows that the Israelis are as brutal as Palestinians think they are.
*  It gets them international sympathy.
*  They are, the Israelis are forced into fighting a truly evil group.
*  But the fact that they've committed perfidy and that they've done horrible things doesn't
*  mean that you can just do whatever you want.
*  If that's the case, the things that Israel could do are far, far worse than the things
*  that it's already doing, which is a frightening prospect.
*  We're speaking on Thursday, October 26th.
*  As of now, they have not launched the ground invasion of Gaza.
*  The expectation is that they will.
*  I guess we will see.
*  One thing you spent a lot of time doing in your reporting is talking to experts on military
*  strategy on the region, on counterterrorism about what it would mean to invade Gaza and
*  whether it would end up making Israel safer, whether it was a good idea.
*  What did you find?
*  So, I want to start with the actual invasion itself, right?
*  We're going to send troops and we're going to try to essentially topple the Hamas government
*  as they see it.
*  Well, that's really hard in military terms.
*  Hamas has this gigantic tunnel network.
*  I've heard one description that says it's larger than the London tube.
*  Can I note something about this that I think people don't fully hear on it?
*  I think people hear this and they think Hamas has built a bunch of tunnels underground in
*  the last couple of years in order to make it harder to fight them in the ground in Gaza,
*  right, like a war fighting strategy.
*  But this is more than a decade long project with huge amounts of investment in it because
*  it is the only way the Gaza import-export economy can work.
*  And so you're dealing with a tunnel network that I think is much more stunning than people
*  are used to because it wasn't particularly at the beginning just for a war fighting purpose.
*  These are not little tunnels to hide a person in so he can pop out and shoot you.
*  These are tunnels that you can bring construction materials through, tunnels that you can bring
*  huge amounts of material in.
*  When I started to understand the depth of the tunnel network, this looked a lot different
*  to me.
*  Yeah, and that's layered on top of the ordinary challenges of fighting in an urban environment,
*  which is already on its own very, very difficult, right?
*  You have to watch from threats from the sky.
*  Drones, for example, you have to watch from threats from the building, soldiers sniping
*  at your soldiers or firing RPGs, and you have to watch at the street level, right, or whatever
*  it is that Hamas has set up on the ground, plus below you.
*  For invading Israeli soldiers, this is a death trap.
*  And second, lots and lots of civilians would die in part because of the Israeli need to
*  protect their own soldiers.
*  There's a direct trade-off in urban warfare if you're in a populated area between what
*  you do to preserve your own soldiers' life, which would involve a lot of airstrikes in
*  advance and generally having a pretty loose set of rules of engagement, and what you do
*  to preserve civilian life, which is minimizing the amount of airstrikes that you use and
*  going very slowly and putting your own troops at risk.
*  When I hear something like destroy Hamas as the objective, I think the question for me
*  that brings up is what is Hamas?
*  And a couple of answers present.
*  Hamas is people.
*  There are people who hold positions within Hamas or are kind of foot soldiers within
*  Hamas.
*  There's material, right?
*  They have caches of rockets and drones and so on.
*  It is to some degree local support, the sort of attachment from the civilian population
*  that gives them new recruits and allows them to hide within the citizenry and is why they
*  to some degree at least rule Gaza.
*  So I guess you're saying you're going to destroy those three things.
*  I'm sure there are more that you can think of, but I'm curious what you hear.
*  What do you have to destroy to have destroyed Hamas?
*  When I talk to Israelis, there is not a clear sense of what that term means.
*  And in many ways, it's really the crux of the issue.
*  There's a consensus on you need to destroy Hamas, but there's a question of what that
*  means and what it entails.
*  I think the ordinary language understanding of it and the one that is most prevalent in
*  the discussion is it means literally end the organization.
*  Destroy the organization that mounted the October 7th attacks and never allow it to
*  constitute itself again.
*  It's an incredibly tall order.
*  It's very, very, very hard to do that as any kind of military.
*  Even one is well equipped and advanced and trained as the IDF is.
*  There's another meaning of it though, which is to destroy Hamas's military capability,
*  destroy the people who were responsible for this attack and ensure that it could never
*  happen again.
*  Maybe something named Hamas will still exist after that.
*  Maybe it'll still operate.
*  Maybe it'll even still rule Gaza.
*  But you can say, if you're an Israeli, that we destroyed the organization, meaning specifically
*  the people who are in charge and executed the October 7th attack.
*  Those are two senses of the term, both of which could be used, but I get the strong
*  impression that the former is predominating in Israel.
*  Let's say they executed a ground invasion and let's say that they can do a fair amount.
*  They're able to degrade a lot of Hamas's military capabilities.
*  They're able to kill a number of Hamas's top leadership, a number of its foot soldiers.
*  So that is the million dollar question.
*  And it is the question that no one I have spoken to, and I don't think anyone in the
*  Israeli government actually has a plan for.
*  I'd really recommend reading a piece in the Financial Times on this where they got a bunch
*  of senior Israeli sources on record talking about the planning.
*  Turns out they're still planning it.
*  This piece was like, you know, at the time we're recording, it was like a day or two
*  ago.
*  We'll put this piece in show notes.
*  There's one fantastic quote in there says, the Americans went ballistic when they heard
*  that Israel had no plan for what to do in the event after Hamas.
*  Basically, I think there's sort of three options and of them, only one of them is really feasible
*  if what you really want to do is destroy Hamas.
*  So the first one is that you just go in, you wreck the place and you leave.
*  And if that happens, well, Hamas probably just reconstitutes itself.
*  We know from pretty bitter experience on the American side that you can't take out a terrorist
*  organization in one fell swoop.
*  A second option would be to install some kind of collaborationist Palestinian government
*  and then leave.
*  The problem with that is if you don't back it with armed force, Hamas or some other kind
*  of Palestinian militant, there are a lot of them in the Gaza Strip, end up toppling this
*  government and you're right back where you started.
*  So the third option and the one that strikes me as most likely based on my own conversations
*  with Israelis is an extended occupation of Gaza.
*  If you really want to destroy the entity that calls itself Hamas, right, the most literal
*  definition.
*  That's what you have to do.
*  As you go to Gaza, you occupy it for a long period of time.
*  You engage in a pretty lengthy counterinsurgency campaign designed to topple the government,
*  designed to ensure that Hamas, that its support is entirely stamped out among the population
*  and it lacks its ability to rebuild.
*  And then only then after a very long period of fighting, do you try to create a government
*  that can operate without Israeli forces on the ground.
*  This to me seems like a nightmarish option for any number of reasons.
*  But right now I'm worried based on what's coming out of the Israeli government, that's
*  what they're sort of sleepwalking towards.
*  Why is that a nightmarish option?
*  They occupied Gaza for a long time and I don't think right now the pull out and I think it's
*  strange language because it kept the blockade and a lot of control over it, but they did
*  not occupy Gaza in the way they had.
*  They did not try to govern it in the way they had.
*  And I don't think right now they look at that as a success.
*  No, I mean, Hamas built itself while Israel was occupying Gaza.
*  That's when the organization really came to prominence in the 1990s when I conducted a
*  series of terrorist attacks inside Israel that were very explicitly designed to disrupt
*  the Israeli-Palestinian peace process at that time.
*  This was Israel was still occupying Gaza.
*  So that's one thing, right?
*  That doesn't really work if you look at the historical record.
*  The other thing is looking at different kinds of historical records, namely the experience
*  of countries occupying what are essentially foreign countries in a counterinsurgency
*  campaign.
*  And it's quite bad.
*  These very often fail to accomplish their goal of creating a peaceful post-war environment.
*  They create a situation where these terrorist groups can reconstitute themselves often in
*  worse forms, right?
*  That's the origin story of ISIS.
*  It really grew out of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, which was itself not very strong until the U.S.
*  invaded Iraq.
*  One thing that I feel like people who know a lot about ISIS are being driven crazy by
*  right now is that the analogy to ISIS, which has become so popular, Hamas as ISIS, runs
*  the other way.
*  Yeah, it's like you don't want to encourage the growth of, I mean, you can't say a worse
*  version of Hamas.
*  They're already pretty horrible, right?
*  But an environment where they can reconstitute themselves in even stronger form, right?
*  Because like there are two important salient facts about how that might and probably would
*  happen.
*  The first is something that Mark Lynch, who's an expert on Arab politics, told me when I
*  was talking to him, is he's like, look, when the U.S. invaded Iraq, there were some real
*  constituencies, Shia, Kurds, who hated Saddam Hussein and had some interest in cooperating
*  with the invaders.
*  There's nothing like that in Gaza.
*  Nothing.
*  Everyone hates Israel.
*  They hate Israel because of the years of occupation prior to Hamas.
*  They hate Israel because of the blockade.
*  They hate Israel because of all the bombing campaigns.
*  There's no group in Gaza that would welcome or cooperate with an Israeli counterinsurgency
*  campaign, which means you're in there with Israeli forces who are getting shot at by
*  Hamas partisans who are hiding among the population all the time.
*  It's the nightmare scenario for any effort to try to impose governance on a society.
*  Who's going to cooperate with you?
*  Who are you going to get to run the government when you can't do it?
*  There's no plausible, to me, endgame for how you bring peace to such an environment.
*  Really the most likely outcome, this is the second thing I was alluding to, is that Hamas
*  builds its support among Palestinians because it shows itself to be resisting the Israeli
*  occupation.
*  Even if Israel has good intentions, the best possible intentions, which they may not, war
*  crimes happen as part of these occupations.
*  They do.
*  They're inevitable.
*  Every time that happens, Hamas gains new supporters.
*  Every Palestinian child who's killed by an Israeli bomb or accidentally shot by an Israeli
*  ground soldier, blown up by a tank, every single one of those is a victory for Hamas.
*  I think sometimes about the math of vengeance in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
*  One of the things that's been on my mind is our attunement to the Israeli math right now.
*  Joe Biden's saying that October 7th was like 15 9-11s when you adjust for population.
*  So Gaza is smaller than Israel, two million people.
*  We don't really know the exact number of killed Gazans at this point, but it seems safe to
*  say it's significantly higher than 1400 in a smaller area.
*  There have been many killed before this, of course, over years and years of fighting.
*  So what percentage of Gazans are one degree away or know somebody one degree away from
*  somebody killed in an Israeli attack?
*  I would assume that it approaches 100%.
*  Very high.
*  When you talk to Israelis, almost everybody knows somebody.
*  And I think we have a sensitivity to that.
*  It fills me with despair when I think about that.
*  But that is, I mean, put aside the question of Hamas, that is the wellspring of conflict,
*  whether that conflict organizes itself under the banner of Hamas or not.
*  Everything that Israelis feel right now in wanting to avenge their dead, Palestinians
*  And as you keep adding more fuel of vengeance, I mean, it does create this long term question,
*  even aside from its short term horror of like, where does that go?
*  I mean, look, the most cliche term in Middle East politics or specifically Arab Israeli
*  politics is cycle of violence.
*  But it's cliche for a reason, because it's true for exactly the reasons that you just
*  described, right?
*  When you inflict violence on one group, they demand a violent response.
*  It just is the way that this conflict has gone forever.
*  And so the purpose of violence, if what you want is peace in the end, and that is not
*  true for all of the actors in this conflict.
*  But if what you want is peace, violence should only be used as a tactical measure in order
*  to gain some degree of security that allows you to make longer term steps for peace and
*  movements towards peace.
*  And that's just not what's happening right now.
*  The Hamas attack was the opposite of that.
*  It was designed, right?
*  Some experts on Hamas think that the spectacular brutality, I mean, the truly awful description
*  of what happened to Israeli civilians on that day, I'm not going to get into them for the
*  mental health of your listeners, but it's beyond evil to hear about.
*  That was the point, right?
*  Those kinds of atrocities would force such a heavy handed response to Israel, that violent
*  the Palestinian arget would become the only acceptable cause and that the more peaceful
*  approach of the Palestinian authority and the Fatah party would be discredited.
*  In some ways, it's easy to know so much about the Israel-Palestine conflict, so much about
*  its tortured, contested history, who did what at the Camp David talks in 2000 and what was
*  going on in Oslo and the second Intifada.
*  You get really caught up in the specifics of it and often correctly so.
*  We actually know some things about terrorism broadly.
*  Sometimes I think it is useful to abstract out of this conflict and think about others.
*  You talk to Audrey Cronin, who's a military strategy expert and the author of the book
*  How Terrorism Ends, which is probably the best study of how terrorism ends.
*  What does her research say?
*  One of Audrey's main research questions was the extent to which what she calls repression,
*  violence basically of various different forms, is effective at dealing with terrorism and
*  addressing it.
*  What she found in the roughly 460 cases that she examined is that it's not.
*  It doesn't typically work.
*  There are lots of reasons for that.
*  One of them is that the amount of violence that you need to do over a long period of
*  time to repress a terrorist organization is A, huge and B, often quite indiscriminate.
*  One thing I've learned from other studies of war and conflict is that a lot of civilian
*  allegiance depends on their own self-interest.
*  If you are literally going to die because you don't collaborate with X group, then you'll
*  collaborate with X group regardless of what your ideological or other allegiances incline
*  you towards.
*  There's a great book on this by Stathis Kalevus, who's a Greek political scientist.
*  It's called The Logic of Violence in Civil Wars.
*  What that means is to really get civilians to not want to cooperate with an insurgent
*  or terrorist group.
*  A lot of the time that entails threatening their lives in very, very, very large numbers
*  directly and intentionally committing war crimes.
*  A good example of this is the Sri Lankan military's defeat of the Tamil Tigers.
*  Took many years, was extremely bloody, and involved wide-scale repression of the Tamil
*  population.
*  Israel will have a very hard time doing that.
*  I know there's a lot of critics of Israel right now accusing it of committing an incipient
*  genocide.
*  There's not a lot of evidence that that's happening, in part because the Israeli military
*  is so strong that it could do so much more if what it really wanted to do was exterminate
*  the Palestinian population or force them into a choice where it's give up on Hamas or we
*  kill you.
*  They're not being super-discriminate, but they're not being indiscriminate either.
*  This speaks to something that Audrey told me, which I think is really insightful.
*  She said that Israel as a democracy is really ill-suited to do that kind of strategy.
*  A strategy of overwhelming repression.
*  That's right.
*  Because whatever you think about Israel or whatever you think about the politics, the
*  treatment of the Palestinians, there's a really essential self-conception of Israel as a democracy.
*  It really matters.
*  Even the parties on the extreme right claim to be standing up for Israeli democracy.
*  And there's a certain set of values associated with that that matter to the population.
*  There's a pretty significant level of force they can count against Palestinians.
*  But the level of force required to engage in a pure repression strategy is well beyond
*  that.
*  I mean, however bad you think this conflict is, a full-scale repression strategy would
*  be much, much, much, much worse.
*  It just seems very hard to imagine the Israeli government doing that because it would cost
*  them everything, both domestically and geopolitically.
*  That's the kind of thing that could force the U.S. to abandon Israel.
*  So if overwhelming repression doesn't typically work, what does?
*  I mean, a lot of it isn't something that external actors do.
*  Sometimes terrorist groups just implode.
*  Sometimes they get overtaken by a rival for political supremacy for one reason or another.
*  But the one that you can have some influence over, it looks like, is addressing the political
*  foundations of that terrorist group support and doing something to address the grievances
*  that fuel it or come into some kind of political agreement with the group itself.
*  Here the classic textbook example are the Good Friday Accords that ended the conflict
*  in Northern Ireland between the IRA and the British government.
*  Good Friday was a very long process.
*  I mean, getting there was a long and violent one.
*  Not quite so violent as the Israel-Palestine conflict, but it was very serious.
*  Eventually, what led to the end of that insurgency was a negotiated settlement.
*  That probably is not possible with Hamas, but there are other ways that you can change
*  the political equation so you can encourage some of these other ways that terrorist groups
*  end, like for instance being supplanted by an alternative faction.
*  But I want to put a hold because we're going to talk about the political equation.
*  But before we get to that, you end up after all this reporting when thinking about the
*  short-term military question saying, of all possible options, a focused counterterrorism
*  strategy is the best, most realistic military option available on every level, strategically,
*  morally and politically.
*  So I want to begin here with definition.
*  What is a counterterrorism strategy?
*  What distinguishes it from things like a Gazan ground invasion, et cetera?
*  No, there might be a ground component to it.
*  So I don't want to say that's not at all happening.
*  But the key difference is the question of regime change.
*  Does the Israeli military go in with the intent of putting tanks on the streets of Gaza City
*  and setting up some kind of alternative governing arrangement inside Gaza, or at least creating
*  room for one, or is the goal to, as we sort of discussed a little bit earlier, degrade
*  Hamas to the point where it will no longer be able to pose a threat, at least in the
*  immediate term, to Israeli civilians, other than the occasional sporadic rocket fire that's
*  very hard to repress.
*  And the latter option is what I come to think of as a counterterrorism operation.
*  And it has a few sort of very nitty gritty parts to it.
*  One of them is minimizing your ground invasion.
*  Israel shouldn't try to just conquer the whole territory, but rather target specifically
*  in any ground initiatives that it does Hamas leadership and the people who perpetrated
*  the October 7th attack.
*  And anyone else who might be in a position to plan or organize a similar kind of attack.
*  So that may mean ground incursions.
*  It might not.
*  It's hard for me to say without access to a lot of classified intelligence that the
*  Israelis aren't sharing with me.
*  But one thing it probably doesn't tailor significant special forces raids inside Gaza.
*  They're not omnipotent, but they can be much more discriminant in the way that they fight
*  than regular military can be.
*  It means, I mean, this is gruesome to talk about, but an extended assassination campaign
*  targeting Hamas leaders, both in Gaza and elsewhere.
*  Which they've done before.
*  Correct.
*  At the end of the second Intifada, which is in the roughly early mid 2000s, Israel
*  engaged in this concerted effort to kill anyone who it seemed was the Hamas leader.
*  At one point, this had proven so successful that Hamas didn't want to name whoever their
*  next leader was.
*  They said, we have a new leader, but we won't tell you who it is because they were so afraid
*  that that person would also be killed by an Israeli bomb or an Israeli bullet.
*  And that did seem to have an effect on Hamas' violence at that point in time.
*  Basically there are only so many people who have the skills to plan a terrorist attack.
*  There are only so many people who know how to build bombs.
*  There's only so many people who are charismatic enough to inspire effective support from underlings.
*  So if you really engage in a significant extended campaign to kill those people, it can have
*  an effect on the ability of that group to plan and execute attacks.
*  You can't end the group.
*  But here, another good example is what the US actually did do right in Afghanistan.
*  Al Qaeda is a shadow of itself right now than it was beforehand.
*  The group's not eliminated, but its capacity to pose a threat to the US homeland is dramatically
*  diminished, even with the Taliban in charge of Afghanistan.
*  You can say the same thing about ISIS after the international counterterrorism campaign
*  against them.
*  They don't really control the territory that they controlled in Iraq and Syria in the past.
*  This can work even if it can't destroy the group, but what it does, what it really is
*  is a containment strategy rather than a, you know, actually we're going to destroy in the
*  literal sense of destroying the organization.
*  Distinguishes a little bit more for me because what I'm hearing is a distinction of degrees,
*  not necessarily of kind, right?
*  This might include a ground incursion, maybe even ground invasion.
*  When the experts you spoke to say they should do this and not that, how did they draw the
*  line?
*  Well, one way to do it is duration.
*  So Dan Byman is a professor at Georgetown who studies Israeli counterterrorism strategy
*  told me that they should plan any ground operation to last for at most a matter of weeks rather
*  than months or as one Israeli source suggested up to 10 years of potential fighting in Gaza.
*  This is an order of magnitude, many orders of magnitude, probably different in terms
*  of the scale of the operation.
*  The objectives are different.
*  It's not taking out literally everything that the group can do.
*  It's about degrading its capacity to engage in violence, right?
*  So rather than destroying the institutions that Hamas has set up to function as a governing
*  entity.
*  In Gaza, you target more specifically the political and military leadership who ordered
*  the attack.
*  It's the difference between regime change and counterterrorism, right?
*  I know I'm using the word that was sort of buzzword to describe it, but I think that's
*  a really important and in many ways intuitive distinction.
*  What does counterterrorism mean?
*  And honestly, what do any of these paths mean for the hostages?
*  I think it's important not to forget their existence here, right?
*  Hamas still has, I don't know the exact number, but a very significant number.
*  Around 200.
*  Around 200 of hostages who are being held somewhere.
*  They see them as their bargaining chips.
*  How does this speak to the goal of getting them home?
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a really, really grim situation when it comes to hostages, right?
*  It's not clear to me that there is anything that Israel can give Hamas that they'd be
*  willing to pay that can get the hostages back in negotiations.
*  They're trying right now.
*  They're internationally brokered talks.
*  The US is involved.
*  Qatar is involved as a sort of international Hamas patron.
*  And those need to keep happening.
*  And they obviously are happening in a parallel track to Israel's military offensive in Gaza,
*  which is ongoing.
*  I wrote in the piece that Israel should try as best as it can to get intelligence on where
*  they are in Mount Rescue operations.
*  I also noted that the prospects of success for that are really dim in part because of
*  the tunnel stuff we were talking about for a while, right?
*  When you have this giant confusing warren underneath Gaza, it's going to be very, very,
*  very hard for Israel to figure out exactly where people are and to kind of get a special
*  forces team in position to actually bring hostages out.
*  It's logistically difficult for all kinds of different reasons.
*  So it's awful.
*  It's less awful than a full-scale ground invasion would be.
*  The reason for that is if you make it seem like Hamas is about to be destroyed fully,
*  they have every incentive to start executing hostages.
*  I can't say there's any way to stop that from happening, right?
*  This is in the nature of Hamas.
*  They specifically designed their strategy around horrific instances of violence in order
*  to terrify and incite disproportionate responses from the Israelis.
*  So it's, I mean, I don't think anyone has a good answer to this, honestly.
*  I wish I could give you a better one.
*  No one I spoke to had a solution to this that was anything like satisfying.
*  It's well reported by now that as part of the tremendous intelligence failure on the
*  Israeli side, they could see Hamas preparing for this assault.
*  They could see Hamas playing its war games and practicing its incursions.
*  And they just didn't think much of it.
*  They thought that Hamas would never attempt something like this.
*  Whatever Hamas was doing, they didn't intend to go through with it.
*  They were either trying to threaten Israel or just show that they have capabilities or
*  whatever.
*  But then they actually did do it.
*  That's what I've heard from a lot of Israelis.
*  The key mistake was thinking that we had pacified Hamas and that Hamas now had responsibilities
*  not going to do something like this and incur this kind of wrath.
*  And that's why they didn't take them seriously.
*  Yeah, I think there's two components to that.
*  The first one you just alluded to is deterrence, right?
*  So Israel has for a long time had a policy towards Hamas of what they call mowing the
*  grass, which is Hamas gets strong.
*  It builds up its military.
*  There's some kind of escalation.
*  They fight an air war, degrade Hamas's capacity to launch attacks, and the whole cycle starts
*  over.
*  euphemistic description of what really means a lots of people dying.
*  But the Israelis thought that the punishment they'd inflicted on Hamas during these repeated
*  episodes had made it such that they don't want to do what they just did.
*  And the second thing is that the government had calculated that they had other interests
*  related here that outweighed the potential terrorist threat from Hamas, which they deemed
*  limited.
*  And here I'm talking specifically about defanging the two-state solution.
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has been a very, very, very long time opponent of any kind of negotiated
*  solution with the Palestinians.
*  Netanyahu even said that this was part of his strategy at a Likud closed-door meeting.
*  He said, and I quote, anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian
*  state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas.
*  He continues, this is part of our strategy to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the
*  Palestinians in the West Bank.
*  Now this is single source.
*  We don't know if that's exactly what he said, but it's been widely reported that something
*  like that was set at the meeting.
*  And it's what they were doing.
*  Yeah, it is what they were doing.
*  Right?
*  The policy, there's a very good piece by Paul Schneider, as a reporter of the Times of Israel,
*  detailing all the different policy mechanisms that were used to pursue this policy.
*  Right?
*  And one of them was, for instance, facilitating monetary payments from Qatar to Hamas that
*  would allow them to stabilize their regime.
*  Right?
*  They had thought that this was a winning strategy for their ultimate geopolitical objective of
*  allowing Israel to continue to colonize the West Bank unimpeded.
*  So when I was preparing for this conversation, I read this piece by Lawrence Friedman, who
*  is a professor of war studies at King's College.
*  And he wrote this in the FT.
*  And this one line has just been ringing in my head, which is it, Israel is trying to
*  develop a military strategy to deal with the Hamas threat while it lacks a political strategy.
*  Something that it seems everybody told you too, is that, okay, counterterrorism operation
*  is one piece of this.
*  But as you were saying around the research in how terrorism ends, a political strategy,
*  something that saps the underlying support for the terrorist group, is the only long-term
*  solution.
*  Yes.
*  I think that's basically correct.
*  First, at this point, do you agree with Friedman that there is no dominant political strategy
*  in Israel?
*  Yeah.
*  There just isn't.
*  Up until now, there was a strategy of containing Hamas and of sort of propping it up, just
*  sort of thinking that you can deter them from launching large-scale attacks, and it's a
*  manageable problem.
*  Since that strategy has been blown up, I mean, it's been blown up since October 7th, it's
*  been a matter of weeks, and Israel has not developed an entirely new national security
*  strategy in weeks, they don't know what they're doing in the current government because they
*  are forced to reconsider every single assumption they had about how to guarantee security for
*  their own population.
*  I mean, there's just no sense of what should be done in the long term.
*  There's a sense of what we need to do immediately among Israelis, but there really is not a
*  broader strategy in place yet.
*  But is there even one on the shelf?
*  So for a very long time, I think the strategy was two-state solution, not necessarily agreed
*  on by all Israelis, but that was the sort of international working framework for what
*  everybody was eventually going to do here.
*  And obviously the details of that were very contested.
*  In recent years, that was moved away from, and that the facts on the ground be moved
*  against that, there are too many settlements, too little trust between the parties.
*  And I don't know that there was really a dominant alternative that emerged, but I do think there
*  were things like it.
*  Like something I've been thinking about is a paper written by Bezalel Smotrich, who is
*  another finance minister, pretty hard right guy.
*  But he had this big 2017 analysis of what he thought should be done.
*  And it I think is a reminder that there were other ideas floating around.
*  So he writes, quote, ending the conflict means creating and cementing the awareness practically
*  and politically that there is room for only one expression of national self-determination
*  west of the Jordan River, that of the Jewish nation.
*  Subsequently, an Arab state actualizing Arab national aspirations cannot emerge within
*  the same territory.
*  Victory involves shelving this dream, and as motivation for its fulfillment dwindles,
*  so will the terror campaign against Israel.
*  And his basic prescription in that, I mean, which I think we can fairly call apartheid,
*  is consistent repression.
*  But as a terrorism threat recedes, Israel is governing a large state that includes a
*  number of Palestinian second class citizens who have better or worse lives depending on
*  how they are acting.
*  But eventually their hope for a state is extinguished and either they leave or they settle into
*  the Israeli status quo and Israel can treat them better under those terms.
*  And that that is a form of a Jewish one state solution that I'm not saying everybody agreed
*  with.
*  But I don't know, I think if you look at what Israel was doing, it doesn't look totally
*  off the path they were on.
*  Yeah, I think people outside of Israel and the policy circles that discuss this underestimate
*  the importance of this paper.
*  They've probably never heard of it.
*  But it's really, I think, very significant in describing what the current government
*  was doing prior to October 7th.
*  Not all of Israel or even all of Netanyahu's different governments, but the current one,
*  which is, I mean, it's the most extreme right wing government in Israel's history.
*  And he's in it notably, Smutrich.
*  He's finance minister.
*  It's a big job.
*  Yeah.
*  He's finance minister.
*  His job has been structured such that he has control over the West Bank policy, basically.
*  So he could determine what was going on in that component of occupied territories.
*  And one thing that's really striking about his paper from our current vantage point is
*  that he doesn't talk about Gaza at all.
*  It's not really a problem for him.
*  He thought that Israel could secure its long term future by pacifying the West Bank.
*  And you can pacify the West Bank by depriving Palestinians of hope.
*  Now, it turns out every element of that assumption was wrong.
*  We now know because of October 7th that wasn't working.
*  But we also know that it's what he was trying to do.
*  I mean, Israel was moving towards de facto annexation of the West Bank prior to October
*  7th, which means merging Israeli domestic law with the law of the occupied territories.
*  They've been kept separate because the notion of the occupation was that it was temporary,
*  that eventually Israel would leave.
*  It wasn't annexing this land.
*  But under Smotrich and his policies towards the West Bank, we were moving closer and closer
*  towards a formal, de facto in the sense of not announced, but formal integration of the
*  laws and formal annexation of the West Bank.
*  But what choice was there except for that?
*  I mean, I think when people think of the settlements, I mean, just picture in your head what the
*  number is you think live in the settlements in the West Bank, the implication of the term
*  is that it's modest.
*  That's 700,000 people.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  That's significant.
*  I mean, the idea that Israel's not governing, I mean, they're Israeli citizens, obviously.
*  The idea that Israel's not governing them and thus the territory in which they live,
*  a portion of its population that significant is absurd.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's an important caveat there, which is that a lot of the settlements and
*  the large population of them live just on the border with Israel proper and really in
*  areas near Jerusalem.
*  They're functionally suburbs of Jerusalem.
*  And so in most of the peace proposals or the maps that people have drawn up, a lot of those
*  get annexed to Israel in exchange for territorial swaps that are currently Israeli territories
*  going to a Palestinian territory.
*  So those settlements are less of a problem and they are the main population center.
*  That being said, you're right on the basics of the situation.
*  I mean, they're scattered all around and they're scattered all around, by the way, by design.
*  The point of the placement of a lot of these settlements is to cut off Palestinian communities
*  from each other.
*  And by that, I don't just mean like it's between them.
*  I mean, because of what Israel has to do to secure settlers who might otherwise be vulnerable
*  to attacks from Palestinian militant groups, you end up creating the situation where it's
*  extremely difficult for Palestinians to get around for their communities to be connected.
*  I mean, in one place that I went to outside of Jerusalem, there is one home, part of a
*  Palestinian town.
*  It's a little bit off from the town center, but that puts it directly adjacent to an Israeli
*  settlement.
*  Now, the settlers didn't want Palestinians coming into their land.
*  So what did the Israeli military do?
*  They built a cage around this house and they built a walkway that's all fenced in that
*  connects the house to the village that it's nominally a part of.
*  So the people who live there have to walk by settlers who are on the outside of what's
*  essentially their home is a prison and sees them walking by to get into the town.
*  It's hard to overstate how disruptive the settlement enterprise is for Palestinians.
*  The political barrier to dismantling all of this is figuring out how to get those people
*  out of there, not logistically.
*  That's not actually that difficult.
*  It's surmounting the political opposition to the trauma that it would cause.
*  The disengagement of Gaza was very difficult for Israelis to begin with.
*  I think the biggest difference in the politics of this issue over the past 20 years is the
*  number of people who now believe the two-state solution is dead.
*  There are no end of pieces in places like foreign affairs, right, where this would not
*  have really been sayable 20 years ago.
*  For the exact reason you just said, the number of settlers, the number of people you'd have
*  to pull back into Israel, the amount of political power they have, how politically impossible
*  that looks, there is no two-state solution because even before you get to all these other
*  questions like right of return and a lot of other things that I think often get ignored
*  in how hard a significant settlement would be, you cannot unwind the settlement growth
*  of the past 20 years.
*  And if you can't unwind that, there is no land swap that would create a Palestinian
*  state that makes any sense.
*  Now, you're more optimistic on this, but I'd like to hear why, because I actually find
*  that quite convincing.
*  Optimistic is the wrong word, right?
*  It's more that as hard as it seems to get to a two-state solution from where we are
*  right now, it's that all of the alternatives are even less viable.
*  And you have to go somewhere.
*  Stasis is not possible.
*  I think that's one lesson of October 7th.
*  As horrible as it is, we now know that Israel trying to maintain the kind of relationship
*  it has with Palestinians, both in Gaza and the West Bank, is not durable in the long
*  run.
*  There will continue to be unpredictable spurts of violence, and that will cause something
*  to change.
*  The question is, what is it going to change towards?
*  But I think it is a conceptual mistake that is very common among people who study any
*  kind of policy to believe that a problem will ultimately end in a solution.
*  Sure.
*  Right?
*  That there will be some answer that answer the problem.
*  But you can have much more extended misery than I think people tend to believe in policy
*  circles.
*  And I think that's one of the very complicated muddling throughs.
*  And so the place I have moved to is I in some ways think the whole conversation about one
*  state and two state has become weirdly, it's like too far, right?
*  You need precursors to just better than this.
*  No, I think that's right.
*  So when you talk to people about what are the strategies that could begin to shift the
*  political equilibrium of the conflict, in a tactical and specific way, what did they
*  say?
*  And end it all.
*  But what could you do incrementally, slowly, year by year that might be trust building
*  that might begin to pry open doors just a little bit that feel closed now?
*  Yeah, look, I think it's important to understand that the occupation of the West Bank, which
*  is where most of these changes would happen, is an immensely complicated legal, political
*  and military institution.
*  It depends on lots of different policies to expand.
*  And you can start changing some of them.
*  You can start rolling some of them back to make life better for ordinary Palestinians,
*  which is I think really the key to this political situation is to show Palestinians that there's
*  a way forward that doesn't involve violence.
*  So like what?
*  What could you roll back?
*  So one would be land use policies.
*  A lot of what Israel does right now in the area is to change land regulations such that
*  it's easy for settlements or at least easier for settlers to take over a different Palestinian
*  land.
*  And there are a number of specific things, even see some that are related to national
*  park services that are used as basically pre-tax to grab Palestinian land.
*  Another one would be cutting down or dismantling some of the checkpoints that dot the West
*  Bank and that make it hard for Palestinians to move around from one place to another.
*  Cutting down on those would substantially improve the Palestinian economy.
*  A third would be a cash investment.
*  This is a policy that the former Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad pursued,
*  which is a policy of economic development.
*  Didn't work out for a variety of reasons.
*  It's not really Fayyad's fault in my view.
*  It's a fault of the sclerotic Palestinian political organization and an Israeli government
*  that really wasn't very interested in making Palestinian lives a lot better.
*  That's something international donors could help change.
*  There's already a lot of money going in.
*  There are better ways to organize that funding.
*  We can go through dozens of different specific, very nitty gritty specific policies.
*  Or another one, start doing a better job at preventing provocations from right-wing Israelis
*  on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, like going in, storming into Al Aqsa Mosque and praying
*  ostentatiously, claiming the land, claiming the Temple Mount and the mosque for Jews.
*  That kind of thing has a tendency to really explode tensions between the two groups.
*  One reason Hamas called the operation Al Aqsa Flood.
*  Correct.
*  Israel does so much right now that enables the growth of settlements and that really
*  makes life horrible and anger-inducing for a lot of ordinary Palestinians.
*  But one other thing that October 7th has done is discredit Benjamin Netanyahu among the
*  Israeli public.
*  I mean, if you look at every piece of polling data right now on his approval rating, on
*  a hypothetical election, I mean, his numbers have collapsed because Israelis very rightly
*  blame him for what happened.
*  They blame his strategy, his approach to Israeli security for what happened.
*  So for the first time in a long time, Israel has been really caught in this political log
*  jam.
*  And for the first time in a long time, it seems as if there could be something new politically
*  that could happen that could actually have a durable base and a large one among the Israeli
*  population.
*  This speaks to, I think, another very dominant view right now in Israel, which was something
*  people were saying before this, which has given us credibility after the attacks, which
*  is that Netanyahu and his government were weakening Israel by dividing Israel so profoundly
*  internally over things like the judicial reforms, that the effort to change the character of
*  Israel as a state was something that made it impossible for Israel to keep focus on
*  its actual threats.
*  And I'm curious how you rate where that anger sits now and what that may or may not make
*  possible.
*  I mean, it's still pretty profound.
*  There are these videos, I don't know if you've seen them.
*  Have you ever of government ministers getting yelled at by ordinary Israelis?
*  Yeah, I have.
*  Yeah.
*  So they get screamed at by ordinary Israelis who blame them for what happened.
*  It's easy to forget now, given how different the world seems after Hamas's attack, but
*  Israel had been experiencing the largest protests of its entire history for most of this year
*  against the judicial reform.
*  This was an issue, an attempt really to alter the foundation of Israeli democracy that was
*  vastly unpopular and significantly undercut trust in the government.
*  Netanyahu's approval ratings were bad before the worst terrorist attack in Israeli history
*  happened under his watch.
*  He's currently on trial on charges related to corruption, some of which are quite serious.
*  There's no trust from the Israeli political mainstream.
*  He has a hard core of supporters, but people don't believe him to be the guarantor of their
*  security or of their country's prosperity or political future that they thought he once
*  was.
*  So that creates a tremendous opening for there to be some kind of political alternative.
*  Now what that alternative looks like, not quite as obvious.
*  Right now, the polling suggests that Betty Gantz, who has joined an emergency coalition
*  with Netanyahu, is the primary beneficiary of public dissent.
*  This makes sense.
*  Gantz is sort of a centrist, center-right type figure, former general, very hawkish on the
*  Palestinian conflict.
*  Not on settlements though.
*  He's hawkish.
*  This is another sort of poorly understood dividing line outside of Israel.
*  The people who are most hardcore about the settlements are not always the people who
*  are most hardcore about responding to terrorist attacks with force.
*  There's a correlation there, but they can be delinked.
*  So Gantz is very, very aggressive when it comes to military attacks, but he is not ideologically
*  committed to settlements.
*  And there's another person aligned with him, Gadi Eisencote, former chief of staff of the
*  IDF, who probably would be even more inclined, if given a position of power, to wind down
*  or at least roll back some of what has been done under Netanyahu to entrench Israeli control
*  over the West Bank.
*  So if he's defense minister, let's say we could see a very, very different West Bank
*  policy in the event that politics change as much as polls suggest they're going to.
*  And then always our final question.
*  What are three books you'd recommend to the audience?
*  So I want to start with A High Price, which is Dan Byman's history of Israeli counterterrorism
*  policy.
*  It's a book that's been updated now and it's published about 10 years ago or so.
*  But to my mind, it's one of the best serious interrogations of what Israel does or what
*  its playbook is for dealing with terrorist groups, where it works and where it doesn't.
*  I learned a lot from reading Dan's book.
*  A second book I'd recommend is the Selected Works of Edward Said, the famous Palestinian-American
*  intellectual.
*  There's a lot in there that's not related to the conflict, but Said is one of the most
*  articulate exponents ever to live of the Palestinian cause.
*  And if you want to understand where Palestinians are coming from and how they feel about Israeli
*  occupation, it's hard to do better than going to Said's work.
*  And the third book I'd recommend, since we spent so much time talking about the West
*  Bank, is a book by an Israeli journalist named Gershwin Gorenberg called The External Empire.
*  And I love Gorenberg's book because he really traces the history of how settlements emerged,
*  the ways in which Israeli policy facilitated their development, and the ways in which Israeli
*  governments were taken by surprise by what they had allowed to happen, and how settlers
*  themselves pioneered this fundamental transformation to the conflict that was not necessarily,
*  although at times it seemed like it was, part of Israeli strategic design.
*  It's a really, I think, an essential insight into how things got to the point where they're
*  at right now.
