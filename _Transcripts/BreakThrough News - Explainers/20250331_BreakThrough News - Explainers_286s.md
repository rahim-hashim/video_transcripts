# Mahmoud Khalil is Targeted with an Anti-Communist, McCarthyite Law
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs)
*  When Mahmoud Khalil was abducted, he was never actually charged with a crime. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=0.0s)]
*  Since then, the Trump administration has been scrambling to find a law that would allow [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=4.72s)]
*  them to deport him without him ever having committed a crime. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=8.92s)]
*  And the one they found is a draconian, anti-communist law from the Cold War. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=12.6s)]
*  It's called the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, and it was a law the government [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=17.32s)]
*  used to deport anyone that basically criticized the government under the guise that they were [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=22.2s)]
*  communists. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=26.76s)]
*  The Trump administration, in this period, called the McCarthyite period, or the second [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=28.36s)]
*  Red Scare, which is distinct from the first Red Scare in the 1910s, saw thousands of people [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=31.24s)]
*  politically persecuted and tarred as communists, fired from their jobs, and blacklisted even [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=36.36s)]
*  if they were just involved in things like the civil rights movement or unions. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=41.56s)]
*  The Trump administration is now trying to use this law to say that it actually gives [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  the government the right to deport Mahmoud, one of the leaders of the Columbia University [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=48.86s)]
*  Gaza Solidarity Encampment, not even for being a communist, but because he is, and this is [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  a direct quote, adversarial to the foreign policy and national security interests of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=58.12s)]
*  the United States of America, basically saying the quiet part out loud that Mahmoud's crime [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=63.44s)]
*  is not supporting U.S. imperial interests. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  What's crazy about the Trump administration using this law against Mahmoud is that it's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=71.12s)]
*  obvious what history they're harking back on. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=75.6s)]
*  If you know anything about the Red Scare, you'll know this was one of the most repressive [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=78.12s)]
*  periods in this country. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  It was a manufactured mass hysteria over the supposed communist infiltration of society. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=83.34s)]
*  People were told that the Soviet Union was secretly plotting to install communist agents [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=88.86s)]
*  in positions of power across America to take it down from the inside. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=93.06s)]
*  What followed was an anti-communist crusade that affected every sector of society. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=97.7s)]
*  The government made it illegal to be a member of a communist party, work to drive communists [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=102.38s)]
*  out of labor unions, Hollywood, and out of the country altogether. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=106.66s)]
*  Even though they said they were only targeting communists, it became very clear very quickly [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=110.94s)]
*  that this actually meant targeting anyone who was involved in anything vaguely progressive, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=115.58s)]
*  from those opposing the Jim Crow Apartheid system in the South to radicals in labor unions [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=120.42s)]
*  or anti-war activists. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=124.98s)]
*  So-called loyalty programs were enacted where government workers had to take an anti-communist [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=127.7s)]
*  oath or lose their job. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=131.9s)]
*  The Taft-Hartley Act established a similar oath for union officials. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=134.22s)]
*  Thousands of people were investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=137.74s)]
*  for suspected communist sympathies and were fired or resigned because of its investigations. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=141.74s)]
*  One of the most notorious campaigns was the campaign against Hollywood, where hundreds [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=147.22s)]
*  of actors, writers, and directors were made to testify before the committee and disclose [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=151.3s)]
*  their political affiliations. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  Anyone who refused or was accused of being a communist was blacklisted, which basically [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  ended their careers. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  You can see the similarities here. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=164.24s)]
*  The Trump administration and pro-Israel forces have spent years, even decades, trying to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=166.12s)]
*  cast the growing pro-Palestine sentiment in the United States as anti-Semitic. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=171.04s)]
*  They accuse people who support a movement for peace and human rights of being terrorists [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  without any evidence and try to criminalize perfectly legal political activity. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  Just like the accusations of communism during the Red Scare, these accusations are obviously [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=185.08s)]
*  intended to smear the reputation of the accused and have no basis in reality. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=189.56s)]
*  But the point of the Red Scare, much like this latest crackdown on pro-Palestine speech, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=194.32s)]
*  was never about an actual communist plot to infiltrate America. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=198.66s)]
*  The point of the Red Scare was to silence people, crush dissent, and force a whole population [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=202.48s)]
*  to get on board with the Cold War as the cornerstone of US foreign policy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  But the thing to remember about the Red Scare isn't that it was scary. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=212.32s)]
*  It's that it failed. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  The Red Scare ultimately failed at crushing dissent because the guy who was leading it, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=217.6s)]
*  Senator Joseph McCarthy, basically went way too far in who he accused of being a communist. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=222.2s)]
*  In 1954, McCarthy accused the US Army of harboring communists and began calling members of the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=228.2s)]
*  military to testify before Congress. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=233.48s)]
*  Millions of people watched him make completely baseless accusations and bully witnesses on [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=236.44s)]
*  TV, which destroyed the credibility of the Red Scare as a whole. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=240.76s)]
*  The abduction of Mahmoud Khalil and the firing and expulsion of Grant Minor, who was himself [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=244.98s)]
*  obviously have nothing to do with anti-Semitism. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=251.28s)]
*  The government hasn't presented a single shred of evidence that Mahmoud supports terrorism [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=254.16s)]
*  either. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=258.08s)]
*  They thought that by attacking these two, they would scare the rest of the movement [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=259.08s)]
*  into silence, but instead, it completely backfired. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=262.84s)]
*  The petition to free Mahmoud got over 3 million signatures in less than a week and triggered [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=267.46s)]
*  mass protests around the country. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=272.3s)]
*  Ironically, by targeting Mahmoud and Grant, the pro-Israel side have basically exposed [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=274.6s)]
*  how hollow and fake their accusations against the Palestine movement really are. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUNqIT6RSs&t=280.48s)]
