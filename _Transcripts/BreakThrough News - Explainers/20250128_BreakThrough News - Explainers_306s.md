# Report: Billionaires Now Making Up To $100 Million a Day
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM)
*  A shocking new report from Oxfam exposes just how bad the world's billionaire problem is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=0.0s)]
*  The 97-page report, aptly titled Takers Not Makers, explains how billionaires are actually [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=5.36s)]
*  becoming more powerful, not less. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=10.96s)]
*  The report found that in the last year, the world's 2,769 billionaires increased their [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=13.76s)]
*  wealth by $2 trillion, three times faster than the year before. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=19.44s)]
*  That means the average billionaire is making $2 million a day, while the richest 10 billionaires [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=24.28s)]
*  are making $100 million a day. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=29.4s)]
*  To put that in perspective, if you earned $1,000 a day every single day for 315,000 [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=31.64s)]
*  years, which would take you back to the dawn of homo sapiens as a species, you still wouldn't [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=38.64s)]
*  be as wealthy as people like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=45.16s)]
*  Even if every single billionaire lost 99% of their wealth, every single one of them, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=49.36s)]
*  with the exception of a few, would still be wealthier than 99% of people in America. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=55.56s)]
*  Collectively, the billionaire class, which is, again, less than 3,000 people, has a net [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=61.52s)]
*  worth of $15 trillion, meaning together they're worth more than every single country on Earth [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  except the United States and China. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  The report also notes that even though billionaire wealth is skyrocketing, the number of people [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=75.88s)]
*  in the world living in poverty hasn't changed since 1990. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Right now, 44% of humanity lives below the poverty line, meaning they make less than [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=84.2s)]
*  $6.85 a day. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=89.28s)]
*  If you take out China's poverty reduction, which has been one of the main drivers of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=91.76s)]
*  poverty reduction in the last few decades, lifting over 800 million people out of poverty [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=95.5s)]
*  since 1979, the global poverty rate has actually increased. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=100.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, if current trends continue, Oxfam predicts that we'll have 5 trillionaires [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=104.88s)]
*  within a decade. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=110.16s)]
*  The report also calculates that 36% of all billionaire wealth is inherited. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=111.4s)]
*  In fact, every single billionaire under the age of 30 inherited their wealth. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  18% of billionaire wealth, according to this report, comes from monopoly power. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=121.0s)]
*  This refers to companies like Amazon that control so much market share they can set [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=125.94000000000001s)]
*  industry prices, unilaterally lower wages, and stifle innovation without any competition [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=130.4s)]
*  from other companies. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=136.16s)]
*  Another 6% of billionaire wealth comes from cronyism, meaning corrupt state officials [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=137.64s)]
*  that use their positions to enrich themselves. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=141.55999999999997s)]
*  In total, Oxfam estimates that 60% of billionaire wealth comes from these illegitimate sources [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=144.17999999999998s)]
*  and led the authors to conclude that billionaire wealth is, quote, largely unmerited. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  This might actually be the most important part of the report, because how many people [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=154.73999999999998s)]
*  do we know that talk about wanting to be millionaires or billionaires? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=158.56s)]
*  On the internet, you can find all kinds of videos that talk about how you can get rich [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=162.29999999999998s)]
*  or how you can get a billionaire mindset, and they almost always say the only difference [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=166.66s)]
*  between you and the billionaires is that the billionaires work harder than you. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=170.94s)]
*  But according to this report, most billionaires don't work for their money at all. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=174.82s)]
*  They steal it or they just get it from their parents. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=178.74s)]
*  In fact, you actually have a far greater chance of getting struck by lightning or dying in [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=181.74s)]
*  a plane crash than you do of becoming a billionaire, literally by thousands of times. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=186.18s)]
*  The only reason billionaires tell you that you can become a billionaire is so you stay [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=191.7s)]
*  in your place instead of questioning the role of billionaires in society. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=196.17999999999998s)]
*  If people realized that one of the most common ways people get this rich is by cheating or [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=200.48s)]
*  inheriting from your parents, you'd realize these people aren't the geniuses they make [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=205.1s)]
*  themselves out to be. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  They're not innovators, and they're not heroes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=210.45999999999998s)]
*  If they cared about you or I at all, they would have shown it by now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  They would have improved wages and living standards. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  They would have paid their fair share in taxes like the rest of us instead of hoarding it [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=220.46s)]
*  all for themselves. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=224.46s)]
*  But that's the point. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=225.46s)]
*  No amount of honest, hard work makes you that rich. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=227.62s)]
*  The only way to get that rich is to drain the wealth of the rest of society. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=231.16s)]
*  And what are you called in biology when you have an organism that drains the lifeblood [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=236.02s)]
*  of a larger host? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=239.74s)]
*  The newly inaugurated Trump administration is basically a prototype of what a global [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=241.02s)]
*  dictatorship of billionaires could look like. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=245.5s)]
*  One of the top priorities of this administration, which counts 13 billionaires and $483 billion [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=248.42s)]
*  in net worth among its ranks, is actually to cut taxes on the billionaire class even [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=254.98s)]
*  further and destroy whatever is left of the public safety net. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=259.09999999999997s)]
*  But what's truly incredible about this is this billionaire-run administration is trying [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=263.02s)]
*  to convince us that the reason we're struggling isn't because of billionaires and corporations [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=268.08s)]
*  hoarding wealth. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=273.3s)]
*  It's because of immigrants. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=274.3s)]
*  Just think about what's being said here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=276.38s)]
*  A group of billionaires wants you to think that they're not your enemy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=278.46s)]
*  It's the roofer coming from Guatemala that's your enemy. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=282.98s)]
*  A group of billionaires wants you to think that they're not your enemy. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=286.02s)]
*  It's the Haitian family fleeing a US-backed dictatorship with nothing but the clothes [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=291.0s)]
*  on their backs that's your enemy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=295.76s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  When you really think about it, that's exactly what you'd expect a bunch of billionaires [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=299.76s)]
*  to tell you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdBXBgwXhM&t=304.8s)]
