# Meet the Israeli Religious Extremists That Are Trying To Bring About The End Times
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI)
*  There's a movement in Israel that wants to bring about the end of the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=0.0s)]
*  It's called the Temple Movement, and it's crucial to understanding the ultra-right-wing in Israel. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=3.36s)]
*  A few weeks ago, a group of Palestine Solidarity activists were protesting Israeli National Security Minister [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Itamar Ben-Gavir's visit to Brooklyn. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  He was visiting the international headquarters of the Chabad Lubavitch Movement, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=15.76s)]
*  which is one of the largest ultra-orthodox movements in the world. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=19.52s)]
*  Most of the discussion of Ben-Gavir's visit focused on the attack against the pro-Palestine protesters, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=22.72s)]
*  but what completely flew under the radar was what Itamar was even doing there to begin with. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=27.76s)]
*  A video of Itamar's speech to the Chabad congregation showed Itamar jumping around and chanting [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  that Israel will build a Jewish temple on top of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=38.0s)]
*  the current location of one of the holiest sites in Islam, Al Aqsa Mosque. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=42.0s)]
*  Chabad, the city of Jerusalem. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Itamar is part of a wider constellation of ultra-right pro-Israel groups called the Temple Movement [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=53.52s)]
*  that want to destroy Al Aqsa Mosque and replace it with a Jewish temple, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=58.24s)]
*  which some extremists in the Jewish community believe will fulfill end-times prophecy and bring back the Messiah. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=61.92s)]
*  In practice, this is essentially a call for the total extermination of the Palestinian people [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=67.68s)]
*  because Al Aqsa is an absolute red line for them, and Muslims across the world for that matter. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=72.64s)]
*  This messianic movement, which used to be completely fringe, is now at the heart of the Israeli right-wing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=77.36s)]
*  You may have seen videos circulating recently on Israeli social media of Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=83.28s)]
*  being blown up and replaced with a Jewish temple. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=88.8s)]
*  This movement is being funded by some of the most genocidal factions in Israel [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=91.6s)]
*  and has been gaining so much momentum that its proponents now occupy positions in the current government. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=95.2s)]
*  Here's what you need to know. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=100.48s)]
*  The story of the Jewish Temple according to the Tanakh is that when the Jews escaped Egypt [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=101.84s)]
*  and arrived in Palestine, which was known as Canaan at the time, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=106.4s)]
*  they killed all the inhabitants of Canaan for being polytheists [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=109.92s)]
*  and built a temple to the one god they believed in in what is today Jerusalem. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=113.04s)]
*  The Babylonians destroyed the temple and the Jews rebuilt it on the same spot, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=117.36s)]
*  only for the Romans to destroy it a second time, which led to the Jews being scattered across the world. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=121.36s)]
*  According to some Jews, when Jews build a third temple on the same spot, the Messiah will return. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  The only problem with this is that they also believe that the first and second temples [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=132.16s)]
*  were built on the temple mount where Al Aqsa is. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=135.84s)]
*  The goal of the temple movement, therefore, has been to destroy Al Aqsa. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=138.24s)]
*  The most important group in this movement is the Temple Institute, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=141.84s)]
*  and it's an organization dedicated entirely to building the third temple by hand [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=144.88s)]
*  and removing the abomination, meaning Al Aqsa in the Dome of the Rock. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=148.8s)]
*  They've spent years preparing ritual objects to be used when the third temple is built, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  things like robes for priests, a 42 kilogram golden menorah, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=156.8s)]
*  animals for ritual sacrifices, and of course blueprints and 3D models of the temple itself. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=160.88s)]
*  They produce ads and social media videos where Jews in Israel wake up one day with a fully [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=166.56s)]
*  completed Jewish temple in Al Aqsa's place and call on the Jewish people to make the dream a reality. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=171.28s)]
*  Their YouTube channel is full of lectures interpreting Jewish scripture [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=177.28s)]
*  through the lens of this fascist ideology. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=180.96s)]
*  To give you an idea of how this group thinks, let's start by looking at their founder, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=183.36s)]
*  a rabbi named Yisrael Ariel. Yisrael Ariel was a member of the Israeli Koch Party, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=187.28s)]
*  which was a party that advocated the total removal of Palestinians from Palestine. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=192.96s)]
*  Part of its platform was the banning of Muslims from the Temple Mount, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=197.04s)]
*  and the Israeli Koch Party was so racist and violent that it was actually banned in Israel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=200.4s)]
*  The Koch Party's founder was a rabbi from Brooklyn named Mer Kahana, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=206.0s)]
*  the founder of a New York-based ultra-nationalist paramilitary group called the Jewish Defense League [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=209.68s)]
*  that would attack and, in some cases, murder anyone they considered enemies of the Jewish people, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=214.4s)]
*  i.e. anti-Zionists and random Arabs. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=219.6s)]
*  The JDL is widely believed to have been behind the bombing and murder of Arab-American rights [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=222.88s)]
*  activist Alex Oda, and the JDL also plotted to assassinate a Lebanese-American member of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=240.16s)]
*  Congress and blow up a nearby mosque. The JDL is a designated terrorist organization [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=245.12s)]
*  in the United States and Canada, but despite this, Kahana is not only celebrated by many Israelis, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=250.24s)]
*  his thinking has been transformed into an ideology known as Kahanism, and the guy who [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=256.0s)]
*  founded the Temple Institute is a Kahanist and was an elected member of Kahana's fascist party. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=260.96s)]
*  As soon as the Temple Institute's founder, Yisrael Ariel, left Israeli parliament, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  he was arrested in a plot to take over the Temple Mount by force by carving a tunnel underneath it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=271.52s)]
*  In 2015, Ariel led a group of Orthodox rabbis in penning a message of support for 10 Israeli men [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=277.04s)]
*  who were banned from going into the West Bank after they committed an arson attack against [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=283.44s)]
*  a Palestinian family, killing three people, including 18-month-old Ali Dawaabshah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  Here's a video of the men from this group taunting Ali's grandmother outside of a courthouse. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=293.12s)]
*  The Temple Institute founder Yisrael Ariel wrote as the spokesman of these rabbis that the men who [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=297.36s)]
*  burned the Dawaabshah family alive were, quote, praiseworthy and an inspiration to rabbinical [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=308.72s)]
*  judges and to all the faithful of Israel. By far the most prominent member of the Institute [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=314.32s)]
*  was Rabbi Chaim Richmond. He likes to say that the Temple movement isn't political, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=319.04s)]
*  that it's just a spiritual movement. But listen to him for yourself and tell me if he's someone [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=323.52s)]
*  who sounds apolitical to you. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=327.84s)]
*  The Temple Institute is just the main group, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=353.44s)]
*  but there's a litany of similar groups like the Temple Mount Faithful, the Movement for Temple [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=382.0s)]
*  Renewal, Ha'iv Akayim, Har Habayit Shalanu, Center for the Study of the History of the Temple in [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=386.16s)]
*  Jerusalem, the Center for Temple Studies at Mitzvah, Women for the Temple, I could go on and on. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=392.08s)]
*  And while they all share similar goals, their motivations are different. Some of these groups [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=397.44s)]
*  are religious, while some are just nationalists. Some defy Israeli law while others try to work [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=402.0s)]
*  within it. And like I said earlier, this movement has had a resurgence in the last 10 years or so [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=406.88s)]
*  and are now taking up positions in the Israeli government. A big reason for this resurgence is [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=411.92s)]
*  that Temple movement groups are being funded by the Kaanis and are deeply tied with the Israeli [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=416.88s)]
*  settler movement, which is itself motivated by religious extremism in many cases. For example, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=421.6s)]
*  one of the largest groups the Kaanis has been funding is Lehava, a Jewish supremacist group [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=427.36s)]
*  whose goal is to stop marriages between Jews and non-Jews. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=432.48s)]
*  The founder of this group called for the destruction of the Dome of the Rock on Jerusalem Day, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=441.92s)]
*  posting an image of the structure being bulldozed by a crane. In fact, due to how controversial [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=459.12s)]
*  these messianic ideas are, the Israeli government will often condemn these groups to the international [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=464.32s)]
*  community, but investigations have shown that they're also quietly funding these groups. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=468.88s)]
*  One investigation found that the government was not only giving money to the Temple Institute, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=473.52s)]
*  they also found that the government was allowing women to opt out of Israel's compulsory military [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=477.44s)]
*  service if they worked for the Institute. They've also been trying for years to take over the Likud [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=482.08s)]
*  party, the party of Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=487.36s)]
*  I'm looking, I don't know who I'm looking straight at, I'm looking straight at this camera. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=498.88s)]
*  I am a Talmud of Rabbi Meir Kahana. I was, I am, I always will be. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=504.96s)]
*  Recent and current Israeli government officials who have expressed support for an Israeli takeover [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=514.24s)]
*  of the Temple Mount include current Israeli ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hoteveli, former [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=518.16s)]
*  Minister of Agriculture Yuri Ariel, former Knesset member and deputy defense minister [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=523.6s)]
*  Rabbi Eli Ben-Dahan, the current Minister of Transportation Mary Ragev, the notoriously [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=528.56s)]
*  racist former Justice Minister Ayelet Shackid, the current Deputy Prime Minister Yariv Levine, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=534.2399999999999s)]
*  Yuli Edelstein, the former Minister of Health, former Knesset members Yehuda Glick and Moshe [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=540.0s)]
*  Feiglin, and current Knesset members Yitzhak Pinterest and of course Itamar Ben-Ghivir. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  It was no accident that Chabad Lubavitch invited him to their headquarters. Itamar Ben-Ghivir is [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=550.7199999999999s)]
*  the face of the Kahana's funded Jewish power party and the face of the Temple movement in Israeli [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=556.0s)]
*  politics. He routinely tries to provoke conflict by going up to the Temple Mount with Jewish [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=560.88s)]
*  ultra-nationalist groups hoping to spark a war. Itamar himself is probably the most famous [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=566.08s)]
*  disciple of Meir Kahana and famously kept a framed picture of Kahana's mass shooter Baruch Goldstein, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=571.12s)]
*  who shot and killed 29 Palestinians in the Ibrahimi Mosque shooting in his office. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=577.28s)]
*  The way the Chabad Lubavitch attack was framed by politicians tried to make it out like the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=583.28s)]
*  pro-Palestine protesters were just randomly attacking a synagogue. But Chabad Lubavitch [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=587.68s)]
*  itself is part of the Third Temple movement, especially outside of Israel. Their yellow flag [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=592.9599999999999s)]
*  with the crown on it has been used as a banner of the ultra-right, being flown in Gaza by IDF [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=598.4s)]
*  soldiers and at ultra-right wing rallies like the rally where Israelis protested for the right of [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=603.6s)]
*  Israeli soldiers to rape Palestinian prisoners. Their website talks openly about the need for a [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=609.36s)]
*  Third Temple and their leader, Rabbi Mendel Schneerson, more commonly known as the Rebbe, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  whose poster you've probably seen if you live in New York, is an adherent of the racist Kahanaist [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=619.36s)]
*  ideology. He once wrote, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=624.08s)]
*  When Mayor Kahana died, Mendel Schneerson called Kahana one of the greatest Jewish leaders in [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=639.92s)]
*  history. He also said that Kahana's son was doing his father's holy work, referring to the fact that [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=645.2s)]
*  Kahana's son Baruch and his brother Nachman have been chosen as priests to serve in the Third Temple. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=650.96s)]
*  Here they are, being fitted for garments made by the Temple Institute and being measured for them [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=657.44s)]
*  by Yehuda Glick, who we talked about earlier. Chabad Lubavitch is considered so extreme they've [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=661.92s)]
*  been denounced by several other sects of ultra-orthodox Judaism. It's worth noting that Trump's new [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=667.28s)]
*  anti-Semitism czar is also a rabbi from Chabad Lubavitch. You're probably reaching the part of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=672.4s)]
*  the video where you're like, okay, we get it, but why should we care about all this? Well, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7TRhHXuEI&t=677.68s)]
