Video Description: The tariff vs free trade debate is a false choice for workers.
The US had periods of high tariffs and periods of “free trade” but neither benefited workers.
BT’s Kei Pritsker explains why the question is the power imbalance between workers and capital, not trade policy.

# Tariffs Won’t Save Workers. Neither Will Free Trade.
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY)
*  Trump just launched a full-blown trade war with China. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=0.0s)]
*  He's trying to make this out to be a populist move to bring manufacturing back to the United [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=2.84s)]
*  States to create jobs for American workers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=7.36s)]
*  But a trade war isn't going to improve the living conditions of American workers. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=10.08s)]
*  In fact, the whole free trade vs. tariff debate is a false dichotomy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Here's what you need to know. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=19.32s)]
*  A tariff is basically a tax on imports. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=21.28s)]
*  Anyone that imports something into the country will pay a percentage of the total value of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=23.96s)]
*  to the federal government. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=28.64s)]
*  So Apple, for example, who makes their phones in China and then imports them into the United [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=30.2s)]
*  States, will now have to pay a tax on those phones when they cross the U.S. border and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=34.36s)]
*  the cost of a phone could go up a few hundred dollars. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  The Trump administration argues that making foreign goods artificially more expensive [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=41.96s)]
*  than domestic goods will compel American workers to buy American-made products and persuade [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=45.36s)]
*  companies to relocate their factories to the United States, thus bringing manufacturing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=50.72s)]
*  jobs back home. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=55.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, free traders argue that tariffs will just end up making everything more expensive [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  for workers, erasing the benefits that any new jobs would bring. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  There's a kernel of truth to both sides of the debate, but what no one's saying is that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=65.6s)]
*  the free trade vs. tariff debate is fundamentally a false choice for workers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=69.64s)]
*  The United States has had periods where they've employed high tariffs and periods where it's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=74.4s)]
*  lowered trade barriers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=78.32s)]
*  But no matter what trade regime the U.S. implements, that's not what determines the conditions [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=80.16s)]
*  of life for the working class. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=84.52s)]
*  You'll hear Trump reference the 1890s as a golden age that he wants to get back to, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=86.16s)]
*  a period where the United States had an average tariff rate of 30%. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=91.4s)]
*  What's funny about this is that the period he's referring to, which is historically [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=94.76s)]
*  known as the Gilded Age, is a period where America was basically run by a handful of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=99.12s)]
*  unbelievably rich capitalists, the robber barons who were U.S.-based manufacturers. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  This period Trump is saying he wants to emulate was characterized by some of the worst exploitation [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=109.48s)]
*  of the American working class in history. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=114.38s)]
*  We're talking sweatshops, child labor, six-day work weeks with 12 and 14 hour workdays, getting [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=116.42s)]
*  paid pennies per hour, workplace deaths, lost limbs, all of that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=122.89999999999999s)]
*  In other words, the period Trump wants to go back to was only a golden age for monopolists [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=128.26s)]
*  and oligarchs, people like John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and Andrew Mellon, who built [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=133.46s)]
*  their massive fortunes by working American workers to death. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=138.9s)]
*  That's why it was called the Gilded Age, because it was a period of misery that was [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=143.22s)]
*  only covered by a thin layer of gold. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=146.5s)]
*  The other thing that's really important to point out is that this is basically a regressive [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=148.94s)]
*  tax redistribution scheme. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=152.73999999999998s)]
*  In the late 1800s, as Trump likes to point out, there was no income tax, and the government [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=154.82s)]
*  financed itself solely on tariffs. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=159.66s)]
*  One of the big appeals that Trump is making is that by implementing tariffs again, we [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=162.5s)]
*  can abolish the income tax. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=166.28s)]
*  This might sound really appealing, but what it would actually do, and what it did in the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=168.48s)]
*  1800s, was shift the burden of financing the government on the working class. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=172.32s)]
*  By contrast, the income tax is a progressive tax, meaning the more income you make, the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  higher percentage of your income you pay in income taxes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  In other words, rich people bear a larger share of the income tax than poor people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=186.44s)]
*  But if you fund the government by taxing imports, you get the opposite effect, because while [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=190.92s)]
*  companies and multinational corporations might have to pay taxes on products or parts [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=195.34s)]
*  they're importing, they can just pass these costs onto the workers by raising prices. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=199.70000000000002s)]
*  But this doesn't mean that so-called free trade is really any better. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=205.22s)]
*  In the 70s, the United States began to pursue a strategy of allowing the rest of the world [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  to produce goods and lowering its own tariffs so it could import these goods more cheaply [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=214.04s)]
*  than the US can manufacture them. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  In other words, instead of making cars or washing machines or TVs here, it would be [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=220.9s)]
*  done in sweatshops overseas for a fraction of the cost so Americans could buy these goods [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=225.5s)]
*  at a fraction of the price. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  The last 40 years of free trade have notoriously been a disaster for the working class, which [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=232.10000000000002s)]
*  has basically been surviving on credit cards. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=237.74s)]
*  This was the era of neoliberalism, ending not just terrorists but deregulating the economy, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=240.94s)]
*  lowering taxes on the rich and depressing wages. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=246.3s)]
*  Free trade agreements made it cheaper for American companies to close factories in the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=249.22s)]
*  US and open new ones overseas, decimating the US manufacturing base and turning the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=253.1s)]
*  US economy largely into a financial sector and service-based economy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=258.3s)]
*  Even though tariffs have remained at historic lows for the last few decades, the rich have [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=263.3s)]
*  only gotten richer, and income inequality has again reached sky-high levels. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=267.38s)]
*  If Donald Trump actually wanted to rebuild America's industrial capacity and create [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=272.52s)]
*  jobs for American workers, he would invest money into a massive revitalization campaign [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=277.02s)]
*  to modernize America. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=282.46s)]
*  He would build new factories for 21st century technologies like computer chips and AI. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=284.29999999999995s)]
*  He would build a state-of-the-art national transportation system, a national energy grid, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=289.02s)]
*  repair all of the crumbling bridges and roads, not to mention the crumbling public schools [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=293.9s)]
*  and the shuddering medical clinics. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=298.78s)]
*  He'd start a huge jobs program where anyone can get training to have the skills necessary [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=300.94s)]
*  to complete this project, but he isn't proposing that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=305.7s)]
*  He's proposing tariffs because, frankly, it lets him bully the whole world on behalf [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=308.65999999999997s)]
*  of his billionaire friends. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=313.14s)]
*  So the point here is workers aren't struggling because we don't have tariffs. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=314.9s)]
*  They're struggling because no matter how hard they work or how much they create in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=318.65999999999997s)]
*  the capitalist system, the company's shareholders keep all of the profits. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=322.53999999999996s)]
*  Look no further than the fact that US corporations have been making record profits in the last [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=326.9s)]
*  few years while wages have neared record lows. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=331.46s)]
*  Whether we have tariffs or free trade, corporations will find a way to push the costs on the working [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=335.06s)]
*  class one way or another. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=339.9s)]
*  If there are tariffs, they'll pass the rising cost of imports on us in the form of higher [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=341.74s)]
*  prices. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=346.18s)]
*  If there's free trade, they'll fire us and pay foreign workers in sweatshops for a fraction [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=347.18s)]
*  of the cost. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=351.04s)]
*  As long as we live in a system where CEOs and investors keep the wealth created by workers, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=352.12s)]
*  workers will continue living paycheck to paycheck no matter what the tariff rate is. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=357.86s)]
*  The thing that actually ended the reign of the robber barons in the 1800s and the extreme [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=362.06s)]
*  inequality of the gilded age was workers building organizations, collective action and labor [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=366.54s)]
*  unions. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=372.06s)]
*  So ultimately, this is a question of who holds power, the working class or the capitalist [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=373.06s)]
*  class. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=377.66s)]
*  Thinking we're going to be saved by this or that trade policy is like chasing a mirage. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIhO4AJ1ZBY&t=378.66s)]
