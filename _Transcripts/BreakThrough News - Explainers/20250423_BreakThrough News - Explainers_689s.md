# Israel’s Oldest Newspaper Tried to Smear Us. We Recorded the Whole Thing.
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE)
*  The Israeli newspaper Haaretz tried to run a hit piece against us, decided they didn't like my answers mid-interview, and hung up on me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=0.0s)]
*  Luckily, I recorded the whole thing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=7.0s)]
*  Chok Yokid, a New Jersey-based writer for Haaretz, emailed me last week asking if he could interview me about our film, The Encampments, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=9.0s)]
*  which is about the student movement in solidarity with Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=17.0s)]
*  I agreed, and we set up a Zoom call. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=20.0s)]
*  But as soon as the interview started, his first question was, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=22.0s)]
*  why didn't you include anything about the Jewish students at Columbia who were spit on and assaulted? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=25.0s)]
*  And I said pretty plainly back, who are these students? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=31.0s)]
*  And there was dead silence. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=34.0s)]
*  And he tries asking this again, same thing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=36.0s)]
*  And at this point, I noticed he wasn't actually running a recording on the Zoom call, but was instead typing down what I was saying. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=39.0s)]
*  So out of an abundance of caution, I started running a voice memo on my end. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=46.0s)]
*  And this is where it starts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=50.0s)]
*  I mean, what happened? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=52.0s)]
*  I mean, no, tell me about it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=54.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm curious. I don't know, but who was spit on? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=56.0s)]
*  Which Jewish students were spit on? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=58.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=63.0s)]
*  After I asked him more to tell me about this alleged anti-Semitic spitting incident, he tells me to read Columbia's report about it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=64.0s)]
*  For example, there was a report by Columbia University after that, the way they handled anti-Semitism, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=70.0s)]
*  and they admitted they failed in the way they handled that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=76.0s)]
*  At this point, it should probably already be clear that this guy hasn't read the report himself, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=80.0s)]
*  because if he had read the report, he would know that in the 91 pages, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=85.0s)]
*  there are two quotes from students who claim they were spit on, and there's no actual evidence it happened. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=89.0s)]
*  There are no photos, no videos, no verifiable testimony. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=95.0s)]
*  Mind you, during those two weeks, Columbia's campus was probably the most photographed and videographed square mile on the planet. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=99.0s)]
*  The politicians and the media have been trying to portray the Columbia Cammon as this den of violence and anti-Semitism, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=107.0s)]
*  but if this was the case, how is there not a single video of Jewish students being attacked? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=112.0s)]
*  Furthermore, according to the citations in the report, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=117.0s)]
*  these two quotes were taken from listening sessions facilitated by Halal, a pro-Israel Jewish organization on campus. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=120.0s)]
*  In our film, we interview a university whistleblower who suggests a lot of these incidents were concocted or inflated by pro-Israel students on campus. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=127.0s)]
*  That's corroborated by the large number of Jewish students in our footage who participated in the encampment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=135.0s)]
*  What's so ironic about his obsession with the mythical spitting incident is that there are loads of videos of people who support Israel attacking the pro-Palestine students, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=141.0s)]
*  telling them they should be raped, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=151.0s)]
*  that they should be killed, beating them bloody, and attempting to murder them like they did at UCLA. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=153.0s)]
*  As they say, every accusation is a confession. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=165.0s)]
*  You know what you're doing. I mean, you obviously, you know what tactic you're using. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=168.0s)]
*  You're trying to equate anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=173.0s)]
*  but I haven't, what actual anti-Semitism took place? Can you tell me? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=176.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=184.0s)]
*  The stories that you can find online. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=186.0s)]
*  Name one then. Name one story. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=190.0s)]
*  Tell me, give me one story. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=192.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=194.0s)]
*  Not that I'm going to keep a book up. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=196.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=198.0s)]
*  Then he goes further into his own speculation, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=200.0s)]
*  saying, you'd be naive to think that the students there believe that Israel has a right to exist alongside a Palestinian state. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=202.0s)]
*  And I think you're being naive if you pretend that if you ask most of the protesters there, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=208.0s)]
*  you think Israel should exist alongside Palestinian state, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=214.0s)]
*  most of them would say no, Israel has no right to exist. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=218.0s)]
*  To pretend otherwise, that to, eh. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=221.0s)]
*  So there's one thing to say, end the war and have two-state solution, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=224.0s)]
*  rather from the river to the sea. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=227.0s)]
*  This rhetoric about Israel's right to exist is the cover for saying that an apartheid system has a right to exist, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=228.0s)]
*  to keep excluding the occupied Palestinian people from returning to their native land. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=234.0s)]
*  This is why we all understand that apartheid South Africa or monarchical France didn't have the right to exist [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=239.0s)]
*  because their forms of government were rejected as oppressive. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=245.0s)]
*  The most ironic part of this argument is that people who were part of the apartheid system [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=248.0s)]
*  The most ironic part of this argument is that people who support Israel [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=253.0s)]
*  always say that Palestinians want to wipe Israel off the face of the earth [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=258.0s)]
*  when it's Israel that's actually wiping Gaza off the face of the earth. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=262.0s)]
*  It's the Palestinian state that's been denied, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=267.0s)]
*  and it's the Palestinians who are fighting for their right to exist. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=269.0s)]
*  Again, every accusation is a confession. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=272.0s)]
*  Next, he asked me about the claim that Colombia is invested in weapons manufacturers [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=275.0s)]
*  and asked me if I believe this to be the case, as if it's a matter of opinion. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=280.0s)]
*  The claim that the university is invested in weapon manufacturers, right? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=285.0s)]
*  Is that something that you personally believe is the case? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=291.0s)]
*  Is it something that you investigate or you just bring it from the opinion of the students? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=296.0s)]
*  Or you just bring it from the opinion of the students? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=300.0s)]
*  No, I mean, it's not an opinion. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=301.0s)]
*  Colombia is invested in companies directly and indirectly through their holdings in index funds. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=303.0s)]
*  So they have stocks in companies that are complicit in war crimes. That's a fact. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=311.0s)]
*  This isn't an opinion, and it's something the students have documented quite thoroughly [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=318.0s)]
*  over the course of several years they've been fighting this campaign [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=323.0s)]
*  to get Colombia to divest from companies complicit in genocide. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=326.0s)]
*  He tries to trim me up on the details of how these companies are complicit, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=330.0s)]
*  but he clearly doesn't know that I helped write the divestment resolution at my school when I was in college. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=333.0s)]
*  I believe they're also invested in Caterpillar, which builds the D9 bulldozers. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=339.0s)]
*  In what? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=343.0s)]
*  In Caterpillar. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=344.0s)]
*  And General Electric. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=347.0s)]
*  I will be involved when the war… [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=351.0s)]
*  General Electric? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=353.0s)]
*  General Electric makes the engine for the AH-64 Apache helicopter, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=355.0s)]
*  which is the attack helicopter that Israel uses. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=359.0s)]
*  AH-64? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=363.0s)]
*  AH-64 Apache helicopter, yes. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=364.0s)]
*  The interview goes on pretty normally for the next few minutes until he asks me [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=367.0s)]
*  why I think Colombia decided to arrest their students on April 18th, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=370.0s)]
*  which sparked the global encampment movement. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=373.0s)]
*  I told him Colombia arrested their students because they're beholden to their donors who support Israel. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=376.0s)]
*  His follow-up question is crazy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=381.0s)]
*  I mean, that's Colombia's agenda is to… [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=383.0s)]
*  they are beholden to their donors, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=388.0s)]
*  so when their donors say something like, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=391.0s)]
*  we don't want pro-Palestine protests on our campus, they listen. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=393.0s)]
*  What about… [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=397.0s)]
*  tell about the money from the donors who support Israel, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=399.0s)]
*  but there are many reports about money coming from the Gulf countries, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=402.0s)]
*  from Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, all this, you know, Qatar. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=405.0s)]
*  How does that play a role in the way the university is reacting? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=410.0s)]
*  The thing about this comment that's so revealing is that the Gulf countries, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=415.0s)]
*  specifically the two countries he mentions, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=419.0s)]
*  the UAE and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=421.0s)]
*  have normalized relations with Israel. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=423.0s)]
*  They've basically abandoned the Palestinian people in their time of greatest need. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=425.0s)]
*  If anything, Gulf money going into Middle East studies departments and Islamic centers [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=430.0s)]
*  and American universities is undermining the Palestinian cause [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=435.0s)]
*  and defanging these departments. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=438.0s)]
*  So he's actually making my point about pro-Israel money, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=440.0s)]
*  but I don't even think he realized that. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=443.0s)]
*  Is it coming from private individuals? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=445.0s)]
*  Is it coming from the state? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=447.0s)]
*  Is it coming to Columbia University? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=448.0s)]
*  Are you saying it's going to the students? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=451.0s)]
*  Because that's something that has been, you know, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=453.0s)]
*  people are saying, oh, the students were funded by outside groups, all this. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=456.0s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=460.0s)]
*  I'm not sure what you're saying. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=461.0s)]
*  I'm saying about Google later, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=465.0s)]
*  about reports about Arab countries donating $8 billion to Ivy League universities. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=467.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=473.0s)]
*  You can check later if you want. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=474.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=476.0s)]
*  You know, the Gulf countries also support Israel, so... [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=478.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=485.0s)]
*  I mean, well, hold on. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=486.0s)]
*  I mean, you're talking about the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia, UAE. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=488.0s)]
*  I mean, they're trying to normalize with Israel, so I'm not really sure that... [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=492.0s)]
*  The last question he asked was how I feel about the abduction of Mahmoud. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=502.0s)]
*  Here was my answer, which made him completely lose it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=506.0s)]
*  This is the logical extreme of the Israel lobby and Zionism in America. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=509.0s)]
*  They know they've lost the argument. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=515.0s)]
*  They know they've completely lost the younger generation, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=517.0s)]
*  which is exactly what the encampment movement showed. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=521.0s)]
*  So they're now trying to just ban... [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=524.0s)]
*  They're just trying to make it illegal to support Palestine. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=529.0s)]
*  They're trying to ban free speech because they know they've lost the argument. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=532.0s)]
*  There was a poll that came out, you know, a week or two ago that said [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=536.0s)]
*  that now the majority of Americans, both Republican and Democrat, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=541.0s)]
*  have negative views of Israel. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=545.0s)]
*  I mean, Israel... [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=547.0s)]
*  Listen, okay. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=548.0s)]
*  Yes? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=549.0s)]
*  I think my editors will publish it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=550.0s)]
*  I can talk to them and maybe email you back if I see that they are... [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=552.0s)]
*  I don't think they're going to publish this manifest. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=555.0s)]
*  I just don't want to waste your time and my time. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=557.0s)]
*  I don't feel comfortable sharing an opinion of someone who says that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=559.0s)]
*  no Jewish students was attacked, part of the students... [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=562.0s)]
*  You're putting words in my mouth. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=564.0s)]
*  I asked you to tell me about the incidents you're referring to. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=566.0s)]
*  If you were there for months and months and you're not aware of any students [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=569.0s)]
*  who was attacked, then there's no point of this interview. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=573.0s)]
*  Sorry, sorry, sorry. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=575.0s)]
*  I never said no... [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=577.0s)]
*  None of them was attacked. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=579.0s)]
*  Listen, I talked to my editors. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=580.0s)]
*  I don't want to waste my time. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=582.0s)]
*  No, tell me who it was. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=583.0s)]
*  Check later. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=586.0s)]
*  Check later the reports and I'll talk to you later. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=587.0s)]
*  You're the one... [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=590.0s)]
*  It's a waste of both of our times, I'll be honest with you. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=592.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=595.0s)]
*  You've got your time. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=597.0s)]
*  No, this is... [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=598.0s)]
*  It's obvious. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=599.0s)]
*  It's a waste of your time because you're not getting the answers you want. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=600.0s)]
*  That's pathetic. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=603.0s)]
*  That's pathetic. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=604.0s)]
*  I mean, if you want to spin a certain narrative... [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=606.0s)]
*  Ha! [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=609.0s)]
*  He just closed the interview. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=611.0s)]
*  He closed the interview. That's amazing. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=613.0s)]
*  Haaretz presents itself as the liberal, open-minded newspaper in Israeli society. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=615.0s)]
*  And this guy made a point of saying that several times on our call. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=620.0s)]
*  And yet here they are, hanging up on their own interview [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=624.0s)]
*  because they didn't like my answers, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=627.0s)]
*  going as far as to subtly encourage me to change my answers [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=629.0s)]
*  to get this interview published. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=632.0s)]
*  But the whole point of our work at Breakthrough and this film [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=634.0s)]
*  is to stop catering to what the mainstream media considers respectable. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=637.0s)]
*  So, yeah, not going to happen. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=641.0s)]
*  Israel's PR strategy has always been to make itself out to be the victim, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=644.0s)]
*  which is exactly what you're seeing on this call. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=648.0s)]
*  This journalist took an interview about a film about a genocide [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=650.0s)]
*  and the destruction of all of Gaza's universities [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=654.0s)]
*  and somehow still makes himself out to be the victim. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=657.0s)]
*  The idea that it's the students camping out on lawns [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=660.0s)]
*  who are violent and hateful [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=663.0s)]
*  and not the nuclear-armed superpower [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=665.0s)]
*  stomping off against a largely defenseless population [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=667.0s)]
*  is just the latest insane narrative that Israel's trying to spin [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=670.0s)]
*  in its fraudulent victimhood narrative. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=673.0s)]
*  It should come as no surprise that the people who've been defending [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=675.0s)]
*  Israel's barbarity for the last 18 months [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=678.0s)]
*  are now facing isolation, alienation, and social consequences. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=681.0s)]
*  But no, there's no proof these students got spin on. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlNJWDxGfYE&t=685.0s)]
