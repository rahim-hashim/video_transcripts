# Israel Has Been Trying To Ban Free Speech For Years
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U)
*  Will we ban free speech in America so Israel can continue committing genocide? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=4.44s)]
*  You probably saw that on Saturday, DHS agents followed a Palestinian Columbia student, Mahmoud [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=5.84s)]
*  Khalil, into his apartment building and said they had a warrant for his arrest. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=11.06s)]
*  Khalil, who was one of the lead negotiators in the Columbia University Gaza Solidarity [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  encampment and is a permanent resident in the United States, was arrested in front of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=19.92s)]
*  his eight-months pregnant wife and is now facing deportation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=24.12s)]
*  ICE sent him to be detained in rural Louisiana, as far away from his family and lawyers as [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=28.28s)]
*  possible. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=32.84s)]
*  Currently, a judge has halted the deportation process and what comes next is yet to be seen. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=33.84s)]
*  In a statement, a DHS spokesperson said Khalil was arrested because he quote, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=38.44s)]
*  "...led activities aligned to Hamas." [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=42.92s)]
*  But we all know that his real crime was helping lead the movement against Israel's genocide, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=45.52s)]
*  which ironically is the actual crime at play here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=50.36s)]
*  This is part of a years-long campaign by the Israel lobby to basically outlaw any criticism [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=53.68s)]
*  of Israel in the United States. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  Here's what you need to know. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=60.0s)]
*  Public opinion has become Israel's Achilles heel in the U.S. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=61.76s)]
*  People are starting to wake up to the fact that Israel is in some kind of pluralistic [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=65.66s)]
*  democracy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=69.24s)]
*  It's an ethnostate, meaning it's a country based on the demographic supremacy of one [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=70.24s)]
*  ethnic group over another. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=74.92s)]
*  The whole point of Israel as a country is to create a Jewish majority in Palestine by [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=76.7s)]
*  bringing Jews from all across the world to kick the native Palestinians out and build [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=81.6s)]
*  Jewish-only cities in their place. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=85.96s)]
*  Every single place and every single land, every little spot, everything is a Jew, not [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  a single piece for other people, only for us. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  While we don't have time to go through the entire history of this, we made a video about [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=96.56s)]
*  it called Israel's Goal Has Always Been Ethnic Cleansing, which you can search up on YouTube. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=100.44s)]
*  But the point here is that more and more people are becoming acutely aware that Israel isn't [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=105.28s)]
*  this tiny, victimized country that it says it is. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=110.0s)]
*  Israel's post-October 7 genocide completely shattered this narrative. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=113.52s)]
*  Not just the massacres, but the videos, the chants, the concerts, the TikTok trends, the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=117.32s)]
*  branding of Palestinian prisoners with the Star of David, the Israeli army looting lingerie [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=133.68s)]
*  from Palestinian women they had killed. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=139.64s)]
*  Let's not forget, Israel nearly descended into a civil war because Israelis felt like [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=141.88s)]
*  Israeli soldiers had a right to rape Palestinian prisoners. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=147.0s)]
*  The whole framing of Israel as this helpless victim has been completely shattered by the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  images of a country reveling in slaughter and land theft. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  You'll see this written everywhere in pro-Israel publications, that the greatest international [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  threat to Israel now isn't Hamas or Hezbollah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=164.26s)]
*  It's losing their whole international legitimacy as a state. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=167.84s)]
*  Protests, court cases, and mass discussion of Israel's crimes have reshaped global [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=171.44s)]
*  consciousness and undermined the foundational apartheid principles of the state. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=176.44s)]
*  This is why Israel has spent years trying to criminalize protests and free speech in [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=181.4s)]
*  the United States. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=185.56s)]
*  There's no doubt that the White House itself made the decision to arrest Mahmoud Hallyu. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=186.56s)]
*  Trump had in fact personally honored the arresting agent years ago. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=191.08s)]
*  It's part of the administration's political offensive to whip the universities into line [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  and attack the Palestine movement at the same time. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=198.84s)]
*  But what's not being discussed is the Israel lobby's role in all this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=201.52s)]
*  Trump's cabinet is stuffed to the brim with people who are closely connected to the Israel [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=205.0s)]
*  lobby. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=208.8s)]
*  Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, Pete Hegseth, Elise Stefanik, Elon Musk, Mike Waltz, RFK [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=209.8s)]
*  Jr., Pam Bondi, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=216.56s)]
*  I actually don't think there's anyone in his cabinet who doesn't support Israel. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=219.68s)]
*  One of the Trump campaign's largest donors was Miriam Adelson, who's a billionaire [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=223.32s)]
*  and Israel First mega-donor that put over $100 million into the Trump campaign. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  The Israel lobby also openly aided the Trump administration in finding the students in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=232.44s)]
*  this deportation effort. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=236.92s)]
*  An Israeli group called B'tar US, which is basically the US arm of the far-right Israeli [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=238.2s)]
*  Likud party, had been sending names of pro-Palestine student activists to the Trump administration [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=243.12s)]
*  for deportation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=248.85999999999999s)]
*  To give you a sense of these people, they posted recently that they wanted Israel to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=250.32s)]
*  kill more Palestinian children. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=254.0s)]
*  Literally. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=256.28s)]
*  That's something they actually posted. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=257.28s)]
*  On Twitter, they openly called for the students on the list they sent to the Trump administration [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=258.96s)]
*  to be deported and bragged that they would send even more names. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=262.76s)]
*  This was only a few weeks before Mahmoud was arrested. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=266.28s)]
*  Israel was also heavily involved in pushing the US TikTok ban. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  According to records, one of the main pro-Israel lobby groups, the Anti-Defamation League, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=272.96s)]
*  and another pro-Israel group, Hadassah, lobbied in favor of the TikTok ban. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=278.0s)]
*  The ADL called it an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that they were trying to ban TikTok, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=282.56s)]
*  even though the CEO of the ADL himself, Jonathan Greenblatt, said multiple times on record [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=287.36s)]
*  that the app should be banned. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=292.6s)]
*  We need to talk about TikTok. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=294.32s)]
*  TikTok, if you will, is the 24-7 news channel of so many of our young people and it's like [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=297.04s)]
*  on steroids, amplifying and intensifying the anti-Semitism and the anti-Zion with no repercussions. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=305.14s)]
*  I've got to ask, Joe, like there's been a lot of lamentations about the fact that TikTok's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=313.65999999999997s)]
*  ownership is Chinese, but you know what? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=318.02s)]
*  Oracle owns 10% of the company. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=320.97999999999996s)]
*  General Atlantic owns a piece of the company. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=323.26s)]
*  Our friends at Sequoia Capital own a piece of the company. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=326.58s)]
*  So does Sequoia and General Atlantic? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=329.38s)]
*  Does Oracle want to be responsible for spreading anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=331.92s)]
*  It's time to talk about TikTok. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=337.88s)]
*  And I think we need members of Congress to be asking them, why are they doing it up? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=341.04s)]
*  Capturing TikTok might seem less meaningful than holding on to Mount Hermon. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=345.36s)]
*  Libelous tweets certainly might seem less deadly than missiles from Yemen. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=350.8s)]
*  But this is urgent because the next war will be decided based on how Israel and its allies [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=357.36s)]
*  perform online as much as offline. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=364.7s)]
*  Prominent Israel lobby politicians like Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham, and Nikki Haley also [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  cited anti-Israel content as the reason they supported punitive action against TikTok. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=374.36s)]
*  Many of the most draconian speech laws that have been passed in the United States in the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=379.32s)]
*  last few years have been laws regulating speech related to Israel. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=382.64s)]
*  By the 2010s, Israel lobby groups were pushing laws that made support for the Palestinian [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=387.0s)]
*  Solidarity Movement, boycott, divestment, and sanctions a fireable offense. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=391.44s)]
*  These laws, which were written almost identically, forced government contractors to pledge that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=396.56s)]
*  they wouldn't boycott Israeli products. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=401.08s)]
*  Refusing to sign would result in not being hired or being denied state funding. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=403.56s)]
*  In one famous case, Empire Files journalist Abby Martin was disinvited from a speaking [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=407.66s)]
*  event at Georgia Southern University because she refused to sign a pledge saying she wouldn't [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=412.2s)]
*  boycott Israel. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=416.48s)]
*  The ADL and AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, endorsed and pushed these [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=418.0s)]
*  laws, which picked up the nickname Loyalty Oaths, despite the ADL's own internal reporting [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=422.88s)]
*  expressing concern that trying to censor pro-Palestine speech would only garner more support for [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  the cause. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=433.68s)]
*  There are 37 states in America that have passed these anti-speech laws. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=434.68s)]
*  The main Israel lobby group in Washington, AIPAC, shapes U.S. policy on Israel by interfering [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=439.24s)]
*  in U.S. congressional elections and congressional affairs. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=445.24s)]
*  It pushes every candidate running for Congress to take a stance on Israel and then directs [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=448.88s)]
*  massive cash flows to the candidate with more pro-Israel views. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  If there's any candidate that refuses to support Israel or is even marginally critical of it, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=457.41999999999996s)]
*  AIPAC will support the candidate's opponent and spend tens of millions of dollars launching [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=462.76s)]
*  a smear campaign against that candidate. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  This is precisely what happened to progressive congressional incumbents like Cory Bush and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=469.96s)]
*  Once pro-Israel members are in Congress, they're showered with gifts, fancy dinners, and donations [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=475.16s)]
*  to keep them loyal. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=480.40000000000003s)]
*  When big bills concerning Israel come up, they get their talking points from AIPAC lobbyists. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  There's a really good documentary about how the Israel lobby operates in America called [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  The Lobby U.S., which you can find on the Electronic Antifata's YouTube page. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=491.0s)]
*  I definitely recommend watching it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=495.48s)]
*  A few years ago, there was an entire controversy manufactured by the Israel lobby that it was [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=497.24s)]
*  actually anti-Semitic to say that AIPAC money was influencing members of Congress. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=502.26s)]
*  But if you go on AIPAC's Twitter, they brag about how they win 95% of elections they intervene [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=507.82s)]
*  in and directly claimed responsibility for Bush and Bowman's defeats. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=513.9s)]
*  So in other words, they can say they influence elections, but we can't. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=518.58s)]
*  Even though the Israel lobby is trying hard to sustain U.S. support for Israel, it's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzk-zQgI-U&t=522.46s)]
