Video Description: Latin America wants to create the OPEC of lithium.
Three Latin American countries control 65% of the world's lithium reserves and could band together to set the price.
BT's Kei Pritsker explains what this would mean and why the US is so obsessed with Latin America's lithium.

# Latin America Wants to Create the OPEC of Lithium. Here's What That Could Mean.
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [May 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8)
*  Latin America wants to create a lithium cartel that's guaranteed to drive the US crazy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=0.0s)]
*  Lithium is one of the most important resources in the world and the central component in [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=5.46s)]
*  batteries, which virtually all electronics, including the rising electric vehicle industry, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=9.26s)]
*  rely on. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  While lithium is needed in every corner of the world, the majority of the world's lithium [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  is in just three countries, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=18.84s)]
*  These three countries, commonly known as the lithium triangle, announce that they want [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  to band together to set the price of lithium, an arrangement commonly known as a cartel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=26.18s)]
*  This arrangement would have massive geopolitical implications, which would shift the global [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=30.78s)]
*  balance of powers further to the global south. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=34.74s)]
*  Here's what you need to know. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  Bolivia's President Luis Arce recently gave a speech where he called for Latin American [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=38.46s)]
*  lithium producers to band together and form a collective lithium policy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=42.64s)]
*  He said, quote, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=46.46s)]
*  We must be united in the market in a sovereign manner with prices that benefit our economies. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=47.46s)]
*  The price of lithium has grown exponentially with the kickoff of the EV revolution. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=53.0s)]
*  The lithium car battery market for electric vehicles is expected to grow ten times larger [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=57.24s)]
*  over the next decade. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=61.84s)]
*  Arce also made it abundantly clear why he felt this cartel was needed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=63.32s)]
*  He said, quote, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  We don't want our lithium to be in the Southern Command's crosshairs, nor do we want it [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  to be a reason for destabilizing democratically elected governments or foreign harassment. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=71.7s)]
*  It's no secret that EV manufacturers like Tesla and Ford need Latin America's lithium, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=75.8s)]
*  and they need it cheap. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=81.12s)]
*  In 2019, the U.S. openly sponsored a right-wing coup against Bolivia's then socialist president, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  Evo Morales. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  While the U.S. used the usual excuse that they were supporting the coup for the sake [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  of democracy, it's widely believed that one of the central reasons the U.S. was so [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=92.44s)]
*  eager to oust Evo Morales was because of his mining policies. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  As president, Evo Morales nationalized the mining industry and said that any company [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=100.76s)]
*  that wanted to extract Bolivian lithium had to mine alongside Bolivian mining companies [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=105.14s)]
*  as an equal partner. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  The coup government under Janine Anyas wanted to privatize lithium, but wasn't in power [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=111.34s)]
*  long enough to do so. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=116.0s)]
*  However, Elon Musk basically admitted that the coup in Bolivia was a coup for lithium [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  in a tweet where someone accused Elon Musk of being involved in the planning of the coup [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=122.14s)]
*  for Tesla's interest in Bolivia's lithium. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=126.0s)]
*  Instead of denying the accusation, Musk simply responded by saying, we will coup whoever [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=128.62s)]
*  we want. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk owns the biggest electric vehicle company in the world, and would profit massively [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=134.42000000000002s)]
*  from a neoliberal government in Bolivia that's willing to export Bolivia's lithium for cheap. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=138.82s)]
*  But the most damning evidence of all is the U.S. military's southern command admitting [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=143.4s)]
*  its intimate involvement in securing lithium in Latin America. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  I had a Zoom call with the U.S. ambassadors from Argentina and Chile, and then also the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=151.26s)]
*  strategy officer from Levant, and then also the VP for global operations from Albemarle [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  for lithium, to talk about the lithium triangle in Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile, and the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=166.22s)]
*  companies, how they're doing, and what they see in terms of challenges and things like [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=173.38s)]
*  that in the lithium business, and then the aggressiveness or the influence and coercion [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=179.18s)]
*  from the PRC. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=186.18s)]
*  And so the ability to get those groups together, to leverage what's really happening on the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=187.18s)]
*  ground, and how can we help, and who else can we bring to the table to help us figure [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=194.18s)]
*  this problem out, and box out our adversaries, box out our competitors by teaming together [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  with each other and others. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=206.02s)]
*  Well, you might be asking yourself why a four-star U.S. Army general is calling up lithium companies [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=207.82s)]
*  in Latin America. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=213.3s)]
*  Consider the fact that the Biden administration issued executive orders designating lithium [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=214.78s)]
*  supply lines a matter of national security for the United States. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=219.06s)]
*  Of course, when they say national security, they're not saying that securing lithium [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=223.12s)]
*  supply lines is going to cure cancer or heart disease, which kill hundreds of thousands [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=227.0s)]
*  of Americans every year. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=231.02s)]
*  They're talking about the security of corporate profits, and the fact that China is quickly [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=232.4s)]
*  becoming one of the biggest EV manufacturers in the world. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=236.36s)]
*  The three countries of the lithium triangle, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina, control about [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=239.3s)]
*  65% of the world's lithium. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=244.08s)]
*  Mexico, Peru, and Brazil, who have also expressed interest in joining a joint lithium block, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=246.32s)]
*  would bump that up to 70%. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=250.72s)]
*  Combined, these countries would basically be able to set the price of lithium by controlling [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=252.6s)]
*  the rate of extraction, similar to the way OPEC controls the price of oil. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=256.94s)]
*  This would of course be devastating to companies like Tesla, who want lithium as cheaply as possible. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=261.08s)]
*  When Evo Morales was in power, his government nationalized the hydrocarbon industry and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=266.1s)]
*  used the revenue to cut poverty in half and increase social spending by 80%. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=270.36s)]
*  When it comes to lithium, Latin America faces a similar choice. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=275.21999999999997s)]
*  Latin America's lithium wealth can be extracted for the benefit of a few transnational corporations, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=278.72s)]
*  or for the benefit of the people of Latin America. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  for the benefit of the people of Latin America. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt0dN2Va1c8&t=308.72s)]
