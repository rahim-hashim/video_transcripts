# Warhawk Senator Bob Menendez Resigns After Being Found Guilty of Taking Bribes to Be a Foreign Agent
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4)
*  US Senator Bob Menendez just resigned after being found guilty of accepting gold bars, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=0.0s)]
*  wads of cash, luxury cars, and all kinds of other gifts as bribes to do the bidding of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=5.3s)]
*  the Egyptian and Qatari governments. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=10.56s)]
*  A US federal court found him guilty on all 16 of the charges he was facing, which include [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=12.16s)]
*  bribery, obstruction of justice, acting as a foreign agent, and now Menendez, who's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=16.6s)]
*  70 years old, faces up to 222 years in prison in what's being described as one of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=21.8s)]
*  most high profile, and brazen corruption schemes in recent congressional memory. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=27.08s)]
*  As one prosecutor put it, his years of selling his office to the highest bidder have finally [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  come to an end. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=36.72s)]
*  The case speaks volumes about how the Senate Foreign Relations Committee works, and the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=37.96s)]
*  double standards around how it decides who are the foreign agents. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=41.76s)]
*  So what did he do? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=45.4s)]
*  The essence of it is that Bob Menendez used his position in the leadership of the Senate [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=47.06s)]
*  Foreign Relations Committee to secure business and weapons deals for the Egyptian and Qatari [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=51.56s)]
*  governments and protect their agents from prosecution. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=56.08s)]
*  Menendez held positions of leadership on the committee for almost a decade, first as a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=59.44s)]
*  ranking member and then as the chair from 2015 to 2023. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=63.62s)]
*  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee handles legislation pertaining to US foreign policy [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=67.84s)]
*  and deals with matters like foreign aid, weapon sales, confirmations for the State Department, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=71.62s)]
*  and so on. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=77.36s)]
*  It's an incredibly powerful committee, which made Bob Menendez a very powerful senator. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=78.36s)]
*  As a leader of the committee, he had the power to approve and deny huge foreign aid [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=82.78s)]
*  and weapons shipments to allies. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=86.94s)]
*  Congress started withholding authorization for Egyptian weapons shipments after the election [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=88.94s)]
*  of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who turned Egypt into a complete police state and maintains [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=93.14s)]
*  power through widespread human rights abuses. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=98.06s)]
*  Bob Menendez used his position to start approving these weapons sales again, despite objections [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  from his colleagues. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=105.34s)]
*  So how does something like this start? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=106.78s)]
*  In 2018, Bob Menendez started dating his current wife, Nadine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=108.7s)]
*  When they started dating, Nadine introduced Menendez to her friend of many years, Wael [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=112.82000000000001s)]
*  Hana, nicknamed Will Hana, someone she knew was an agent of the Egyptian government. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  They have dinner, and at this very fancy restaurant they're eating at, they work out a deal where [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=122.18s)]
*  Bob Menendez will approve weapon sales for Egypt in exchange for his girlfriend getting [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=126.94s)]
*  a job where she gets paid to do nothing at Will Hana's company. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=131.8s)]
*  Menendez then proceeded to act as an agent of the Egyptian government, doing things like [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=135.5s)]
*  sending highly sensitive information about employees at the U.S. Embassy in Egypt to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=139.54000000000002s)]
*  members of the Egyptian government, disclosing non-public information to Will Hana about [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=143.58s)]
*  Egyptian weapons bans, getting talking points from Egyptian agents on why Egypt should receive [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=147.96s)]
*  weapons shipments, and even ghostwriting letters for the Egyptian government that were being [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=152.74s)]
*  sent to other U.S. senators to persuade them to release a hold on $300 million in aid. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=157.56s)]
*  He also tried to steer the U.S. Secretary of State's negotiations around the Grand [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=164.04s)]
*  Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, one of the most important foreign policy issues for Egypt. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=167.56s)]
*  As more requests came in, the more gifts Menendez and his wife got. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=173.0s)]
*  Here are pictures of some of those gifts taken during a raid on Bob Menendez's house. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=176.68s)]
*  He had half a million dollars of cash stuffed in jackets around his house, hundreds of thousands [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=180.89999999999998s)]
*  of dollars worth of gold bars, a Mercedes bought from them by an Egyptian agent. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  Not pictured are house furnishings, appliances, a $20,000 mortgage payment that the Egyptian [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=190.52s)]
*  agents made on the Menendez home. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  Nadine usually acted as the middleman between Menendez and the Egyptians, sending requests [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=198.44s)]
*  to Bob and then passing the information he gave to the Egyptians. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=202.84s)]
*  She would also frequently complain when money wasn't coming in on time, and would twist [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=207.12s)]
*  Bob's arm to get them to send money faster. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=210.96s)]
*  The Egyptians were sending money from Will Hana's Halal Certification Company to an [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=213.56s)]
*  that Nadine had set up for the purpose of this deal. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  At one point, the U.S. Department of Agriculture tried going after Will Hana's company because [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=220.88000000000002s)]
*  their company was acting in a way that hurt the interests of American businesses. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  So what did Menendez do? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=229.52s)]
*  He called the USDA and told them to stand down. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=231.06s)]
*  In 2020, the Menendez's expanded their operations and became agents of the Qatari government. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=234.0s)]
*  They helped one of their associates land a multi-million dollar business deal with a [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=238.8s)]
*  company tied to the Qatari government in exchange for more gold bars, expensive watches, tickets, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=242.24s)]
*  tickets to the Formula One Grand Prix. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=247.32s)]
*  You get the idea. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=249.68s)]
*  The grand irony of all this is that as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=250.92s)]
*  Bob Menendez spent most of his career accusing other countries of the exact kind of corruption [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=255.84s)]
*  he was engaged in. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=261.68s)]
*  Here he is saying that Russia is trying to undermine our democracy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=263.18s)]
*  Anyone who tries to undermine our democracy, who in essence created a 21st century attack [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=267.28s)]
*  through their cyber attacks against our democracy, is a foe. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=272.88s)]
*  Here he is comparing Venezuela's president to Al Capone. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=277.2s)]
*  Because given Maduro's track record, given that he makes Al Capone look tame, there can [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=280.56s)]
*  be no return to normalcy with this regime. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=286.84s)]
*  Here he is saying that Cuba is trying to covertly influence U.S. politics. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  I think it should be pretty appalling that a foreign government would be engaged in trying [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=295.48s)]
*  to affect an election and or the position of a United States senator. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=301.9s)]
*  Mind you, in that clip, he was actually deflecting accusations around another corruption scandal [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=306.16s)]
*  he was involved in by saying he was set up by Cuban spies. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=311.16s)]
*  And finally, here he is accusing China of, wait for it, bribing leaders of other countries [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=315.34s)]
*  in exchange for political favors. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=322.66s)]
*  Debt trap diplomacy, where these countries become hostage to China, not only economically, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=325.44s)]
*  but then in a transactional basis, China says, well, you can't recognize Taiwan anymore. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=333.04s)]
*  Or China says, you have to vote with us at the UN in the way we want, or at the UN Human [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=338.56s)]
*  Rights Commission. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=343.5s)]
*  As Americans, we're constantly being told that there's this looming foreign threat, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=344.8s)]
*  whether it's the threat of terrorism or communism. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=349.76s)]
*  In the last two decades alone, the U.S. has bombed seven countries to allegedly stop terrorism. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=352.72s)]
*  And in all the years since 9-11, there have only been 366 Americans killed by terrorism. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=359.24s)]
*  Compare that with, say, the approximately 700,000 Americans that die every year of heart [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=365.36s)]
*  disease and it becomes pretty obvious, pretty quickly, that the so-called terrorism threat [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=371.0s)]
*  might actually be a cover for the fact that we spent tens of trillions of dollars fighting [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=376.6s)]
*  these wars, which just happened to give rise to an entirely new generation of multimillionaires [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=380.76s)]
*  and billionaires that made their entire fortunes through war. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=386.0s)]
*  And the craziest thing is, the exact kind of lies peddled by Bob Menendez are the ones [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=389.44s)]
*  that are being used right now to justify this foreign policy of world conquest that kills [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=395.12s)]
*  millions of people. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=400.6s)]
*  For example, these accusations of rampant corruption in Venezuela are now being used [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=402.48s)]
*  to justify the U.S.-backed coup in Venezuela that's happening as we speak. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=407.08s)]
*  The AIPAC talking points that Bob Menendez peddled as a PR job for Israel are used on [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=411.6s)]
*  a regular basis to justify more money being sent to their genocide and now even a regional [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=416.6s)]
*  war with Iran. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=422.24s)]
*  Menendez's lies about Cuba are routinely used to justify the universally condemned economic [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=423.92s)]
*  blockade of Cuba. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=429.36s)]
*  So what the Menendez corruption case really proves is that we don't know if anything [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=431.24s)]
*  Congress tells us is true. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=434.92s)]
*  For all we know, they could be regurgitating talking points from some lobbyists that bought [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=436.44s)]
*  them a car. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=440.72s)]
*  And it's not just Menendez either. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  The Clint Foundation stole money from the Haitian earthquake relief effort. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=443.8s)]
*  Joe Biden got his son a no-show job on the board of a Ukrainian gas company even though [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=447.68s)]
*  he had no experience. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=451.56s)]
*  His son also sells these bizarre paintings for tens of thousands of dollars. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=453.44000000000005s)]
*  I'm not really sure if there's some artistic vision I'm missing or if it's just a cover [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=457.40000000000003s)]
*  for money laundering. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=461.62s)]
*  And how about the fact that the Bush family openly did business with the Bin Laden family, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  where then Nancy Pelosi has become so synonymous with insider trading that it's become a [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=467.76s)]
*  running joke and traders follow her stock trading as a legitimate trading strategy. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=472.04s)]
*  How else did she end up being worth $240 million off of a Congressional salary of $200,000? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=478.08s)]
*  Isn't it a great upon fact that an untold number of U.S. politicians were part of or [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=483.84s)]
*  looked the other way for Jeffrey Epstein's human trafficking blackmail ring? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=487.96s)]
*  So I'm going to shoot straight. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=491.88s)]
*  The perception between a lot of young people is that there is an untouchable ring of governmental [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=493.84s)]
*  and economic elites in this country that not only benefit, like she mentioned, but actively [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=499.76s)]
*  participate in sex trafficking. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=505.4s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein was an example. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=508.2s)]
*  Robert Kraft was arrested not far from here on trafficking charges. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=510.12s)]
*  Are these power players a priority for us right now? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=515.78s)]
*  Can we even touch them? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=519.42s)]
*  Or is this a pipe dream that we need to address in the future somehow? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=521.42s)]
*  You know, it's like everything. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=524.42s)]
*  It hides in plain sight. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=528.62s)]
*  Epstein was hiding in plain sight. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=529.9s)]
*  We all knew about him. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=531.3399999999999s)]
*  We all knew what he was doing. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=532.66s)]
*  We all knew what he was doing. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=534.2199999999999s)]
*  These crimes are so heinous and corrupt that it can be hard to believe at times. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=535.8399999999999s)]
*  But consider the fact that these people do the most heinous and downright psychopathic [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=540.5799999999999s)]
*  things that harm millions of people in broad daylight. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=545.42s)]
*  They killed over a million people in Iraq over a lie to finance their vacation homes. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=549.18s)]
*  They funded armed militias in Libya to murder the sovereign leader of that country and plunged [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=554.92s)]
*  it into civil war just so they could increase their shares of Libya's oil and gold reserves. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=559.9799999999999s)]
*  Anyone responsible for doing that probably has no qualms about committing financial or [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=566.2199999999999s)]
*  sexual crimes. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=570.8599999999999s)]
*  The point here is that all of this contradicts one of the most fundamental things we're [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=572.2199999999999s)]
*  taught in this country. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=576.38s)]
*  That America is a meritocracy or land of opportunity, meaning that it doesn't matter who you are, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=577.62s)]
*  where you come from, or how little you have, that if you work hard, you'll be rewarded. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=583.7s)]
*  America is not a meritocracy. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=588.66s)]
*  Some of the hardest working people in this country, people that work two or three jobs, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=590.94s)]
*  60, 70 hours a week, live their whole lives barely keeping their head above water. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=595.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, the most talentless, sleazy, selfish people run everything. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  In fact, the only thing we can actually conclude from this is that the system doesn't reward [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=606.82s)]
*  hard work, that it rewards corrupt behavior. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=611.12s)]
*  And the reason for this is, in a system where everything is for sale, aka capitalism, even [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=614.3000000000001s)]
*  public policy and the morality of our government is for sale, and the ones most willing to [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=619.74s)]
*  sell their souls rise to the top. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=624.34s)]
*  So as we enter the election season and the Democrats try to convince us all that the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=626.5400000000001s)]
*  Republicans and Trump are some kind of den of corruption and that they don't care about [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=630.58s)]
*  the people at all, just remember that Kamala Harris is bought and paid for too. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=634.62s)]
*  Her donor list reads like a who's who of Wall Street bankers, and her top advisors [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=639.18s)]
*  are a lawyer for Uber and two former heads of BlackRock. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=643.54s)]
*  So if you've ever felt like it doesn't matter who you vote for or who gets elected, that's [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=648.14s)]
*  because it largely doesn't. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=652.9s)]
*  The two parties actually pit us against each other by driving wedges between us on a few [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=654.86s)]
*  select issues, but when it comes to endless wars, bailing out the banks, letting big tech [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=659.22s)]
*  and big pharma write our laws, mass surveillance, giving more money to the police state, supporting [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=664.3s)]
*  Israel's genocide, the two parties are quite literally indistinguishable. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=669.78s)]
*  The problem isn't this or that politician. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=675.62s)]
*  It's the whole capitalist system, which to quote our New York prosecutor friend in the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=678.46s)]
*  Menendez case, operates simply by selling political power to the highest bidder. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4-P0itaX4&t=682.62s)]
