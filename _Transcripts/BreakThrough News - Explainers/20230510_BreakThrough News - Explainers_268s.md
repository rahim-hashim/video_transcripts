# BRICS Announces New Currency to Replace the Dollar
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [May 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA)
*  Brics just announced a new global currency designed to replace the dollar. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=0.0s)]
*  The Deputy Chairman of Russia's state Duma, Alexander Babikov, told reporters that the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=4.0s)]
*  BRICS alliance, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, is creating [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=8.32s)]
*  a new currency that will be backed by gold, rare earth metals, and other critical commodities. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=13.48s)]
*  BRICS will likely take up the task of creating this new currency at the next BRICS summit [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=18.82s)]
*  in late August. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=22.64s)]
*  While there's still a lot of things we don't know about the currency, the announcement [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=23.64s)]
*  alone is a huge development. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=27.02s)]
*  Since 1945, the US dollar has been the world reserve currency, meaning it acts as the standard [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=29.32s)]
*  currency for all international payments. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=34.4s)]
*  This means that if Japan wants to trade with Thailand, they wouldn't pay each other using [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=36.7s)]
*  yen or baht, they would use the US dollar. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=40.52s)]
*  The dollar's monopoly is especially strong in the oil trade, which until recently was [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=43.58s)]
*  exclusively conducted in dollars. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=47.82s)]
*  What this means is that every country in the world needs a constant supply of dollars on [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=50.18s)]
*  hand to buy oil and other critical goods, and to acquire those dollars, they have to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=53.98s)]
*  manufacture real goods and sell them to the US or some other country that acquired dollars [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=58.699999999999996s)]
*  from the US. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  The United States, on the other hand, can print dollars, meaning they can essentially [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=64.38s)]
*  go into debt for free. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=67.92s)]
*  Economist Barry Eichengreen describes it as the following, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=69.66s)]
*  It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=71.78s)]
*  But other countries have to pony up $100 of actual goods and services in order to obtain one. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=76.82000000000001s)]
*  The other thing is that since the world financial system was set up by the US and relies so [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  heavily on the dollar, the US also has the power to exclude countries from the international [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=86.3s)]
*  financial system. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  The US controls SWIFT, the international payment system which basically functions as the blood [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=91.86s)]
*  vessels of the world financial system. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=96.34s)]
*  The US has weaponized SWIFT by banning countries it doesn't like from it, like Cuba, Iran, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=98.32s)]
*  and North Korea. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=102.8s)]
*  The US also takes advantage of the fact that many countries store their foreign reserves [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=103.8s)]
*  in US banks and dollar denominated assets. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=107.24s)]
*  The most brazen example of this was after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, when the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=110.0s)]
*  US froze over $600 billion of gold in foreign reserves held in US and EU banks, making Russia [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=114.0s)]
*  unable to pay its foreign debts. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  So how would a new BRICS currency change this? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  Well, the US has the power to print money and unilaterally exclude and punish countries [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=124.72s)]
*  because the world relies on the dollar. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=129.76s)]
*  But if enough countries make the collective decision to abandon the dollar and rally around [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=131.72s)]
*  new currencies that the US doesn't control, the US wouldn't have the power to manipulate [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=135.94s)]
*  the world financial system like it does now. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=140.28s)]
*  Skeptics often say that no currency will replace a dollar because not enough countries will [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=142.52s)]
*  adopt it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=146.57999999999998s)]
*  But the five BRICS countries alone represent a whopping 40% of the world's population. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  If you add the countries that are applying for BRICS membership, it becomes a little [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=152.24s)]
*  under half. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=155.46s)]
*  If all these countries started demanding BRICS currency in trade instead of the dollar, the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  rest of the world would likely have to lessen their foreign reserve holdings of US dollars [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  and increase their holdings of the new BRICS currency. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=165.24s)]
*  Other countries will also probably find the BRICS currency more appealing because it's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=167.9s)]
*  not controlled by a single country, unlike the dollar. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=171.28s)]
*  For centuries, the imperialist countries used their military and financial supremacy to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=174.06s)]
*  siphon off resources and labor out of the rest of the world. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=178.44s)]
*  Now those countries are banding together and starting their own currency, backed by that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=181.76s)]
*  same wealth of resources, which will dramatically reduce the value and relevance of Western [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=185.5s)]
*  fiat currencies. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=190.28s)]
*  While some are going to continue to insist that de-dollarization will never happen, many [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=191.28s)]
*  would argue that it's the current hegemonic position of the dollar that won't last, and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=195.62s)]
*  that a new financial system that reflects the new multipolar world was always bound [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=200.2s)]
*  to emerge. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJnpYszYLQA&t=204.39999999999998s)]
