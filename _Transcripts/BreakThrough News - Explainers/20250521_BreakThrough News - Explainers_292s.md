# Leaked Documents Reveal Trump Admin Plan To Destroy Palestine Movement
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0)
*  Trump's blueprint for shutting down the Palestine movement just got leaked, and it's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=0.0s)]
*  pretty revealing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  A reporter from the New York Times got her hands on a previously unseen policy paper [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  from the far-right think tank, the Heritage Foundation, the same think tank that spearheaded [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=9.52s)]
*  Project 2025, and created the blueprint for Trump's attack on universities. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=13.94s)]
*  The paper basically proposes the idea that the global movement against the Palestinian [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  genocide isn't a real movement of tens of millions of people, rather that it's a global [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=22.82s)]
*  undercover support network for Hamas, which they call the Hamas Support Network, or HSN. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=28.42s)]
*  They're doing all this so they can make the argument that the Department of Justice [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=34.78s)]
*  has the right to go after pro-Palestine groups for providing material support for terrorism, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=38.32s)]
*  a federal crime that comes with heavy prison sentences, the shutting down of bank accounts, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=43.74s)]
*  and the seizure of assets. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=48.14s)]
*  A number of Project Esther's proposals are almost identical to what the Trump administration [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=49.660000000000004s)]
*  has done to the Palestine movement since taking office, like canceling visas for foreign students [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=54.339999999999996s)]
*  that support Palestine, and withholding federal funds from institutions that don't enforce [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=59.22s)]
*  anti-Palestinian policies. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=63.34s)]
*  Some of the other proposals include deprioritizing pro-Palestine posts and social media algorithms, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=65.58s)]
*  sowing distrust between pro-Palestine groups, framing the Palestine movement as anti-American, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=70.7s)]
*  dissuading localities from issuing protest permits to the Palestine movement, and presenting [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=76.02s)]
*  the movement as criminal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=81.08s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation started writing this proposal after October 7th, and intended for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=82.7s)]
*  it to be implemented as soon as a willing administration took power, which they ended [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=87.16s)]
*  up getting with the Trump administration. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=91.10000000000001s)]
*  While there's no way to be 100% sure that they're using this proposal, one of the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=93.3s)]
*  co-authors of the proposal basically said as much, saying that it was quote, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=97.18s)]
*  No coincidence that we called for a series of actions to take place privately and publicly, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=101.26s)]
*  and they're now happening. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=106.42s)]
*  The Project Esther proposal was written by Victoria Coats, Robert Greenway, and Daniel [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  Flesch, who all work for Heritage. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=112.28s)]
*  The team also consulted with members of the National Security Council from the first Trump [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=114.86s)]
*  administration, and all three of the co-authors are extreme Zionists, tiding closely with [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  the U.S. national security state and the Israeli military. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Their team also traveled to Israel in late April, right around the peak of the global [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=126.8s)]
*  encampments movement, to discuss Project Esther with high-level Israeli officials, including [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=130.26s)]
*  the defense and foreign ministers. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=135.6s)]
*  For us at Breakthrough, all this hits really close to home. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=138.1s)]
*  This is the playbook they already used against Mahmoud Khalil, who we interviewed extensively, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=141.46s)]
*  and the Heritage Foundation also published a report last summer that identified Breakthrough [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  as a leader of the radical media wing of the ecosystem they've been lobbying to crush. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=150.22s)]
*  While the current repression is designed to make Israel look invincible, it's really [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  a sign of their weakness. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=159.38s)]
*  The fact that their arguments are descending into ever more paranoid and alarmist scare [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=161.0s)]
*  tactics is a tacit admission that they've lost the debate. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=164.94s)]
*  Just think about how ridiculous what they're saying really is. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=168.88s)]
*  They're saying that all of the people who have come out to protest the genocide—nurses, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=172.06s)]
*  software programmers, port workers, teachers, veterans, and high schoolers—are all part [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=177.34s)]
*  of a global clandestine network to support Hamas. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=183.44s)]
*  We used to joke that Israel would say that everyone they don't like is Hamas, but that's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=188.2s)]
*  actually the argument they're putting forward now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=192.94s)]
*  And it goes without saying that this is all obviously fabricated. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=195.86s)]
*  If they had any actual evidence that any of these groups were agents of Hamas, we would [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=199.38000000000002s)]
*  have seen it plastered in every newspaper and primetime TV show 24-7. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=204.12s)]
*  But we don't see that, because the evidence doesn't exist. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=210.0s)]
*  And while they attempt to paint pro-Palestine protesters as foreign agents, what Project [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=213.4s)]
*  Esther reveals is that it's the Trump administration and Congress who are coordinating directly [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=218.14000000000001s)]
*  with the foreign terrorist state and their extremist supporters in the United States. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=223.78s)]
*  Donald Trump won the election by pledging to end U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=228.18s)]
*  and framed himself as the pro-free speech, pro-constitution candidate. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=233.5s)]
*  But since taking office, he's appointed one of the most pro-Israel cabinets in recent [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=238.82s)]
*  memory, which is clearly just a gift to the Israel lobby groups that poured hundreds of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=243.7s)]
*  millions of dollars into his campaign and then allowed them to sweep away protestant [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=248.22s)]
*  speech rights in a matter of months. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=252.74s)]
*  Americans of all stripes, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, should see Project [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=256.02s)]
*  Esther as a fundamental threat to your rights. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=261.22s)]
*  It's not just about Palestine, because it sets the precedent that anyone who opposes [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=264.18s)]
*  the military-industrial complex, the current administration, or frankly any of the future [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=269.12s)]
*  administrations, can be labeled a terrorist, targeted as such, and be stripped of your [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=273.82s)]
*  right to free speech and assembly, have your access to money and public platforms seized, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=279.26s)]
*  and have your characters assassinated. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=284.5s)]
*  It's the Palestine movement for now, but by tomorrow, it could be you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8QKCfQHa0&t=286.53999999999996s)]
