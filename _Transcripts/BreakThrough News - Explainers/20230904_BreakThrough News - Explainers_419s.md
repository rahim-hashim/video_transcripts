Video Description: Itâ€™s time for a four-day workweek.
Workers fought and died to cap the working week at 40 hours. But that was back in the 19th century.
In the 21st century, when workers are more productive than ever before in history, the five-day workweek should get a much needed update.

# It's Time For a Four-Day Workweek
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [September 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs)
*  It is time for 4-Day Workweek. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=0.0s)]
*  The 5-Day Workweek was great when 6-Day Weeks and 10-Hour Shifts were the norm, but that [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=2.46s)]
*  was back in the 19th century. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=7.2s)]
*  In the 21st century, we need a new standard for what work looks like, one that actually [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=8.88s)]
*  reflects the reality of working conditions today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  First of all, I think it's pretty obvious that we work way too long. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=16.56s)]
*  I don't think I really need to say much on this besides the fact that you never really [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=19.34s)]
*  hear anyone complaining that the weekend is too long or that they'd rather be at their [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  job right now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  And on top of that, between weekend laundry and chores and errands, it's not like we're [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=27.36s)]
*  not doing work on the weekends. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=32.32s)]
*  Given all this, it should come as no surprise that the idea of a 4-Day Workweek is overwhelmingly [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=34.44s)]
*  popular. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=39.36s)]
*  In a recent survey conducted by Newsweek, 71% of American workers said they supported [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=40.36s)]
*  a 4-Day Workweek. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=45.16s)]
*  Notably, 22% were neutral on the idea, meaning only 3% were actually opposed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=46.6s)]
*  Another survey by Jobless, a company that helps workers find jobs, found that 94% of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=52.08s)]
*  workers want a 4-Day Workweek. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=57.04s)]
*  A Washington Post survey found that nearly twice as many workers preferred a 4-Day Week [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  to a 5-Day Week. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=63.12s)]
*  Now, there's going to be a very vocal minority out there that says if we have a 4-Day Workweek, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=64.12s)]
*  we'll become much less productive, that work won't get done, but this is just wrong. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=69.0s)]
*  In the largest 4-Day Workweek experiment to date, 3,300 workers in the UK had over 70 [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=74.16s)]
*  companies got a 4-Day Workweek for six months. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=80.0s)]
*  The study had a 180-100 model, meaning workers got 100% of the pay they normally get for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=82.56s)]
*  80% of the hours, and in exchange, they continue to put in 100% of the effort they usually [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=88.08s)]
*  put in. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  A staggering 95% of the companies that participated reported that productivity levels were the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  same or higher than they were under the 5-Day Workweek, and 92% of the companies that participated [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=99.4s)]
*  said they would make the 4-Day Workweek a permanent thing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=105.4s)]
*  On the employee side, 90% of workers said they wanted the 4-Day Workweek to continue, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=108.44s)]
*  55% said it increased their ability to work, and 15% even said no amount of money would [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=113.52s)]
*  get them to go back to the 5-Day Workweek. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=119.4s)]
*  In the words of one participant, the 4-Day Week simply makes you happy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  Speaking of which, let's think about the mental health benefits of this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=125.88s)]
*  So many people, especially young people, struggle with depression, anxiety, people have trouble [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=130.22s)]
*  focusing, they're stressed out, they have no sense of purpose. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=136.08s)]
*  How much of that do we think is rooted in our jobs? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=139.88000000000002s)]
*  Imagine what it would feel like if we had an extra day to go outside, or go to the gym, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=142.8s)]
*  or vacation, or be with friends and family. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=147.24s)]
*  In fact, you don't even need to imagine, because that experiment they did in the UK [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  showed a 54% reduction in negative emotions among participants. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=154.4s)]
*  71% of participants said they felt less burnout. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  The proof that a 4-Day Workweek is not only possible, but necessary, is overwhelming, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=162.08s)]
*  which is probably why there's a growing movement of people who are saying the time [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=168.24s)]
*  for this is right now. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  Bernie Sanders recently wrote an op-ed calling for a 32-hour workweek with no reduction in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=172.56s)]
*  pay. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  Sean Fain, the president of the United Auto Workers Union, one of the largest unions in [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  America, recently called for a 4-Day Workweek for UAW auto workers with a 46% pay increase. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=181.88000000000002s)]
*  A Pennsylvania state legislator is preparing to introduce a bill that would require large [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=188.2s)]
*  companies to reduce working hours from 40 to 32 without reducing pay. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=192.6s)]
*  It's not a coincidence that this is all happening right now. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=197.2s)]
*  One of the most basic laws of history is that technology is constantly improving, which [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=200.2s)]
*  allows us to do more with less. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=204.6s)]
*  For example, the world's first computer weighed 30 tons, took up 1,800 square feet [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=207.04s)]
*  of space, and required 186,000 kilowatts of power to do approximately 5,000 operations [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=212.02s)]
*  a second. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=218.62s)]
*  An iPhone 12 can do about 11 trillion operations per second, fits in your pocket, and you can [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=219.62s)]
*  pick one up right now for around 300 bucks. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=224.3s)]
*  You can see the same trend in digital storage, medical technology, TVs, or just about any [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=226.66000000000003s)]
*  electronics. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=232.18s)]
*  They get more powerful, smaller, and cheaper with time. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=233.18s)]
*  And when you think about the technology that's coming out today, AI technology, nanotechnology, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=236.9s)]
*  the Internet of Things, we may very well be headed for what could be a highly technological [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=242.18s)]
*  society where there's no longer a need for humans to toil away doing menial tasks. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=246.82s)]
*  This all begs a very simple question. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=252.22s)]
*  If technology has made the average worker way more productive than ever before in human [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=254.32s)]
*  history, why are we still working the same hours as workers from the 19th century? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=258.3s)]
*  If a worker today can produce in 20 hours what a worker 100 years ago could only produce [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=263.54s)]
*  in 40, why do we still work the same 40-hour work week? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=268.26000000000005s)]
*  The demand for a shorter work week isn't based on laziness or people's subjective [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=271.94s)]
*  desire to not work as long. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  It reflects the objective reality that we need a lot less labor hours to keep society [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=279.32000000000005s)]
*  functioning than we used to need. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=284.26s)]
*  Ending the 40-hour work week would also mean creating millions more jobs and massively [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  reducing unemployment. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=290.98s)]
*  Under the current model of work, employers squeeze their workers for as much labor as [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=292.64s)]
*  possible while trying to hire as few workers as possible, which is why, as workers, we're [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  constantly the victims of understaffing. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=302.68s)]
*  If the 40-hour work week was reduced and there's still more work to be done in society, employers [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=304.88s)]
*  would have to hire more people instead of working their existing employees to the bone. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=310.24s)]
*  There really aren't many arguments against a shorter work week, and it's clear that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=314.56s)]
*  workers overwhelmingly want one. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=318.56s)]
*  But beware of attempts by the ultra-rich to co-opt the meaning of a shorter work week [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=320.88s)]
*  as well. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=325.04s)]
*  For example, Richard Branson, a billionaire, advocates for a three-day work week. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=326.04s)]
*  Same goes for billionaire Carlos Slim. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=330.78s)]
*  You could easily see how the capitalist class might say, oh yeah, you want a four-day work [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  week? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=337.4s)]
*  That's fine, but if you only work for four days, that means you're only going to get [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=338.4s)]
*  four days' pay. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=341.52s)]
*  That's not the kind of four-day work week we're talking about. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=342.52s)]
*  That's the capitalists finding ways to reduce their labor costs under the guise of a shorter [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=345.28s)]
*  which would actually make it harder for workers to make ends meet. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=350.56s)]
*  The whole point of a four-day work week is that we work less without any reduction in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=353.32000000000005s)]
*  pay because modern technology allows us to produce more with less work. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=357.48s)]
*  If a four-day work week were to be implemented, it would have to be mandated by law that employers [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=362.12s)]
*  can't lower workers' weekly pay. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=366.88000000000005s)]
*  And don't even try to say that the capitalists can't afford it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=369.36s)]
*  The 1% share of wealth is higher than it's ever been. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  So to wrap up, I just want to say this. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=375.04s)]
*  There is so much more to life than work and productivity. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=378.36s)]
*  We as human beings have so much more to live for than how much money we can make for some [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=383.72s)]
*  company. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  We live in a world that's on the brink of such tremendous technological breakthroughs [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  that a post-scarcity future where there's an abundance of resources, where we no longer [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  need to break our backs to survive, is within sight. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=398.16s)]
*  We can apply the massive technological innovations of today to solve humanity's problems and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  massively reduce the need for menial human toil. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=407.84s)]
*  Or we can continue to live under a capitalist system where these technologies will take [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  our jobs and replace human labor. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=415.44s)]
*  It's our choice. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUnGkn_JHs&t=417.44s)]
