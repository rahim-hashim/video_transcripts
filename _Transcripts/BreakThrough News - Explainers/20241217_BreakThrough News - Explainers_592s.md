# If the New Jersey Drone Sightings Freak You Out, Wait Until You See What the Pentagon is Preparing
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU)
*  Here's what the media isn't saying about the New Jersey drone sightings. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=0.0s)]
*  In the last week, people across the East Coast, especially New Jersey, have been reporting [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=3.84s)]
*  seeing drones flying in the sky at night. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=8.16s)]
*  No one knows who's flying them or what they're doing, but they've caused a kind of mass [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  frenzy of speculation and fear. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=14.74s)]
*  Politicians have been scrambling to get answers, and some politicians, most notably Donald [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=18.02s)]
*  Trump, have been calling on the military to shoot them out of the sky. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=22.04s)]
*  New Jersey Congressman Jeff Van Drew even tried to float the idea that the drones were [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=26.48s)]
*  coming from an Iranian mothership off the eastern coast of the United States, a claim [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=30.64s)]
*  so outlandish that the Pentagon had to come out and dismiss it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=35.24s)]
*  But for all the non-stop talk of a foreign drone attack, no one's mentioning the fact [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=39.08s)]
*  that the United States military is actually the one quietly raising an army of autonomous [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=43.64s)]
*  killer robots. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=49.44s)]
*  Autonomous killer robots, known by their more formal name as lethal autonomous weapons systems [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=51.44s)]
*  or laws, are weapons that are able to identify, target, and engage enemies without any human [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=56.04s)]
*  involvement. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=62.28s)]
*  You think about conventional drones, like the ones that are used in drone strikes overseas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=63.42s)]
*  The vehicle itself has no cockpit or any human operator. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=67.96s)]
*  Instead, it's being operated remotely by a human pilot thousands of miles away who [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=71.28s)]
*  tells the vehicle where to fly and who to shoot. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=76.56s)]
*  But autonomous weapons don't even need that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=79.6s)]
*  Autonomous weapons run on AI algorithms, which essentially gives them a mind of their own. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=82.76s)]
*  You turn them on, and they go out and find and kill the enemy all on their own. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=87.84s)]
*  You've actually probably seen autonomous weapons before in shows like Black Mirror [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  without even knowing it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=96.44s)]
*  And despite dozens of Nobel laureates and over 30 countries calling for a global treaty [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  to ban these weapons, the US not only opposes a treaty like this, but is actively stoking [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  an arms race over this new technology. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  In 2023, the US Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks gave a speech to the National [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=110.88s)]
*  Defense Industrial Association, where she announced to a crowd of weapons manufacturing [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=117.0s)]
*  CEOs, the new Replicator Initiative, the Pentagon's new plan to deploy thousands of unmanned drones [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=121.36s)]
*  to multiple combat theaters in 18 to 24 months in an effort to give the US a military advantage [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  over China. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=133.28s)]
*  Her choice to unveil this new initiative at a weapons conference wasn't a coincidence. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=134.32s)]
*  The Replicator Initiative coincides with a new era of the Pentagon's alliance with [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=138.72s)]
*  private industry. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=142.58s)]
*  Near the end of her talk, Kathleen Hicks appealed to the companies that aren't part of the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=143.58s)]
*  traditional military-industrial complex to find their inner patriotism and help the Pentagon [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=147.6s)]
*  roll out this new plan. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=152.64s)]
*  Quite frankly, she didn't even need to ask. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=154.28s)]
*  Companies ranging from Amazon to Microsoft are lining up to create tech infrastructure [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=157.18s)]
*  for the Pentagon, the market for autonomous drones is expected to quadruple in the next [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=161.0s)]
*  decade. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=165.44s)]
*  Even this weekend, during the Army-Navy game while all this drone hysteria continued to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=166.44s)]
*  rage, Palantir, the massive data giant, aired a commercial romanticizing this new technology [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=170.88s)]
*  with the tagline, battles are won before they begin. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=176.96s)]
*  Hashtag Army-Navy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=180.44s)]
*  The military-industrial complex is looking at this new arms race like one massive gold [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=182.28s)]
*  rush. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=186.24s)]
*  To walk us through who the players are and just how dangerous these weapons can be, we [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=187.24s)]
*  spoke to Bill Hartung, a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute who's been researching [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=191.28s)]
*  the arms industry and US military spending for decades. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=195.64s)]
*  The whole theory is you want to reduce what they call the kill chain, like the time between [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=199.72s)]
*  when you see the target and when you can destroy it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=204.11999999999998s)]
*  And if there's a race to see how short that can be, eventually it doesn't make sense to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=207.0s)]
*  have humans in the loop because the other side will be faster if they just do it with [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=212.0s)]
*  robots essentially. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=217.92s)]
*  So that's the concern is that you're going to have these robotic wars which make war [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  more likely because you're not losing as many troops. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=224.28s)]
*  But also these things can malfunction because it's complex software. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=226.92s)]
*  You could kill large numbers of people by mistake. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=230.48s)]
*  If they were stupid enough to put it as part of the control system for nuclear weapons, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=233.66s)]
*  you could have a disaster on that front. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=239.44s)]
*  And also there's kind of this notion that this is some sort of technological miracle [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=241.76s)]
*  that's going to reestablish US global dominance. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=247.2s)]
*  Every generation they have a version of that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  There was electronic battlefield in Vietnam which failed. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  There was Reagan's impenetrable Star Wars shield which was penetrable. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=258.76s)]
*  They had all these precision guided munitions that were supposed to win the wars in Iraq [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=263.64s)]
*  and Afghanistan. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=267.8s)]
*  It's kind of a misunderstanding of the nature of warfare because it's not just about what [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=269.48s)]
*  kind of weapons you have. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=275.6s)]
*  It's morale. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=276.8s)]
*  A lot of these wars the people that the US is fighting are not going to give up ever. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  And so even though they make suffer significant losses at the end it's going to be a stalemate [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=285.24s)]
*  or the US is going to withdraw, essentially lose. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=290.04s)]
*  It's kind of like baked into the ideology of Washington partly because there's a lot [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  of money to be made. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=298.88s)]
*  Some of the Silicon Valley leaders like Palmer Lucky who runs this firm, Anderil, his initial [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=300.26s)]
*  pitch was he was going to save civilization by making cheaper weapons that would save [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=308.72s)]
*  the Pentagon money at the same time he was getting rich. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  And they write these manifestos about essentially saying they're better people because they're [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=318.04s)]
*  the disruptors, they're the makers and they can do things better than government. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=323.68s)]
*  Some of them seem to think we don't need a government because you don't want to stand [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  in the way of the smart capable people. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=332.36s)]
*  Government just gets in the way. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=336.16s)]
*  So it's an extreme form of libertarianism combined with almost like a messianic instinct. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=337.36s)]
*  Peter Thiel of Palantir is obsessed with making himself live forever and he's spending all [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=345.48s)]
*  this kind of money on it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=350.8s)]
*  They want to colonize space. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=351.8s)]
*  So people with these kind of unrealistic visions of what's possible, I don't really want them [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=353.48s)]
*  shaping our foreign policy. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  We're mainly talking about selling these weapons to the US military but you also foresee [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=363.2s)]
*  this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=367.4s)]
*  Do you think these companies also want to sell weapons to other actors potentially? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=368.4s)]
*  Oh absolutely. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=372.76s)]
*  They're building into their plans exports. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=373.76s)]
*  Some elements are already happening. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=379.11999999999995s)]
*  Some of the AI related surveillance stuff has been sold to Israel. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=382.4s)]
*  Things like Palantir which are the cutting edge of this emerging tech field has an office [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=386.64s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=392.91999999999996s)]
*  They're sort of viewing Israel and Ukraine as kind of test cases to show that their weapons [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  work. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=399.47999999999996s)]
*  That's sort of their advertising pitches. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah, look at what we've achieved. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=403.28s)]
*  And of course in Gaza Israel is committing war crimes against an adversary that doesn't [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  have anti-aircraft or anything really to counter in the moment. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=411.96s)]
*  And then there's this other thing, the whole idea of a China threat. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=416.96s)]
*  They don't really have the kind of military that you could use to project force to attack [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=422.35999999999996s)]
*  the United States unless they wanted to start World War III in which case they would also [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=427.71999999999997s)]
*  be devastated. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  They've built up, they want more regional capacity but they're not going to try to do [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  what the U.S. does. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  We have 800 military bases overseas. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=441.4s)]
*  They have three. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=443.88s)]
*  We have 13 times as many nuclear weapons as they do. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=445.36s)]
*  We have 12 or 13 aircraft carriers. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=448.96s)]
*  They have two. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=451.56s)]
*  So in a traditional contest there's no comparison. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=452.98s)]
*  Now if it moves into anti-satellite weapons and AI and swarms of drones then it's sort [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=457.04s)]
*  of like you reset the clock. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=464.16s)]
*  They do have a very strong technological base. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=467.32s)]
*  So it's like if they got pushed far enough perhaps they would run an arms race with the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=471.09999999999997s)]
*  U.S. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  But at the moment that's not the case. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=477.71999999999997s)]
*  Do you see a threat of this technology being used domestically? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=479.28s)]
*  I mean you see all this repression happening against the students. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=483.35999999999996s)]
*  All these police forces looking increasingly like a military, do you see a threat of that? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=486.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=493.47999999999996s)]
*  These companies are kind of all purpose purveyors of repression because they use their technology [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=494.92s)]
*  at the border. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=503.76s)]
*  Palantir sells things that are used for prescriptive policing where they try to profile somebody [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=505.56s)]
*  and figure out if they're going to commit a crime. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLxWhWX-aU&t=512.88s)]
