# Elon Musk Just Took Over The Treasury Department's Payment Systems
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo)
*  Elon Musk just got access to the Treasury Department's payment system. He can now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=0.0s)]
*  see every payment under the purview of the Bureau of Fiscal Services, a unit in the Treasury [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=4.96s)]
*  Department that processes nearly all $6 trillion that the federal government spends every year. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=10.16s)]
*  This isn't just department budgets or large government contracts. It also includes social [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  security payments, government salaries, basically anything the government spends money on. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=21.04s)]
*  Now, Elon Musk obviously isn't supposed to have access to this incredibly sensitive information. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=26.4s)]
*  The unit falls under the authority of the Treasury Department and the Department of Government [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  Efficiency, the name of the White House advisory team that Elon Musk is a part of, isn't even a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=36.4s)]
*  real executive agency. This, however, didn't stop Elon and the Doge team from pressuring the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=41.28s)]
*  Treasury official who was in charge of the Bureau to give them access. This official, David Lebrink, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=46.4s)]
*  was strong-armed, put on leave, and then resigned shortly after. Once he was gone, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=51.68s)]
*  the new Treasury Secretary, hedge fund billionaire and George Soros protege Scott Pesent, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=56.88s)]
*  made Elon and his team Treasury employees and gave them security clearances. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=62.08s)]
*  Another Silicon Valley executive, Tom Krause, the CEO of Cloud Software Group, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=67.68s)]
*  was also reportedly involved in pressuring the former Treasury official to give Doge access, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=72.32s)]
*  meaning there could be several more rich Silicon Valley executives trying to get their hands on, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=77.2s)]
*  or who already have gotten their hands on, this trove of sensitive data. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=82.48s)]
*  By the way, all we know about the Doge team so far is that they've hired a handful of 19- to 26-year-olds, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  many of whom are still in college. In other words, you now have a group of college students, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=93.68s)]
*  tech executives, and the world's richest person who were never elected, never had any experience [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=99.12s)]
*  aren't even part of a real government body with full access to some of the most sensitive [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=106.0s)]
*  information in the country. Congress can't intervene because Doge staff aren't public [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=111.12s)]
*  officials, so they're not accountable to a government body, and it's already being reported [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  that one Doge employee is rewriting the code for the Treasury's payment system, which contradicts [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=119.76s)]
*  earlier reports that Doge's access was read-only. Elon Musk has also stuffed the Government Services [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=125.12s)]
*  Administration and Office of Personnel Management, two of the most crucial bodies [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=131.12s)]
*  of the day-to-day operation of the government, with loyalist employees from his own companies. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=135.28s)]
*  It's hard to say exactly what Elon plans to do because the bureau he controls now encompasses the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=140.88s)]
*  entire federal government, but he tweets every hour about dismantling the federal government, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=146.16s)]
*  so there's that. But the point here is this latest move gives the Trump administration [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=150.88s)]
*  another way to illegally halt government programs and spending they don't like, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  which the administration already tried but was thwarted by the courts. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=160.32s)]
*  Now the Trump administration has loyalists in charge of the bureau that issues the payments [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=164.0s)]
*  for all of these agencies. We're going to keep following the story as it develops, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  but this should shatter any illusion that Elon Musk and this billionaire-run administration is [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  in any way some sort of populist government that's going to put the power back in the hands of the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=178.72s)]
*  people. It's literally the opposite. It's a coup by the world's richest men and a dozen other [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=183.84s)]
*  hedge-run billionaires who want to tear out every part of the government they don't like [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=190.32s)]
*  and make the rest their personal plaything. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQe4Qn4GNNo&t=194.56s)]
