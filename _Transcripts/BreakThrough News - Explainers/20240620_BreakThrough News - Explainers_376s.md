# China Just Cured a Patient’s Diabetes for the First Time. Why Haven't You Heard About It?
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ)
*  If you ever needed any more proof that the US government doesn't care about humanity, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=0.0s)]
*  China just cured type 2 diabetes for the first time ever, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=5.12s)]
*  and the US government is trying to pass legislation that would prevent US scientists from working with Chinese pharmaceuticals. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=8.72s)]
*  Diabetes is a massive crisis that no one talks about. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=15.36s)]
*  It's the eighth leading cause of death in the United States and killed 103,000 Americans in 2021. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=19.12s)]
*  That's more than four times the number of all the homicides in the US every year. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=25.04s)]
*  But you never hear politicians talking about, we gotta get tough on diabetes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=28.72s)]
*  Worldwide, 422 million people are affected by the disease. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=32.64s)]
*  Diabetes is caused by a deficiency of insulin, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=37.28s)]
*  usually because a person's pancreas, the organ responsible for creating insulin, isn't producing enough. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=40.32s)]
*  Until today, it had no known cure. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=45.84s)]
*  But last month, a group of Chinese scientists published a report about how they used stem cells to treat a diabetes patient. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=48.16s)]
*  They took the patient's blood cells and turned them into stem cells, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=54.96s)]
*  which they used to regenerate the patient's pancreas. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=58.32s)]
*  Stem cells are basically unassigned cells. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=60.88s)]
*  Brain cells are the building blocks of the brain, skin cells are what make up your skin, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=63.76s)]
*  but stem cells can become any kind of cell, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=67.92s)]
*  and when you place them near other cells, they turn into that kind of cell and multiply. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=70.48s)]
*  These scientists took the stem cells they made out of the patient's blood and used them to regenerate the patient's pancreatic tissue. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  The patient in the experiment, a 59-year-old man who had been living with type 2 diabetes for 25 years, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=81.2s)]
*  had been taking multiple insulin shots daily, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  but just 11 weeks after receiving the stem cell transplant, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  he no longer needed any insulin injections, meaning he's effectively cured. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=92.8s)]
*  This is a major breakthrough, and something the US has been trying to develop for some time now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=97.28s)]
*  The FDA approved for the first time cell therapy for diabetes patients, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=102.0s)]
*  but the cells in this treatment come from dead people, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=106.16s)]
*  and there aren't enough organ donors to treat everyone with diabetes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=108.72s)]
*  Point being, we should all be celebrating China's achievement, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=112.16s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, apparently not, because if you watch the mainstream media, you'd think we're supposed to hate China. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=118.32s)]
*  In the last few years, China has become the world leader in a lot of things, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  like electric vehicle production, green energy, public transportation, AI. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  Other countries have begun turning to China as a mediator in diplomatic relations, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=132.24s)]
*  a role traditionally filled by the US. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=136.16s)]
*  In 2010, China's economy became the second largest in the world, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=138.48s)]
*  and is now on track to outgrow the US economy as soon as 2030. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=142.16s)]
*  In other words, China is now powerful enough of a country [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=145.68s)]
*  that it threatens America's world superpower status, and America doesn't want to give that up. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=148.72s)]
*  In an effort to dampen their growth, the US has launched an all-out assault on Chinese industry [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=153.52s)]
*  with sanctions and tariffs, it's encircled China with US military bases, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=158.08s)]
*  armed with long-range missiles zeroed in on Chinese shores, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=162.24s)]
*  and one of its latest attacks is a bill called the BioSecure Act. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=165.28s)]
*  This bipartisan bill would ban any US business that receives federal funds [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  from working with four Chinese medical firms. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=173.36s)]
*  One of the companies listed, a Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturer called Wuxi, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  works with 19 of the 20 largest pharmaceutical manufacturers in the US. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=180.0s)]
*  One of the companies Wuxi works with, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=184.96s)]
*  cured a patient of the far less common type 1 diabetes, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=188.24s)]
*  and now they're scrambling to find alternative suppliers at the precise moment [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=191.44s)]
*  when you could have a collaboration that cures type 2 diabetes. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=195.12s)]
*  When you think about the implications of all this, it really calls into question [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=198.32s)]
*  the fundamental nature of our government. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  You have hundreds of thousands of people suffering and dying from a now curable disease, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=203.84s)]
*  and your own government is preventing you from working with the very country [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=209.28s)]
*  on the cutting edge of the cure, and instead spent hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=213.44s)]
*  to prepare to go to war with that country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=217.84s)]
*  The US has also been preventing the import of a Cuban miracle treatment for diabetic foot ulcers, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=220.0s)]
*  which we reported on two years ago, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=224.8s)]
*  a treatment that could have saved hundreds of thousands of people from having their body parts amputated. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=226.8s)]
*  Instead, the US government continues to impose a 60-year blockade on Cuba, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=231.76s)]
*  preventing medical collaboration almost entirely. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=236.16s)]
*  This is a bipartisan... [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=239.2s)]
*  It's really mind-boggling when you think about it, but then again, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=246.16s)]
*  these are the same people spending your tax dollars to blow up hospitals [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=249.28s)]
*  and murder Palestinian children. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=252.88s)]
*  So I guess it really shouldn't come as that much of a surprise. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=254.56s)]
*  Part of the reason for this is that the same way that all of the members of Congress [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=257.68s)]
*  that are so gung-ho about supporting Israel are actually taking money from Israel, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=261.36s)]
*  the people in our government that are sanctioning Chinese medical institutions [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=266.0s)]
*  are taking millions of dollars in bribes from a for-profit medical industry [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=269.44s)]
*  that makes billions of dollars from treating, but not curing, diabetes. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=273.44s)]
*  Insulin, like all medicine under capitalism, is a commodity that's bought and sold for profit. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=277.92s)]
*  Up until recently, health care companies were marking up insulin treatments as much as 5,000%. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=283.04s)]
*  A vial of insulin, which costs about $10 to make, would go for around $300 on the drug market. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=288.48s)]
*  People were literally dying because they couldn't afford to buy enough insulin [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=295.68s)]
*  and tried rationing what little they could afford. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=299.76s)]
*  This makes no sense if your goal is maximizing human well-being, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=302.16s)]
*  but it makes perfect sense if your goal is maximizing profit. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=306.0s)]
*  The pharmaceutical industry spends the most money lobbying Congress of any industry by far. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  In other countries, paying a member of the government to change the law on your behalf [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=314.96s)]
*  is called bribery, and it's illegal. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  In America, it's called lobbying, and there are rules and regulations that tell you exactly how to do it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=320.88s)]
*  The cost of U.S. hostility towards China isn't just that our politicians are dragging us into a war [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=326.0s)]
*  of unbelievably catastrophic proportions. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  It's also the cost of everything we lose when we choose a policy of ruthless confrontation [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=334.24s)]
*  and delinking over mutually beneficial cooperation. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  Instead of sanctioning Chinese scientists, we could be developing cures for diabetes and cancer together. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=342.56s)]
*  Instead of fear-mongering about the use of Chinese train cars in the U.S., [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  China could help us build high-speed rail all across the country [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=352.16s)]
*  given that they have the most highly developed high-speed rail system in the world. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=356.24s)]
*  In this highly technological age, when we could be coming together as a planet [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=360.16s)]
*  to apply science and technology to make disease, poverty, suffering, and war a thing of the past, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=364.16s)]
*  the best our politicians and the capitalist system can come up with is war with China. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cwP6-07tiQ&t=370.24s)]
