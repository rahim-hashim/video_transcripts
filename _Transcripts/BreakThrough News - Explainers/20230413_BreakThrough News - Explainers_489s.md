Video Description: De-dollarization is coming.
From China and France signing a natural gas deal in Chinese yuan, to BRICS announcing a new gold and commodity-backed currency, the dollar's reign is in crisis.
BT's Kei Pritsker explains who is de-dollarizing and how it could de-throne the dollar:

# De-dollarization Is Inevitable and Rapidly Approaching. Hereâ€™s What It Means
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [April 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds)
*  D-dollarization is coming. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=0.0s)]
*  Politicians in the U.S. are already freaking out about the prospect that they won't be [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=2.0s)]
*  able to punish other countries using the supremacy of the dollar. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=5.4s)]
*  Brazil, in our hemisphere, largest country in the Western Hemisphere south of us, cut [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=8.76s)]
*  a trade deal with China. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=13.3s)]
*  They're going to from now on do trade in their own currencies, get right around the dollar. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=14.56s)]
*  They're creating a secondary economy in the world totally independent of the United States. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=18.76s)]
*  We won't have to talk about sanctions in five years because there'll be so many countries [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=24.04s)]
*  transacting in currencies other than the dollar that we won't have the ability to sanction them. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=27.8s)]
*  You've probably heard people say D-dollarization will be the beginning of the end for U.S. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=32.28s)]
*  hegemony and bring about an entirely new global financial system that replaces the dollar. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  And as crazy as that might sound, it's not only likely, but there are already dozens [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=40.8s)]
*  of countries working to make this a reality. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=44.72s)]
*  To understand why the dollar's dominance could be ending, first we need to understand [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=46.96s)]
*  how it became so dominant to begin with. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=50.44s)]
*  For over a hundred years, the British Empire imposed an international financial system [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=52.68s)]
*  where the British pound functioned as the World Reserve currency. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=56.8s)]
*  A World Reserve currency is used as the standard in all international trade and is usually [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=59.76s)]
*  the currency of the dominant power of the time. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  Controlling the World Reserve currency conferred huge privileges to the British, but this changed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=66.72s)]
*  during World War II. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=71.06s)]
*  During the war, Britain had to let most of its colonies go because it had to dedicate [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  all of its resources to fighting the war. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=76.24s)]
*  Britain itself was also relentlessly bombed during the war and most of its cities and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=78.52s)]
*  factories were destroyed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=82.52s)]
*  In fact, basically every country involved in the war was seriously set back. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=84.0s)]
*  Every country except the United States. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=88.04s)]
*  The US mainland was never attacked, and it spent most of the war building up its industrial [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=90.2s)]
*  capacity. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=94.36s)]
*  The United States not only emerged from the war intact, but also the sole capitalist superpower. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=95.36s)]
*  The United States used the crisis of the war to recreate a new world financial system in [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=100.56s)]
*  what was called the Bretton Woods Agreement. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=105.28s)]
*  According to the agreement, the dollar would be the new World Reserve currency. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  This gave the US tremendous financial power because all of a sudden, everyone needed the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=110.92s)]
*  US's currency to buy and sell things, making the dollar the most needed and sought after [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=115.6s)]
*  currency in the world. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=120.2s)]
*  It was agreed that the dollar would be exchangeable for gold at a rate of $35 per ounce. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=121.92s)]
*  In theory, this prevented the US from just printing money because the US would have to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=126.54s)]
*  keep enough gold on hand to honor the exchange rate and gold can't be printed. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=130.4s)]
*  However, when it came down to it, the US broke its promise anyway. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=134.68s)]
*  In the 1960s, it became clear that the US was printing way more dollars than it actually [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=138.44s)]
*  had in gold. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=142.92s)]
*  French President Charles de Gaulle said the following, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  The fact that many countries accept as principle the dollar as good as gold leads Americans [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=146.84s)]
*  to get into debt and to get into debt for free at the expense of other countries, because [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=151.6s)]
*  with the US owes them, it is paid at least in part with dollars they are the only ones [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=156.24s)]
*  allowed to emit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=161.18s)]
*  As the US entered an inflationary crisis, countries started to demand their gold back. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=162.36s)]
*  In order to stop the bleeding, the Nixon administration suspended the convertibility [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=167.02s)]
*  of the dollar into gold in 1971. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=171.12s)]
*  The US kept the gold and left the rest of the world holding dollars. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=174.34s)]
*  In order to keep the world beholden to the dollar, the US negotiated a secret deal with [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=177.86s)]
*  the Saudi monarchy in 1973, where the US would offer Saudi Arabia military protection and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=182.06s)]
*  in return, Saudi Arabia would only sell its oil in dollars. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=187.9s)]
*  Since oil is the most traded commodity in the world, requiring the dollar for oil purchases [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  essentially made the dollar a prerequisite for international trade. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=196.7s)]
*  Economist Barry Eichengreen sums up just how beneficial this arrangement really was. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=200.61999999999998s)]
*  Quote, It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a hundred [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=205.54s)]
*  dollar bill, but other countries have to pony up a hundred dollars of actual goods and services [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=210.33999999999997s)]
*  in order to obtain one. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=215.66s)]
*  The other aspect of this is since the entire world financial system is based around institutions [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=217.22s)]
*  created by the US, the US uses this to punish countries it doesn't like. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=222.1s)]
*  For example, the US controls SWIFT, the digital payment system that's akin to the blood [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=227.1s)]
*  vessels of the world financial system. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=232.0s)]
*  The US has unilaterally banned countries like Cuba, Iran, and North Korea from SWIFT, essentially [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=234.0s)]
*  forbidding them from conducting international trade. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=239.42s)]
*  The US also leverages foreign countries' stockpiles of US dollars against them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=242.16s)]
*  For example, when Russia invaded Ukraine, the US froze over $600 billion of gold in [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=246.3s)]
*  foreign reserves held in US and EU banks, making Russia unable to pay its foreign debts. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=252.22s)]
*  Regardless of how you feel about Russia, US control over the world financial system allows [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=257.58s)]
*  the US to intervene in any conflict on earth and financially ruin the side they oppose. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=262.2s)]
*  This is the complete opposite of the free trade and political neutrality the US promised [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=267.5s)]
*  when it built this globalized financial architecture. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  This arrangement is obviously incredibly beneficial to the US elites, but there's [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=275.1s)]
*  only one problem. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=279.42s)]
*  The system only works if the rest of the world, especially oil-bearing states, continue to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=280.86s)]
*  use the dollar. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=286.14000000000004s)]
*  This came up, for instance, with Momor Gaddafi, who just two years prior to the US-led carpet [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=287.26000000000005s)]
*  bombing of Libya, proposed the creation of a single gold-backed African currency called [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  the dinar. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=297.66s)]
*  An email leaked by Wikileaks on Hillary Clinton's email server explicitly mentions Gaddafi's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=298.66s)]
*  for the gold-backed dinar as one of the reasons for intervening. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=304.38s)]
*  Iran, another big oil state, is under one of the worst US sanctions regimes in the world. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=307.18s)]
*  And Venezuela, who not only has the largest petroleum reserves in the world, but has also [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=312.86s)]
*  made several moves to sell its oil in alternative currencies, was the victim of a US-backed [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=317.16s)]
*  coup attempt in 2019 where taking Venezuela's oil was discussed casually as one of the central [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=321.82s)]
*  motivations. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  So if you think of a company like Citgo, which is owned by Petevesa, which is the state-run [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=328.82s)]
*  oil company there in Venezuela, we have a lot of those Citgo assets right here in the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=333.65999999999997s)]
*  US. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=339.34s)]
*  Is that something, for example, sir, that you're looking at? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=340.34s)]
*  Yeah, well, we're in conversation with major American companies now that are either in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=342.38s)]
*  Venezuela or in the case of Citgo here in the United States. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  It'll make a big difference to the United States economically if we could have American [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=351.14s)]
*  oil companies really invest in and produce the oil capabilities in Venezuela. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=355.78s)]
*  It'd be good for the people of Venezuela. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=362.26s)]
*  It'd be good for the people of the United States. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=363.85999999999996s)]
*  Despite the US's repeated attempts to maintain its supremacy over the world financial system, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=365.65999999999997s)]
*  more and more countries are setting up agreements to do trade in their local currencies and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=370.61999999999995s)]
*  gold instead of the dollar. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=373.9s)]
*  It would take too long to go through each example, so here's a list of countries that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=375.82s)]
*  have moved to de-dollarize in the last year. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=379.58s)]
*  Some notable examples here are France and China settling their first liquefied natural [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=385.78s)]
*  gas contract in Chinese Yuan, followed by French President Emmanuel Macron saying that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=393.94s)]
*  Europe needs to lessen its dependence on the dollar. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=398.38s)]
*  India recently announced that it would no longer require the US dollar in foreign trade. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=401.38s)]
*  Argentina and Brazil announced plans to create a common currency for South America called [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=405.14s)]
*  the sur. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=409.02s)]
*  At the top of the agenda of the recent ASEAN meeting, a grouping of 10 Southeast Asian [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=410.02s)]
*  was to quote, reduce dependence on the US dollar, euro, yen and British pound from financial [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=415.04s)]
*  transactions and move to settlements in local currencies. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=420.6s)]
*  One of the most notable examples is BRICS announcing that they'll be developing plans [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=424.48s)]
*  for a new currency at their next meeting, a currency that'll be backed by gold and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=428.42s)]
*  other crucial commodities. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=432.16s)]
*  BRICS is something like a rival to the Western G7 alliance and stands for Brazil, Russia, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=433.64000000000004s)]
*  India, China and South Africa. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=438.48s)]
*  This year, BRICS is set to expand with possible new members including Algeria, Saudi Arabia, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=440.68s)]
*  Argentina, Iran, Turkey and the UAE. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=445.92s)]
*  This plan for a new currency begs the question, why would the world continue to use the dollar [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  when the dollar is used as a weapon against the ones who use it? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=453.36s)]
*  The great irony of the dollar standard is that it forces all of the countries that are [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=456.86s)]
*  rich in resources and labor to hand over their real wealth in exchange for pieces of paper [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=460.56s)]
*  that cost a few cents to print. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=465.5s)]
*  When the US suspended the dollar's convertibility into gold in 1971, then Treasury Secretary [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=467.36s)]
*  John Connolly shocked reporters when he said, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=472.72s)]
*  Now the world is waking up and saying, this is our wealth you want. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's your problem. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HF5ep0QGds&t=482.72s)]
