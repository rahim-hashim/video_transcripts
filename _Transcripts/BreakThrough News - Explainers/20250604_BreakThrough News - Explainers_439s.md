# NATOâ€™s Dayton Summit Reveals Everything Wrong with U.S. War Spending
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU)
*  Trump positioned himself in the campaign as the candidate against military intervention [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=0.0s)]
*  He even criticized NATO saying that it was a drain on taxpayer dollars. Oh, he's violating NATO [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=4.2s)]
*  You know the biggest problem I have with NATO. I really if the United States was in trouble [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=10.14s)]
*  And we called them. Do you think they're gonna come and protect us? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=15.6s)]
*  But as president Trump has created the largest military budget in US history. That's one trillion dollars [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=19.36s)]
*  He sent weapons to Israel and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=25.36s)]
*  And he's left NATO completely untouched and the areas of the country that Trump promised would be revitalized [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=28.12s)]
*  Haven't seen a thing and no place better embodies that contradiction than where we are right now Dayton, Ohio [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=33.72s)]
*  NATO chose this city to host the spring parliamentary assembly [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=40.24s)]
*  But the contradictions couldn't be clearer the streets of Dayton, Ohio are littered with abandoned homes even burned out homes [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=43.64s)]
*  Programs across the board for working-class families are being cut [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  The city embodies the rust belt being one of the epicenters of the opioid epidemic in the country [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=52.64s)]
*  Dayton is is abandoned. I mean it feels like it goes down when I think back to growing up here [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=58.4s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's like it's very heart-wrenching to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=65.36s)]
*  friends your family [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=69.48s)]
*  Died, you know, there'll be a epidemic [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=71.92s)]
*  I'm a strong believer of you are what you see in your environment [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  If you send these kids to an area where are you see as drug uses, you know [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=80.44s)]
*  You got people fighting and you got a lot of these things down there [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=85.2s)]
*  What do you expect them to do? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=87.52s)]
*  And we're doing every can't everything we can to make it a better city to you know [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=88.8s)]
*  Make the place we live a better place [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=92.12s)]
*  But it's really kind of a hollowed out shell of what it used to be all that's left is a lot of abandoned buildings [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of poverty [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=98.0s)]
*  It's hard for people to find jobs where there is work and probably doesn't pay as much as a might in another city [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=99.08s)]
*  People are really struggling to get by here [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=103.64s)]
*  So just to see all this money being spent on NATO and not our own communities is hard to see [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=105.32s)]
*  nine million dollars [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  That's what Dayton, Ohio has spent to host NATO war planners in the city [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=112.52s)]
*  We spoke with locals to share their feelings on this massive spending and to learn more about how the militarization of the city [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=116.28s)]
*  impacted residents a lot of the people that are homeless in the downtown Dayton area were [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=122.1s)]
*  displaced because of the NATO village right and a lot of them are veterans as a veteran [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=127.56s)]
*  It really makes me upset seeing how much money is going from Dayton just to put into security [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=133.56s)]
*  They are using our tax dollars here to put up these [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=140.92s)]
*  Ridiculous fences to put to bring so many police to show force [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  When we need money for infrastructure, we need money for health care. We need housing. We need [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=152.32s)]
*  Union jobs to stay here in Dayton veterans just like anyone else [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=159.14s)]
*  We just aren't getting what we need in order to thrive here [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=163.42s)]
*  How can we spend millions of dollars protecting 300 people in our community? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=167.7s)]
*  When the kids don't even have school buses to get safely from school back and forth to school [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=172.26s)]
*  By kids coming downtown Dayton in order to get to school [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=176.7s)]
*  Sometimes when they get out of school, they have to wait 30 minutes to an hour just to get home [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=179.98s)]
*  Residents say the extra security for the NATO event led to the police harassing and tasing young people on the first night of the summit [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=184.18s)]
*  We have police down here shooting kids with mace ball guns [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=190.42s)]
*  Slamming kids on their stomachs and backs and everything all because it was a large group of them and it was arguments going on [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=194.06s)]
*  And I get that you got to separate the arguments and stuff [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=200.02s)]
*  You got to separate that to call to make sure that don't let the major happen. But my thing is [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=202.62s)]
*  Why are you using forces like that on check on kids? It is illegal in Ohio to tase a child [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=207.62s)]
*  And up to two kids was tased that day [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=213.5s)]
*  The Trump administration claims that there's no money for Medicaid and there's no money for programs that working-class people actually depend on [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=215.7s)]
*  But annually the US spends 3.5 billion dollars on NATO and that's part of the 1 trillion dollars already spent for defense budgets [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=222.02s)]
*  One in six people in Ohio have no idea where their next meal is going to come from [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=230.54s)]
*  Thousands of children are facing cuts to their Head Start programs and even more are facing potential cuts to the SNAP benefits program [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=234.54s)]
*  Growing up in the Dayton area you hear a lot about how great Dayton used to be how it was a big up-and-coming [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  Industrial city but living here now that's really not something you see. After deindustrialization when factories across the board shut down [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=246.22s)]
*  Cities in the Rust Belt experienced significant depopulation as millions of people left to find work [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=253.7s)]
*  For Dayton almost 50% of the population has left leading to abandoned neighborhoods and extreme economic struggles [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=259.1s)]
*  Over 30% of people in Dayton are currently living in poverty [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=265.58s)]
*  There's so many parts of Dayton, you know [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=268.74s)]
*  They call this the Rust Belt because it's been largely abandoned the infrastructure is crumbling the streets are crumbling [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=271.18s)]
*  People are crumbling people can barely survive here [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=277.21999999999997s)]
*  We just feel left behind by the government like you they use you and then they cast you aside and then they they treat you like [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=280.74s)]
*  You're crazy [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=288.62s)]
*  Especially when you're standing up against them despite these horrible conditions the people of the Rust Belt are fighting back [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=290.62s)]
*  Our school sizes are being increased and whole buildings are closed across the state due to budget cuts while mold grows on my [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=298.74s)]
*  Classroom ceilings and we can't afford to pay teachers in the rural American schools a living wage [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=306.06s)]
*  This president wants to send your tax dollars to more war across the globe [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=312.7s)]
*  We came from all across Ohio. We came even all across the United States to say [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=319.34s)]
*  We reject a political and economic system that prioritizes militarism over the needs of the people and our planet [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=325.28s)]
*  And that's why we're here to say abolish NATO [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=333.96s)]
*  I'm here at the People's Assembly where people across the country have gathered to counter NATO's parliamentary assembly [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=339.28s)]
*  Today we stand shoulder to shoulder [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  knocking at the door of one of the most prolific one of the most deadly one of the most [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=348.2s)]
*  Undemocratic tools of US Empire its name is NATO [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=354.24s)]
*  Politicians in the corporate media say that our money goes to NATO to be an instrument of peace around the world [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=359.48s)]
*  But since its founding NATO has been an instrument of war and US imperialism [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=364.56s)]
*  NATO was started as a so-called defensive military alliance was supposedly formed to defend against the Soviet Union during the Cold War [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=369.2s)]
*  But when the Cold War ended NATO was not disbanded [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=376.44s)]
*  It was actually expanded which brings us back to why Dayton was chosen to host this year's assembly [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=379.8s)]
*  30 years ago the Dayton agreement was signed here with NATO supervision supposedly to end the wars in Bosnia [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=384.56s)]
*  It's an odd thing to celebrate because that agreement set the stage for years more of war in the Balkans and a whole new era [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=389.96s)]
*  Of interventions worldwide with a supposed humanitarian fig leaf this year's summit in Dayton raised the most fundamental questions [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=396.24s)]
*  Who does NATO really serve and what is collective security? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=403.28s)]
*  Is it the real security of having food shelter and health care or the spectacle of billion-dollar weapons contracts? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=406.92s)]
*  Had a fireworks display the other day that must have caught quite cost quite a bit of money [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=414.0s)]
*  They explicitly said they didn't give people advance warning because they didn't want people to come because they didn't want to spend money to staff [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=418.28s)]
*  security for a crowd to watch it meanwhile they have hundreds if not thousands of [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=424.04s)]
*  Police and soldiers here to keep the people out of our own city [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=428.64s)]
*  You [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He5gLBXVbRU&t=436.44s)]
