# Remove That Buccal Fat! The Big Money Behind The Alarming New Surgery Trend
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [February 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0)
*  If you're a woman on the internet, you probably just learned what buckle fat is for the first time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=0.0s)]
*  Black top, big t-shirt, Billy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  My ladies to show off their jawline. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=6.8s)]
*  I just woke up so I thought I'd give an update. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Buckle fat removal surgery is the latest beauty trend being shoved down women's throats. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=14.08s)]
*  It's when a surgeon removes someone's buckle fat pads, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=19.36s)]
*  which is just a fancy way of saying the fat on your cheeks. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Almost overnight, the popularity of this procedure has skyrocketed, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=25.04s)]
*  especially on social media. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=28.88s)]
*  While most women were blissfully unaware that buckle fat even existed, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=30.48s)]
*  celebrities like Chrissy Teigen were getting the fat removed from their cheeks [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=34.08s)]
*  and proudly telling the internet all about it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=37.2s)]
*  The hashtag buckle fat removal has over 157 million views on TikTok, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=39.28s)]
*  and Google Trends data shows that searches for buckle fat removal have shot up dramatically. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=44.48s)]
*  One surgeon quoted by the New York Times said that he does three times as many buckle fat removals [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  as he did five years ago and now charges $40,000 for the procedure. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  Immediately after this trend began, women on social media described feeling insecure [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  about the size of their cheeks. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=63.2s)]
*  Some women even said they felt totally fine with their cheeks until seeing these videos. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=64.4s)]
*  While this is just the latest trend encouraging women to alter their bodies, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=68.08s)]
*  the pressure for women to conform to beauty ideals is nothing new. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=71.6s)]
*  These procedures go in and out of style, just like fashion trends. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=75.44s)]
*  But arguably the best example of this is the Brazilian butt lift. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  The popularity of this procedure coincided almost perfectly with Kim Kardashian's rise to fame. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=82.64s)]
*  The number of BBLs performed internationally rose 77% from 2015 to 2019 [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=87.6s)]
*  at a time when Kim Kardashian's butt had become a full-fledged cultural fixation. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  It was the subject of countless interviews. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=98.0s)]
*  People were so obsessed with her butt that Kim Kardashian even tried to prove [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  that her butt was natural with an x-ray on her show. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  When Kim suddenly appeared looking much thinner, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=106.88s)]
*  people immediately started speculating that the BBL era would end. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=109.52s)]
*  This goes to show how these trends blatantly contradict each other. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=113.52s)]
*  One day thin is in, then the next day it's BBLs, and then back to thin again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=117.04s)]
*  There's literally no way to win. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  This has a direct impact on the way women perceive themselves. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  80% of teen girls said they compare themselves to celebrities, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  half of whom said doing so makes them feel bad about their own appearance. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  Another study showed that nearly half of 13-year-old American girls [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=134.72s)]
*  said they were dissatisfied with their bodies. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=138.72s)]
*  By age 17, this number increased to 80%. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=140.72s)]
*  One study found that 40% of 9- and 10-year-old girls have tried to lose weight. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=144.8s)]
*  And of course this is going to happen. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=150.16s)]
*  These standards aren't naturally achievable. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  But that's completely by design. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=154.56s)]
*  There's a multi-billion dollar industry that's built on manufacturing new insecurities [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=156.56s)]
*  and then selling women the cure. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=161.76s)]
*  The cosmetic surgery industry says, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=163.44s)]
*  your natural features are flawed, but if you do this procedure, we can fix it for you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=165.52s)]
*  Don't believe me? Just check out the financial press. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=170.16s)]
*  You can find all kinds of articles talking about how cosmetic surgery [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=173.36s)]
*  could be the next big investment opportunity. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=177.04s)]
*  A report by researchandmarkets.com projects the global cosmetic surgery industry [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=179.84s)]
*  to go from $67 billion in 2021 to $201 billion by 2031. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=184.16s)]
*  Another article by Focus Investment Banking, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=191.12s)]
*  a financial advisory group composed of 37 mostly male bankers, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=193.68s)]
*  were drooling over what they called the new private equity darling we should have noticed sooner. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=198.0s)]
*  The article explains how both investors and surgeons [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=203.12s)]
*  can profit off of the cosmetic surgery's increasing popularity. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=205.84s)]
*  The article even laments that the surgeries are currently limited to specific areas of the body, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  but sees an opportunity to profit by broadening the practice's footprints. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=213.76s)]
*  Now why do you think a bunch of male bankers [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=218.08s)]
*  are so obsessed with cosmetic practices targeted at women? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=220.24s)]
*  And as this article explains, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=223.52s)]
*  the surgeons also have a financial incentive to push plastic surgery trends onto young girls. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  Cosmetic surgeons rely heavily on branding themselves as relatable and trustworthy. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=230.72s)]
*  In fact, a survey of cosmetic surgeons found that the top concern for patients [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=236.08s)]
*  was whether or not they could trust their doctor. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=240.0s)]
*  And as every successful marketer knows, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  there's no better place to build trust in your brand [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=244.32s)]
*  with thousands of potential new customers than social media. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=246.48s)]
*  Are you ready for your operation, Mr. Subiyat? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=249.68s)]
*  As ready as I'll ever be. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=251.92s)]
*  There's been a huge surge of plastic surgeon influencers [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=253.52s)]
*  who use TikTok to promote their brand. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=256.56s)]
*  One Business Insider article following this trend quotes Dr. Kim Patrick Murray, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=258.4s)]
*  who says that he saw a huge spike in business after starting his social media page. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=262.56s)]
*  There's also an entire marketing industry cropping up around these plastic surgeons, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=266.64s)]
*  who make their money by advising these surgeons on how to go viral on TikTok. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=270.64s)]
*  One company, SagaPixel, writes in their guide that the best strategy for TikTok [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=274.79999999999995s)]
*  is to promote surgeries that appeal most to younger audiences. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=278.88s)]
*  Studies show that a third of all users on the platform are under 19. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  Business Insider even ran an experiment where they created an account and set the age to 14 [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=286.64s)]
*  to see how long it would take before plastic surgery videos appeared. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=291.84s)]
*  It took eight minutes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  But what these videos won't tell you is that buckle fat naturally goes away over time, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=297.12s)]
*  meaning many of those getting their buckle fat removed will look incredibly gaunt as they age. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=302.0s)]
*  With some surgeries, the complications can be even worse. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=306.4s)]
*  There have been several instances of patients dying after getting Brazilian butt lifts. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=309.6s)]
*  A 2017 report found that 3% of surgeons had a patient die after a BBL. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=314.24s)]
*  But the cosmetic surgery industry is just one of many players in the beauty industry [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=319.36s)]
*  that profits off of women's insecurities. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=324.48s)]
*  What's the difference between saying your cheeks are too round and saying your eyebrows are too thin, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  or your lips are too pale, or your skin tone is uneven? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=331.76s)]
*  I mean, isn't the concept behind contouring the same concept behind buckle fat removal? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=335.68s)]
*  The underlying message is the same. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=340.64s)]
*  Your natural features aren't good enough. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=342.48s)]
*  This is the message repeated in the corporate media. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  Add nauseam. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=347.92s)]
*  Women are bombarded at every turn with made-up flaws and unrealistic beauty standards, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  and then offered a cure in the form of some product, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=354.24s)]
*  whether it's makeup, diet regimens, or a $40,000 buckle fat reduction. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=357.36s)]
*  If you want to understand where these unrealistic beauty standards are coming from, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  just follow the money. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  The beauty industry shells out millions of dollars [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=367.92s)]
*  just to get your favorite celebrity to hold a tube of lipstick for five seconds [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=370.48s)]
*  so that you'll be more likely to buy it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=374.48s)]
*  And a lot of the time, it works. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=376.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=379.04s)]
*  Think about any depiction you see of women in movies, or music videos, or magazine covers. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=380.0s)]
*  Anywhere you look in the media, you see the same thing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=385.04s)]
*  A thin woman with an hourglass figure who always looks flawless. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  Even if she's just rolled out of bed, her hair is perfect. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  She has a full face of makeup on. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=394.0s)]
*  Even when she's running or fighting, she never sweats. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=395.44s)]
*  Her legs are shaved, and she's wearing the least practical outfit you could imagine. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=398.88s)]
*  What kind of message does this send to young women? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  The most important thing about you is your appearance. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=405.28s)]
*  You won't be taken seriously unless you look like these women. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=408.4s)]
*  This literally determines how women spend their time and money. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=411.92s)]
*  A survey taken in 2014 showed that adult women spend 335 hours on their appearance per year. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=415.28s)]
*  For teen girls, it's 402 hours. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=421.52s)]
*  The study also showed 68% of adult women and 71% of teen girls put on makeup as part of their daily routine. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=424.16s)]
*  Now, it's true that some women enjoy putting on makeup. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  That's not the problem here. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=434.08000000000004s)]
*  The point is that large numbers of women are doing this because they feel obligated to. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=435.36s)]
*  Studies show that your decision to wear makeup directly impacts your income. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=440.32000000000005s)]
*  One study showed that women who spent more time on hair and makeup earned more on average than women who didn't. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=444.32000000000005s)]
*  Another study showed that the choice to wear makeup influences how women are perceived in a job interview. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=449.6s)]
*  Maybe this is why one third of women say they would never leave the house without makeup. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=454.88s)]
*  These decisions are clearly driven by the potential that women may face negative consequences for not wearing makeup. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=459.20000000000005s)]
*  One study says that women spend an average of a quarter of a million dollars on beauty practices in their lifetime. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliCBEKImt0&t=465.28000000000003s)]
