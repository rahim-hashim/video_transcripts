# Wall Street Vultures Are Preying on Puerto Rico's Energy Crisis, Enraging an Island.
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [July 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s)
*  Puerto Ricans are facing a power grid nightmare and U.S. corporate greed is to blame. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=0.0s)]
*  People are leaving the island because they can't pay for electricity. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Puerto Rican activists gathered outside a federal court in New York City to protest [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=11.76s)]
*  Golden Tree, the Wall Street Bolter Fund that's trying to profit off of Puerto Rico's energy [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=15.56s)]
*  crisis. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=20.2s)]
*  Puerto Rico was already suffering from an outdated electrical grid when it was battered [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=21.2s)]
*  by Hurricane Maria in 2017. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=25.2s)]
*  When the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority went bankrupt, Golden Tree moved in and bought [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=27.8s)]
*  up its cheap bonds. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=31.84s)]
*  Now Golden Tree is taking the power authority to court to force them to raise electricity [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=33.04s)]
*  costs and use that money for a payout to the bondholders of $8.5 billion. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=37.24s)]
*  But activists say that's the last place Puerto Ricans' money should be going. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=43.4s)]
*  The bondholders want is to have that money just for repayment instead of investing it [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  in the grid, which is what it actually needs. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=52.22s)]
*  If it's not invested in repairs, people are just going to have to leave the island. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  The other company that stands to make millions off of Puerto Rico's crisis is Luma Energy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=57.28s)]
*  Luma is the private U.S.-Canadian company that now manages the island's electrical [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=70.48s)]
*  grid. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=74.68s)]
*  Back on the island, Puerto Ricans hit the streets in outrage at Luma Energy after another [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=75.68s)]
*  massive blackout left 340,000 people without power during a heatwave last month. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  In 2021, Luma took over parts of Puerto Rico's once publicly owned grid in a 15-year deal [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=84.92s)]
*  for $1.5 billion that was sealed behind closed doors. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=94.88s)]
*  Puerto Ricans were promised a privatized grid would improve service. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=99.56s)]
*  Under Luma's watch, blackouts are only more frequent and prolonged, and electricity costs [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=114.92s)]
*  are higher than ever. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=126.56s)]
*  After several Luma price hikes, Puerto Ricans now pay an electricity rate 40% higher than [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=127.92s)]
*  what those in the U.S. pay, which means they're spending 8% of their incomes on electric bills, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=132.52s)]
*  compared to 2.4% for Americans. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=137.44s)]
*  Narv√°ez is referring to the hundreds of skilled electrical linemen with the Union of Electricity [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=140.12s)]
*  Workers who were forced out and replaced by workers from Luma's parent company. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=161.56s)]
*  But a shortage of expertise only partially explains Luma's incompetence. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=165.84s)]
*  That's the U.S.-appointed board which has controlled all of Puerto Rico's fiscal policies [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=195.84s)]
*  since 2016 when Obama signed the PROMESA Act. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=199.96s)]
*  They are totally unelected by Puerto Ricans. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=203.76s)]
*  By selling off Puerto Rico's public assets to private companies, the U.S. government [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=206.8s)]
*  is ensuring the island is more favorable for its corporate profits while making it unlivable [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=210.96s)]
*  for Puerto Ricans. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  There are now more Puerto Ricans in the diaspora than on the island itself, and they say they're [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=217.12s)]
*  being forced out by these austerity policies. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  Forced displacement is a weapon of colonialism. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=224.48s)]
*  They are making conditions in Puerto Rico impossible for people to survive, for people [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=227.48s)]
*  to make a living, for people to access food, water, their basic needs. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=231.68s)]
*  So Puerto Ricans believe that they'll find it here in the United States of America, and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=236.0s)]
*  when they come here they realize that the situation is just as dire here for Puerto [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=240.68s)]
*  Ricans and for all people that live in the United States of America. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=244.76s)]
*  They want us out of Puerto Rico so that they can take over and make it into their own paradise, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  their tax haven. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OxQ1MkQ81s&t=253.84s)]
