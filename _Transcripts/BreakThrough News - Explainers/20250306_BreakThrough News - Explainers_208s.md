Video Description: 1 in 4 New Yorkers can’t afford basic necessities.

BT’s Kei Pritsker discusses the new study that the rest of the media is ignoring.

# 1 in 4 New Yorkers Can’t Afford Basic Necessities.
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I)
*  One in four New Yorkers can't afford basic necessities like food, rent, and doctors visits. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=0.0s)]
*  A new study at Columbia University found that poverty in America's most populated city [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=6.0s)]
*  is nearly double the national average. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=10.96s)]
*  That's over 2 million New Yorkers, almost half a million of which are children, living [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  in households where four more people are trying to live off a combined $47,000 a year. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=17.96s)]
*  58% of New Yorkers, or 4.8 million people, were in families with incomes below 200% of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=24.04s)]
*  the poverty line, or $94,000 a year. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=29.8s)]
*  Now if you live in New York City, or any comparable city, you're probably wondering how could [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=32.92s)]
*  four people survive off of $47,000 a year? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=37.4s)]
*  In New York City, rent alone is an average $3,900 a month. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  The one in four number is shocking, but you also have to remember that New York City is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=46.92s)]
*  widely considered the wealthiest city in the country, if not the world. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=50.28s)]
*  As the nerve center of US capitalism, New York City residents' cumulative wealth is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=54.6s)]
*  over $3 trillion, more than the entire GDP of Italy, Canada, Brazil, or Russia. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=58.64s)]
*  New York City also has more millionaires than any city in the world, with close to $350,000. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=65.88s)]
*  In other words, there's plenty of wealth in New York. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=71.56s)]
*  It's just distributed in the most unequal way imaginable. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=74.32s)]
*  The study recommends a number of policies to alleviate the problem, like tax cuts for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=78.32s)]
*  workers and tax cuts for workers with children. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=82.36s)]
*  One thing that's not mentioned in the study that you might find interesting is that New [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=85.44s)]
*  York State has a law called the Stock Transfer Tax, which taxes five cents from every sale [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=88.88s)]
*  of stock with more than $20. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=93.96s)]
*  In 2022, $443 trillion worth of stocks was traded on the New York Stock Exchange. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=96.8s)]
*  Even taxing a small percentage of this wealth could greatly alleviate poverty in New York [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=104.16s)]
*  City and cities around the country. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=108.8s)]
*  Wall Street transaction taxes have been proposed by progressive politicians like Bernie Sanders [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=111.08s)]
*  but New York already has a stock transfer tax on the books and collects that tax every [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=115.4s)]
*  year. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=121.56s)]
*  But get this, in 1981, the state started rebating this money back to Wall Street. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=122.56s)]
*  New York State has lost a total of $400 billion over the last four decades because of these [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=128.44s)]
*  rebates. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  This new report is shocking, but what's most shocking is that you hardly hear anyone talking [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  about it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=140.56s)]
*  You don't hear about it in Congress, you don't hear about it on the news. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=141.56s)]
*  It doesn't even register as an issue. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=144.88s)]
*  Even Donald Trump, who's not only from New York, but who also made his whole political [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  marketing gimmick, America First and Make America Great Again, hasn't said a thing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=151.72s)]
*  about it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=156.84s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=157.84s)]
*  It's because our political system is run by the same people who are responsible for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=158.84s)]
*  the problem. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=163.04s)]
*  The majority of the members in the 116th Congress were millionaires. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  The current presidential administration features 13 billionaires and is collectively worth [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=167.72s)]
*  close to $500 billion. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=172.16s)]
*  It's widely understood that in American politics, politicians only answer to their [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=173.88s)]
*  donors. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=178.8s)]
*  You'd think that widespread poverty in the most populous city in America would be cause [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=179.8s)]
*  for concern for the people running our country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=184.8s)]
*  But it isn't, because they're the ones who created the problem and the ones who benefit [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=187.44s)]
*  from it remaining unsolved. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  Even our media is controlled by the ultra-rich, so these kinds of things don't even get [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=193.64s)]
*  reported in places like Fox News or MSNBC. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=197.04s)]
*  In fact, I'm sure a lot of you are only learning about this because you're watching Breakthrough [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=200.72s)]
*  News, which is why you should share this video and support our work. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7YJl2wLc_I&t=204.12s)]
