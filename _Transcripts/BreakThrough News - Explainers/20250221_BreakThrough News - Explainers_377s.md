Video Description: The Republicans are trying to make workers pay for billionaire tax cuts.
While they claim their new budget will help the working class, it's actually a massive handout to the rich.

# Republicans Are Trying To Make Workers Pay For Billionaire Tax Cuts
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck)
*  History has some great heists. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=0.0s)]
*  You may have heard of the Antwerp Diamond Heist [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=1.68s)]
*  when a crew of thieves passed 10 layers of security [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=4.48s)]
*  and stole $100 million without triggering [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  any of the 63 security cameras. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=9.76s)]
*  Or there was the group in California in 1997 [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=12.16s)]
*  that held up a depot of armored trucks [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=14.8s)]
*  and stole $19 million. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=16.52s)]
*  But nothing compares to the Great Republican Tax Heist [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=18.56s)]
*  of 2025, which is undoubtedly the greatest heist [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=21.48s)]
*  in human history. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=24.64s)]
*  And like all great heists, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=25.68s)]
*  this one is happening with simple deception, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  right in plain sight. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=30.2s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  The House Republicans just put out a budget [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  that would cut taxes by $4.5 trillion [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=34.64s)]
*  over the next 10 years, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=37.36s)]
*  and Republicans are already going to the media [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=38.92s)]
*  saying that they're helping the working class [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=40.8s)]
*  by putting money back in their pockets. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=42.72s)]
*  The budget would extend the 2017 Trump tax cuts, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=45.04s)]
*  which were tax cuts from Trump's first term, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=47.84s)]
*  that cut taxes almost exclusively for the top 1% [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=50.4s)]
*  in multinational corporations. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=54.32s)]
*  When these tax cuts went into effect in 2018, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=56.8s)]
*  the bottom 60% of income earners saved less than $500 [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=59.68s)]
*  on their tax bill, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=64.08s)]
*  but the average family in the top 1% [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=65.16s)]
*  got a tax cut of $60,000 on average. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  The average family in the top 1 10th of 1% [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=71.12s)]
*  got an average tax cut of a quarter of a million dollars. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=73.96s)]
*  The Trump tax cuts also created a 20% deduction [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=76.96s)]
*  for pass-through income, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  which is business income that goes to shareholders, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=80.72s)]
*  and it doubled the estate tax exemption, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=83.28s)]
*  allowing the ultra rich to pass $22 million [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=85.96s)]
*  onto their heirs tax-free, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=88.55999999999999s)]
*  as opposed to the 11 million that it did prior. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  But corporations got the biggest tax cut of anyone, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  with a permanent reduction in the corporate tax rate [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=95.8s)]
*  from 35% to 21%. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  In the three years after the Trump tax cuts passed, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=101.44s)]
*  the 300 largest corporations in America [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=104.0s)]
*  paid $240 billion less in taxes [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=106.83999999999999s)]
*  than they would have had the tax cuts not passed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  That's money that could have been used [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  to build infrastructure, hospitals, schools, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=114.24s)]
*  or just lower our taxes by $240 billion. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=117.36s)]
*  But instead, Congressional Republicans [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=121.08s)]
*  are trying to sell us on this idea [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  that the rich actually didn't get enough tax cuts [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  in Trump's first term, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  and that we should cut their taxes even further. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=127.6s)]
*  Elon Musk tried to justify all these things [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=130.12s)]
*  in a press conference the other day, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=132.2s)]
*  saying the Trump administration can do all this [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=133.92s)]
*  because they won the election, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=136.32s)]
*  and that gives them a mandate [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=137.92s)]
*  to carry out the will of the voters. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=139.32s)]
*  But I'm pretty sure when those of you [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=141.4s)]
*  who voted for Trump heard him talk about tax cuts [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=142.88s)]
*  on the campaign trail, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=145.48s)]
*  you were hoping he would cut your taxes, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=146.96s)]
*  not the taxes of C-suite executives [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=149.28s)]
*  running multinational corporations. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=151.32s)]
*  But the kicker is how they plan on paying for these tax cuts, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=153.76s)]
*  because if the government is taking in less money in taxes, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=157.12s)]
*  they have to cut spending. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=159.88s)]
*  So where do they wanna cut spending? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=161.96s)]
*  Take a guess. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=164.6s)]
*  Take a wild guess what programs the billionaire-run, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=165.84s)]
*  Silicon Valley, hedge fund oligarch administration [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=169.68s)]
*  wants to cut. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=173.36s)]
*  Medicaid, SNAP, and public education. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=174.8s)]
*  In other words, they want students and poor people [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=177.8s)]
*  to pay for the tax cuts for billionaires [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  and the corporatocracy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=183.52s)]
*  That apparently is what America First is all about. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=185.0s)]
*  By the way, they're aiming to cut anywhere [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=188.68s)]
*  from $1.5 to $2 trillion in spending, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  which is funny because that would still add up [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=194.28s)]
*  to $3 trillion to the national debt. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  This should make it absolutely clear [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=199.44s)]
*  that all of this rhetoric [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=201.44s)]
*  coming from the Trump administration [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=203.04s)]
*  about cutting the deficit and balancing the budget [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=204.44s)]
*  is just an excuse to cut social programs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=207.48s)]
*  They don't care about balancing the budget. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=210.56s)]
*  And Republicans are already doing damage control [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  on that front, saying that the tax cuts [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=215.28s)]
*  aren't really creating a $4 trillion hole in the budget [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=217.04s)]
*  because the wealth is eventually gonna trickle down, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=220.0s)]
*  meaning once we give the billionaires their tax cuts, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=222.68s)]
*  we're supposed to believe that the money [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=225.2s)]
*  is somehow gonna magically come back to us, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=226.48s)]
*  like they're gonna share their wealth with us, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=229.64s)]
*  like we all know billionaires are notorious for doing. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=231.16s)]
*  For all the trickle-down people out there, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=235.72s)]
*  I want you to look at this graph. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=238.16s)]
*  It's a graph that shows the relationship [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=240.16s)]
*  between tax rates on the rich and their share of the income. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  When the tax rate on the wealthy goes down, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=245.22s)]
*  income inequality goes up. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=247.56s)]
*  In other words, no, the rich aren't going [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=249.6s)]
*  to share their wealth with us, they're just gonna keep it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  Shocking, I know. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=254.68s)]
*  In the last few years, Trump and the Republican Party [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=256.2s)]
*  have been rebranding themselves as the party [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=259.2s)]
*  of the working class, and they've done it [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=260.8s)]
*  fairly successfully in some areas. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=263.08s)]
*  They've actually convinced people that lowering taxes [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=265.2s)]
*  on billionaires and cutting corporate regulations [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=267.47999999999996s)]
*  is somehow gonna help the working class [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=270.08s)]
*  and not the billionaires. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=271.9s)]
*  But the fact that they ran their whole campaign [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=273.47999999999996s)]
*  on this idea that they were gonna put the people [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=275.64s)]
*  back in power, only to put a bunch of tech lords [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=277.82s)]
*  and Wall Street robber barons in place [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  as soon as they got an office, should make it clear [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=282.52s)]
*  beyond a shadow of a doubt that America first [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=285.36s)]
*  and Make America Great Again are fraudulent hollow slogans [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=288.68s)]
*  designed to hypnotize the American working class [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=292.36s)]
*  that's hanging on by a thread. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=294.92s)]
*  And this is not to say that the Democrats [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=296.76s)]
*  are fighting Wall Street either. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=298.8s)]
*  If you look at how the ultra-rich fared under either party, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=300.4s)]
*  you'd see that there's really no difference. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump gave the ultra-rich a massive $2 trillion [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=305.52s)]
*  tax cut during his first term, but under four years [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  of Joe Biden's presidency, the top 1 10th of 1% [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  increased their wealth by $6 trillion. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=314.4s)]
*  And now Trump wants to take that and fire it [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=317.6s)]
*  into outer orbit with these tax cuts, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=319.76s)]
*  which is probably why Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=321.92s)]
*  once said that it doesn't matter [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=325.68s)]
*  who wins the presidential election. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=327.12s)]
*  Whether you voted for Trump or Kamala Harris, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=329.08s)]
*  the billionaires are screwing us all the same. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=331.54s)]
*  And more and more it feels like this perpetual, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=334.0s)]
*  arbitrary 50-50 division between Democrat and Republican [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=336.64s)]
*  is actually an essential part of keeping [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=341.18s)]
*  the working class divided while the corporateocracy [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=342.92s)]
*  takes over our government. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=345.72s)]
*  The truth is, we actually have way more in common [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=348.34s)]
*  than we have differences, specifically this common enemy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=350.38s)]
*  And with every passing day, the two sides [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=353.86s)]
*  get clearer and clearer. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=356.78s)]
*  It's corporate America versus the working class. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=358.7s)]
*  And it doesn't take a genius to figure out [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=361.5s)]
*  that this status quo isn't sustainable. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=363.52s)]
*  The question for us is, what do we do next? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=366.5s)]
*  Should we be in charge of our own destiny, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=369.28s)]
*  or will we continue to allow the billionaires [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=371.92s)]
*  to rule over us forever? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddVocJdX1Ck&t=374.65999999999997s)]
