# He Was The Most Decorated Marine In US History. Then He Turned on The Empire.
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY)
*  Do you know who Smedley Butler was? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=0.0s)]
*  If not, you definitely should. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=2.4s)]
*  Smedley Butler was a two-star general in the Marine Corps. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=4.4s)]
*  He's one of only two Marines in history to earn the Medal of Honor twice, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=6.8s)]
*  and at the time of his death, he was the most decorated Marine in U.S. history. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=10.0s)]
*  He was also a socialist and an avowed anti-imperialist. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=14.4s)]
*  Smedley Butler joined the military during the Spanish-American War, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=18.0s)]
*  which is considered the U.S.'s first war of foreign expansion and the birth of its global empire. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=21.2s)]
*  At the time, the Spanish Empire controlled Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=26.2s)]
*  but the Spanish Empire was also weakening. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=31.0s)]
*  The United States, on the other hand, was a growing power [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=33.0s)]
*  and saw this as an opportunity to dethrone the Spanish Empire and become a global power itself. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=35.8s)]
*  No different than the wars today, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=41.0s)]
*  the United States disguised its imperialist motives by saying that they were fighting the war for humanitarian reasons, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=42.8s)]
*  to save the poor Cuban people from the brutal Spanish Empire. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=49.0s)]
*  The media also played the exact same role that it does today as a cheerleader for the war, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=52.6s)]
*  writing sensational war propaganda about the brutality of the Spanish [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=57.0s)]
*  and how the U.S. had to intervene to save the Cubans, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=61.0s)]
*  a practice that got its own nickname, yellow journalism. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=64.0s)]
*  Like so many young men who were eager to do good in the world, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=66.8s)]
*  Butler got caught up in this war propaganda and enlisted in the Marine Corps at the age of 16, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=70.0s)]
*  lying about his age to get in. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=75.2s)]
*  He wrote later, recounting his feelings when he decided to enlist, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=77.0s)]
*  I clenched my fist when I thought of those poor Cuban devils being starved and murdered by the beastly Spanish tyrants. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=80.4s)]
*  Butler was deployed to Cuba in July of 1898, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  and for the next 20 years Butler was sent on one imperialist expedition after another, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=89.4s)]
*  clearing the way for U.S. corporations with a hail of bullets. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=94.0s)]
*  After Cuba, Butler was deployed to the Philippines, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=97.0s)]
*  Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua, Panama, Mexico, and even as far as China. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  Butler was regarded as a highly disciplined Marine and rose quickly through the ranks as an officer, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=105.8s)]
*  but over time he started to realize more and more that he and his fellow Marines were being used to do grunt work for big business, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  not to spread freedom and democracy like they thought they would when they enlisted. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  While he was in Nicaragua, where the U.S. military would back a right-wing, pro-business government friendly to U.S. corporations, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  Butler wrote in a letter home, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=128.2s)]
*  What makes me mad is that this whole revolution is inspired and financed by Americans who have wildcat investments down here, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=130.2s)]
*  and want to make them good by putting in a government which will declare a monopoly in their favor. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=137.0s)]
*  By the time Butler retired in 1931, he had won more ribbons and medals than any Marine in U.S. history up until that point, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=141.8s)]
*  but after all of that, his sole conclusion was that all of the wars he fought were just big money-making schemes for corporate America. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=148.8s)]
*  In an article he wrote for the socialist magazine Common Sense, he said, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=156.4s)]
*  I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=187.4s)]
*  I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1902 to 1912. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=191.4s)]
*  I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=197.4s)]
*  I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=201.4s)]
*  In China in 1927, I helped to see that standard oil went on its way unmolested. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=205.4s)]
*  Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=211.4s)]
*  The best he could do was operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=214.4s)]
*  He summarized his thoughts on war in a book called War is a Racket, in which he explains that all war is simply a racket, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=219.4s)]
*  a money-making scheme for a small group of elites. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=226.4s)]
*  Here's how the book opens. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=229.4s)]
*  In World War I, a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=245.4s)]
*  At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the World War. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=249.4s)]
*  That many admitted their huge blood gains in their income tax returns. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=254.4s)]
*  How many other war millionaires falsified their income tax returns, no one knows. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=258.4s)]
*  How many of these millionaires shouldered a rifle? How many of them dug a trench? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=262.4s)]
*  How many of them spent sleepless, frightened nights ducking shells and shrapnel and machine gun bullets? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=266.4s)]
*  How many of them were wounded or killed in battle? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=272.4s)]
*  Butler was hugely popular with veterans, not only because of his rank and reputation, but because he advocated for them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=275.4s)]
*  In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, Butler helped lead the Bonus March, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=281.4s)]
*  a massive march of World War I veterans and their families who marched on Congress to demand bonus pay [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=286.4s)]
*  that they had been promised for fighting in World War I but never received. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=291.4s)]
*  Butler gave speeches telling the veterans that they had as much of a right to lobby Congress as anyone else. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=295.4s)]
*  But instead of paying the soldiers, the margin camp was broken up with cavalry charges and tear gas. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=300.4s)]
*  The Bonus March demonstrated the power that veterans could wield when organized. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=306.4s)]
*  Big business interests took notice of this power and Butler's influence with veterans, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=309.4s)]
*  and in 1934, Butler claims he was approached by a businessman named Gerald P. McGuire, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=314.4s)]
*  who said that a group of businessmen, backed by 500,000 soldiers and $3 million from J.P. Morgan Bank, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=319.4s)]
*  were planning to overthrow President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and said that they wanted Butler to lead the plot [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=326.4s)]
*  and become America's fascist dictator. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=332.4s)]
*  Butler refused and instead testified to Congress about the plot. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=334.4s)]
*  After hearing Butler's testimony, the committee said, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=338.4s)]
*  Butler would spend the rest of his life speaking out against war profiteering until his death in 1940. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=356.4s)]
*  Even though he was one of the most decorated and widely respected Marines in U.S. history, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=362.4s)]
*  I'm willing to bet that most of the people you know, and probably a lot of you watching this, have never even heard of him. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=366.4s)]
*  And it's obvious why. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=372.4s)]
*  All of the soldiers that are elevated as war heroes in our culture all have one thing in common. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=374.4s)]
*  They obediently follow their orders and carry them out without question. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=379.4s)]
*  They never question the motives of the war, they never speak out, and therefore they never threaten the politicians and the war profiteers. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=383.4s)]
*  It's like the war profiteers put a model of the exact kind of soldier they want in all of our movies and TV shows. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=390.4s)]
*  And that's why you never hear about soldiers like Smedly Butler and why they try to smear Aaron Bushnell. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=396.4s)]
*  There's a long history of soldiers engaging in mutiny and revolt that they hide from us because a lot of times, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=401.4s)]
*  these revolts become a catalyst for revolution. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=407.4s)]
*  The fundamental lie that all wars are built on is this idea that some guy far away, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=409.4s)]
*  someone you've never met halfway across the world, is somehow your enemy [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=414.4s)]
*  and not the millionaire politicians and their billionaire owners sending you to die. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=419.4s)]
*  Our enemy isn't in some far off land speaking foreign languages and hiding in caves. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=423.4s)]
*  Our enemy is right here. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=428.4s)]
*  It's all these politicians who foam at the mouth to send our children to war and all the CEOs who make money off them dying. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=430.4s)]
*  War has always been a racket. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=436.4s)]
*  The ruling class knows this better than anyone because they're the ones that benefit. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=438.4s)]
*  And they fear the military waking up to this because the day that happens is the day the guns turn around. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om4yGNFZjYY&t=442.4s)]
