# Hereâ€™s Why Police Departments Look Like Standing Armies
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8)
*  So it's not even it's not even five minutes after I just did that intro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=0.0s)]
*  They're firing flashbangs over there. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=12.6s)]
*  So again, the curfew hasn't even hit yet, but the police are starting to shoot rubber [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=15.4s)]
*  bullets and flashbangs. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=20.8s)]
*  People are already sort of scattering. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=22.28s)]
*  I think let's go try to check it out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=24.12s)]
*  So you can see people are holding their hands up and they're literally chanting peaceful [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  protest. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=37.82s)]
*  I haven't seen any violence out here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=38.32s)]
*  It's all coming from the police. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  There's what looks like an armored car back there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Now we have mounted police gathering and again, it is it is 635. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=47.72s)]
*  The curfew has not hit yet. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=52.72s)]
*  This is a completely lawful demonstration. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=54.22s)]
*  The police have been indiscriminate in their violence against protesters. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=82.72s)]
*  Their main tactic has been firing so-called rubber bullets at people, projectiles that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=101.22s)]
*  have a slightly foamy tip but travel at hundreds of miles an hour and being fired at people [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=105.22s)]
*  at point blank range. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=109.92s)]
*  These projectiles have been widely referred to as non-lethals, but they've killed people [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=111.42s)]
*  in the past. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=115.72s)]
*  Numerous videos have shown police firing these rubber bullets at protesters, bystanders and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=116.72s)]
*  journalists alike, which I can personally attest to. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=121.12s)]
*  Here they shot a rubber bullet at me and it just barely missed my head hitting a metal [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=123.92s)]
*  bar above me. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=127.92s)]
*  The brutal repression we've seen over the last week is part of a deliberate plan from [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  the Trump administration to impose a form of military rule in America's streets. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=138.72s)]
*  The Trump administration is arguing that it has the right to deploy the military anywhere [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=142.72s)]
*  in the country to quell protests, while California Governor Gavin Newsom, joined by Democratic [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=146.22s)]
*  governors around the country, insists that the president needs permission from governors [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=150.52s)]
*  before deploying the military to their state and that local law enforcement is able to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=154.52s)]
*  handle, i.e. repress, the protests by themselves. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=158.62s)]
*  Karen Bass and Gavin Newsom's pledge to repress the protests is an attempt to prove that they [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=162.22s)]
*  don't need the National Guard to control the protests, that local and state law enforcement [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=166.62s)]
*  agencies are capable of brutalizing protesters into submission on their own without help [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=171.12s)]
*  from Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=175.62s)]
*  This is why the vast majority of violence against protesters in Los Angeles is actually [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=176.62s)]
*  coming from state and local law enforcement agencies under the control of California's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  Democrats like Karen Bass and Gavin Newsom. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=184.22s)]
*  This begs the question, what part of this is standing up to Trump? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  If Democrats really wanted to oppose Trump, shouldn't they start by protecting the immigrant [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  communities that Trump is targeting? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=194.92s)]
*  How does brutalizing the people protesting Trump's policies help stop Donald Trump? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=197.02s)]
*  While it's clear that Donald Trump is trying to provoke chaos by deploying the National [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=201.52s)]
*  Guard, the Democrats have actually accelerated that dynamic by unleashing state and local [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=205.32s)]
*  law enforcement on the protesters. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=209.82s)]
*  For decades, U.S. geopolitical and economic power rested firmly on America's role as [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=212.12s)]
*  the world's leading military superpower. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=216.72s)]
*  Under the guise of fighting communism or terrorism, the U.S. military marched around the world [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=219.48s)]
*  toppling governments and replacing them with pro-American puppets who would sell off their [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=224.36s)]
*  country's labor and resources to American corporations and business tycoons. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=228.66000000000003s)]
*  America's ability to wage these imperial wars was largely made possible by its arms [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=232.66000000000003s)]
*  manufacturing industry, which is the largest in the world by far. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=237.46s)]
*  But the U.S.'s waning dominance following its disastrous attempts at occupying Iraq [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=240.96s)]
*  and Afghanistan seriously undermined the U.S.'s ability to wage ground invasions in foreign [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=245.52s)]
*  And with inequality and social unrest increasing in the wake of the financial crisis and the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=251.36s)]
*  election of Donald Trump, the surplus of weapons that America had flooded the world with found [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=255.46s)]
*  a new purpose, suppressing protests on American streets. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=259.86s)]
*  In addition to the astronomical rise of local police budgets, law enforcement agencies also [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=263.66s)]
*  increasingly absorbed the surplus weaponry no longer being used by the military for free [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=268.56s)]
*  through a program called the 1033 program. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  The 1033 program started during the height of the war on drugs, but you really start [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=275.56s)]
*  to see the use of this program skyrocket at the beginning of the 2010s when the U.S. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=279.56s)]
*  began winding down its military presence in Iraq. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=283.76s)]
*  All of that equipment, which was designed to fight wars, was all of a sudden transferred [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=286.86s)]
*  to local police departments to police Americans. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=291.46s)]
*  And we're not just talking about assault rifles and bulletproof vests. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=294.86s)]
*  We're talking armored vehicles, tanks, helicopters, grenade launchers, all given to your local [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=297.96s)]
*  police department for zero cost. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=303.46s)]
*  One of the most controversial transfers was the Mine Resistant Ambush Protective Vehicle, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=305.56s)]
*  or MRAP, which was originally designed to protect soldiers in Iraq from IEDs. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=310.46s)]
*  Hundreds of MRAPs and similar armored vehicles were transferred to police in the United States [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=315.26s)]
*  throughout the 2010s and have been deployed to protest in the United States. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=319.56s)]
*  When the military recruits people, it tells them they're going to fight a foreign enemy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=323.56s)]
*  So when you arm and dress police officers like soldiers, not only does the public begin [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=328.06s)]
*  to understand them more as an occupying army being deployed against them, it's now the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=332.56s)]
*  logic of the police training itself, that the American public asserting its constitutional [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=337.26s)]
*  rights is actually an enemy force. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=341.86s)]
*  Donald Trump obviously has a personal agenda to establish a new form of right-wing dictatorship, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=344.16s)]
*  staging military protests on his birthday and promising to crush all dissent with the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=349.26s)]
*  military. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=353.56s)]
*  But he's also a manifestation of what the system and both major parties have produced. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=354.56s)]
*  It's Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass's cops brutalizing protesters here in LA. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=359.56s)]
*  It was Joe Biden celebrating the cops sent in to beat up college students for protesting [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=364.56s)]
*  the genocide in Palestine. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=368.86s)]
*  It was the Obama government that federally coordinated the crackdown of militarized police [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=370.36s)]
*  forces in Ferguson, Missouri, Standing Rock, and Occupy Wall Street. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=373.86s)]
*  The conservatives cheering on the crackdown against the anti-ICE protests have for years [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=378.26s)]
*  presented themselves as defenders of free speech and against federal overreach. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=382.06s)]
*  But now what they're normalizing with these kinds of militarized responses is that when [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=386.76000000000005s)]
*  anyone protests or when anyone criticizes the government, it's fine to meet them with [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=391.16s)]
*  this kind of brutal force. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=395.96000000000004s)]
*  So this affects all of us. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=397.86s)]
*  Donald Trump has already announced that he'd be tapping Palantir to build a database on [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=399.66s)]
*  every single American. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=403.46000000000004s)]
*  He's going after the most vulnerable people now. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=405.06s)]
*  But there's nothing stopping him from making you his next enemy. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6lgpNaCUl8&t=407.16s)]
