# The Truth About U.S. Sanctions Against Zimbabwe
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [December 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M)
*  The United States recently issued new sanctions against Zimbabwe, and I think most people's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=0.0s)]
*  reaction is going to be, why the hell are we going after Zimbabwe? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=4.72s)]
*  When you think about the countries the US is punishing with financial and trade sanctions, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=8.08s)]
*  most people know of Iran or Cuba or Venezuela. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=12.84s)]
*  But the United States has actually maintained a severe sanctions regime against Zimbabwe [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  for the last 21 years, and it hardly gets mentioned in the media. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=20.38s)]
*  And the worst part is, these sanctions were essentially put in place because Zimbabweans [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=24.12s)]
*  took back their own land from European settlers. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=28.12s)]
*  Here's what you need to know. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  Zimbabwe, like many other regions of Africa, was colonized by European powers in the late [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=32.6s)]
*  19th century. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=36.88s)]
*  The various European powers met at the Berlin Conference in 1884 and divided up the continent, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=38.0s)]
*  deciding which powers would control which regions. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  The British Empire, one of the strongest European powers at the time, decided that it would [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=45.84s)]
*  take massive portions of northern and southern Africa, including Zimbabwe. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=49.68s)]
*  The man responsible for overseeing Britain's conquest of southern Africa was Cecil Rhodes, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=53.88s)]
*  an arch-racist and an unabashed defender of European imperialism and colonization. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  To give you an idea of how we thought, here's Rhodes in his own words, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  And by the way, this is the same Rhodes that the Rhodes Scholarship is named after. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=84.24s)]
*  In 1890, Rhodes led the British conquest of Zimbabwe and named it Rhodesia, after himself. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=88.52s)]
*  A little over a decade later, the British controlled three-quarters of their country [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=94.24s)]
*  and made the indigenous Africans tenants on their own land, forcing them to pay fees and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=98.32s)]
*  taxes to live on the land that rightfully belonged to them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=103.24s)]
*  Taking the land and all the valuable resources that came with it made the British settlers [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=106.28s)]
*  incredibly wealthy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  On the flip side, having their land taken, black Rhodesians were forced to become wage [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=111.52s)]
*  laborers, working for the white landowners for barely enough to scrape by. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=116.8s)]
*  The typical white neighborhood in Rhodesia had big luxury houses with big lawns and gardens, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  while most black people lived in cramped substandard housing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=126.24s)]
*  The only black people that lived in the nicer white neighborhoods were domestic workers, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=129.56s)]
*  who took care of household labor and landscaping. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=133.32s)]
*  They lived on their white employers' properties. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=135.96s)]
*  The white monopoly over the land also gave whites a monopoly over the Rhodesian political [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=138.18s)]
*  system, which was dominated by whites despite the fact that the country was overwhelmingly [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=142.18s)]
*  black. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=146.70000000000002s)]
*  To give you an idea of how skewed Rhodesia's political system was, in 1976, Rhodesia's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  black population was over 6 million, while the white population was only 250,000. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=152.46s)]
*  Despite this, of the 6 million black people in Rhodesia, only 9,000 had the right to vote. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=157.9s)]
*  This allowed white voters to elect 50 members of Rhodesia's parliament, whereas black voters [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=163.5s)]
*  only elected 16. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=167.62s)]
*  Many in the United States understandably compared this to Jim Crow. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=169.84s)]
*  Rhodesia's Prime Minister, Ian Smith, famously declared that he would never support black [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=172.9s)]
*  majority rule in the country, not in a thousand years. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=177.3s)]
*  The government was so committed to white minority rule that it would go on to draft every white [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=180.8s)]
*  man under the age of 38 into the military to fight a bloody war against black liberation [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=184.8s)]
*  fighters instead of making concessions to them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=189.84s)]
*  However, no amount of conscription can change the reality that this country did not, nor [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=192.26s)]
*  would it ever belong to white people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=196.52s)]
*  They had merely occupied it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  Recognizing that a white-led government in southern Africa would never last, in 1979, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=199.96s)]
*  the Rhodesian government pressured the black freedom fighters into an agreement called [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=204.88s)]
*  the Lancaster House Agreement in an attempt to salvage some semblance of white power. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=208.08s)]
*  The Lancaster House Agreement reserved parliamentary seats for whites, and instead of simply returning [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=212.66000000000003s)]
*  the stolen land back to its rightful owners, set up a market-based system called Willing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=217.06s)]
*  Buyer-Willing Seller, where the government of the newly named Zimbabwe would have to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  buy their own land back from the white farmers using foreign currency. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=225.84s)]
*  The value of the land would be determined by foreign real estate companies owned by [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=229.88s)]
*  these very same white farmers. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=233.22s)]
*  Zimbabwe's newly elected president, Robert Mugabe, who had become a preeminent leader [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=235.2s)]
*  in the liberation struggle, tried to adhere to the Lancaster Agreement, but progress was [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=239.56s)]
*  slow. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=244.2s)]
*  For most of this time, western powers praised Mugabe as a kind of moderate, reasonable force. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=245.2s)]
*  But even a decade after the end of the war, in the fall of Rhodesia, whites still controlled [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=250.6s)]
*  the vast majority of the land. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=254.88s)]
*  In 1998, it was estimated that 95% of the economy was owned by white people or foreign [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=256.88s)]
*  investors. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=262.2s)]
*  Many veterans of the liberation war were getting tired of waiting. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=263.38s)]
*  After all, they had risked their lives for this land, and they were beginning to feel [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=266.9s)]
*  that all of that fighting had been for nothing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=269.88s)]
*  The war veterans started occupying the white farms on their own accord, and Mugabe then [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=272.64s)]
*  gave the veterans the government's backing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=276.68s)]
*  In direct response to this policy, the U.S. Congress passed its first set of sanctions [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=278.88s)]
*  against Zimbabwe, freezing Zimbabwe's credit. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=283.28s)]
*  For the next 21 years, the U.S., EU, and Canada would go on to repeatedly punish Zimbabwe [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=286.11999999999995s)]
*  for what amounts to taking back its own land. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=292.28s)]
*  The latest round of sanctions is just a continuation of this neocolonial history. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  After a two-week trip in Zimbabwe, the U.N.'s Special Rapporteur on Sanctions wrote a report [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=299.23999999999995s)]
*  calling on the various countries sanctioning Zimbabwe to lift these measures because of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=303.84s)]
*  the devastating effect they had on the country. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=308.2s)]
*  The report describes a country unable to develop because the financial sanctions against [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=310.58s)]
*  it prevented from accessing credit and trading on the international market. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=314.58s)]
*  The report states that financial restrictions prevent Zimbabwe from importing new technology [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=318.38s)]
*  and spare parts, which has rendered much of its health, transportation, energy, water, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=322.62s)]
*  and other critical infrastructure obsolete. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=327.78s)]
*  These policies have created a crisis of food insecurity, with over 7 million Zimbabweans [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=330.44s)]
*  going hungry in a country of 15 million, as well as a crisis of disease due to Zimbabwe's [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=335.16s)]
*  inability to import parts needed to clean its own water. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  The sanctions against Zimbabwe's state-owned companies have deprived Zimbabwe of revenue [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=343.92s)]
*  that it needs to fund essential services. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=347.86s)]
*  In total, it's estimated that sanctions have deprived Zimbabwe of over $100 billion [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=350.18s)]
*  worth of aid and loans since 2001, a sum four times greater than the country's GDP. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=355.04s)]
*  The Western media still demonizes Zimbabwe as a country that's apparently racist against [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=360.9s)]
*  whites for having expropriated the land they stole. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=365.47999999999996s)]
*  They mock Zimbabwe and the land reform, saying that it's what made Zimbabwe poor, completely [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=368.32s)]
*  leaving out any mention of the crushing sanctions designed to strangle Zimbabwe's economy. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=373.14s)]
*  Western governments love to talk about respecting property rights. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=378.28s)]
*  But what about when a whole ownership structure is premised on racism, theft, and colonialism? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=382.44s)]
*  It's obvious that the real right is African people's right to reclaim ownership over [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=387.18s)]
*  what was always theirs. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=391.66s)]
*  So let's be clear. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=393.58s)]
*  This is not about human rights or corruption. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=395.04s)]
*  Never has been. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=397.78s)]
*  Whether it's the Berlin Conference, sanctions against Zimbabwe, the war on Libya, or AFRICOM's [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=398.94s)]
*  expansion, it's always been about punishing any African country that defies Western powers. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYX1wPKM6M&t=404.18s)]
