# Democrats In Congress are About to Give Trump Dictatorial Powers to Crush His Opposition
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok)
*  Why are the Democrats handing Trump dictatorial powers to destroy and bankrupt his political opposition? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=0.0s)]
*  Tomorrow, congressional Democrats will join Republicans to vote on a bill that will allow the Treasury Department to strip any [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=6.48s)]
*  nonprofit that they accuse of supporting terrorism of their tax-exempt status, and they can do this without any evidence. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=13.02s)]
*  Losing their 501c3 status would prevent nonprofits from collecting tax-deductible [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=19.56s)]
*  donations and lead banks to consider freezing or closing their accounts while they'd be hit with huge tax bills. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=24.24s)]
*  Basically, it would be a strategy to completely shut down their operations. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=30.64s)]
*  Not to mention, the Treasury doesn't even need to articulate a reason or provide any evidence that the group is actually supporting terrorism. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=34.08s)]
*  They could presumably just do it based on things they've said. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Just think about the implications of this. In a world where anyone who criticizes Israel's genocide is called a supporter of terrorism, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=44.36s)]
*  that slander would now be turned into an actual weapon to target and shut down pro-Palestinian groups. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=51.04s)]
*  It could easily be used to persecute any group that's critical of the US government, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=56.76s)]
*  especially its foreign policy, given how loosely the word terrorism is used in this country. This bill, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=60.68s)]
*  which 52 Democrats voted for alongside all but one Republican, would give these powers to the incoming Trump administration on day one. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=66.2s)]
*  So far, over 150 civil society groups have expressed their opposition to this bill in an open letter to Congress. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=74.12s)]
*  Congress initially tried to fast-track this bill and almost got the two-thirds majority required for fast-track bills with the help of several right-leaning and pro-Israel Democrats. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=80.88000000000001s)]
*  Tomorrow, they're set to vote on it again, but this time only with a simple majority, meaning it's very likely to pass. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  It's already incredibly illegal to support terrorist organizations. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=96.4s)]
*  You can go to jail for this and there's a legal standard to prove you're actually supporting terrorism materially. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=100.28s)]
*  Not to mention, any nonprofit can lose its status if it does anything illegal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  So all this begs the question, why does the executive branch even need such sweeping powers in the first place? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=110.4s)]
*  But what's really mind-boggling about all this is not even two weeks ago, the Democrats were comparing Trump to Hitler. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=116.24s)]
*  Now, they're giving the man they called Hitler the power to crush his political opposition under the guise of opposing terrorism. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump has repeatedly stated his intention to get revenge on his political enemies if he's re-elected. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=130.32s)]
*  He's also pledged to have pro-Palestine activists, which he's repeatedly tried to associate with terrorism, deported. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=135.92s)]
*  Other groups at risk could include pro-immigrant groups. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=141.88s)]
*  During his first administration, Trump was considering designating Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=144.56s)]
*  But as we've seen repeatedly, Trump and many of the other right-wing members of his new cabinet have repeatedly claimed that undocumented immigrants coming to America are agents of drug cartels. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=150.0s)]
*  This association could be used to target nonprofits that help undocumented immigrants. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=160.8s)]
*  But even groups that aren't directly involved in organizing protests or helping immigrants could be attacked under this bill just for speaking out in defense of those that do. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  This could include journalists, human rights organizations, and legal aid groups. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=173.44s)]
*  In fact, there's no telling who could be affected by this because of how ambiguous and sweeping the language of the bill is. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=177.64s)]
*  If there's any lesson to be learned here, it's that the Democrats were never going to save us. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=184.32s)]
*  All of that talk about how dangerous Trump is, and now, not even two weeks after he gets elected, a group of Democrats end up being the ones trying to hand him the weapons to crush dissent and free speech. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT1aLtj83Ok&t=189.0s)]
