# Republican Governors Claims to “Defend The Border” are Based on Lies
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [February 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I)
*  Eagle Pass, Texas, a border town on the US-Mexico border, has become the site of a massive standoff [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=0.0s)]
*  between federal border patrol agents and the Texas National Guard. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=5.84s)]
*  The whole conflict started over razor wire when Texas authorities put razor wire on the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=9.8s)]
*  southern border during a surge of migration. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=13.8s)]
*  A federal appeals court granted Texas authorities the right to do this, but a little over a [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  week ago the Supreme Court struck down this ruling and said that border patrol agents [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=20.16s)]
*  have a right to remove and cut the razor wire. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Now, as the highest court in the US, the debate should have ended there in theory, but Texas [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=26.84s)]
*  Governor Greg Abbott offered his own constitutional interpretation, saying that the surge of migration [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=31.16s)]
*  constituted an invasion and that he had the right to mobilize the Texas National Guard [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  to take over the border in lieu of what he described as the executive branch abdicating [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=39.88s)]
*  its duty to enforce immigration law. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=44.32s)]
*  Since Governor Abbott declared his intention to hold the line, every single Republican [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=46.56s)]
*  governor except one declared their support for Governor Abbott, and 10 states have dispatched [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=50.24s)]
*  detachments of their own state national guards to Texas. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=54.36s)]
*  Conservative activists have organized caravans from around the country to, in their words, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=57.56s)]
*  defend the border, and what you're seeing behind me is a culmination of that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=61.4s)]
*  What's happening here has been described as a migrant crisis or a constitutional crisis, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  but to just see images of people crossing the border obscures the deeper crisis at hand, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=69.8s)]
*  the crisis of US imperialism. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=74.4s)]
*  In the last few years, the number of migrants trying to cross the southern border has increased [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=76.64s)]
*  dramatically. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=80.68s)]
*  Countries with migrants at the border have more than tripled since the end of the Trump [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=81.68s)]
*  administration and Republicans were quick to use this to attack Biden. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=84.76s)]
*  Republicans have painted a picture of a completely poor southern border under Biden, one where [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=88.76s)]
*  border regulations aren't enforced and border agents' hands are tied, preventing them from [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=92.68s)]
*  doing their jobs. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=96.84s)]
*  This campaign has been so effective that immigration has become the most important issue for voters [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  in the upcoming election in many polls, even topping the list in states like New Hampshire, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=102.12s)]
*  which literally border Canada. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=106.84s)]
*  The right wing says that illegal immigration leads to higher crime and costs taxpayers [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=108.6s)]
*  billions of dollars in the public services used by undocumented people, talking points [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  which have been widely adopted by the conservative movement. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  Bunch of them that they shipped up here, they were criminals that were let out of jail because [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  they didn't want to take care of it anymore and they're coming into our country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=124.52s)]
*  I never know if they can seek out hate, crime, wrong, you know, because I know the state [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=127.16s)]
*  of Texas has a lot of military bases here too. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=133.6s)]
*  A report put out by the Heritage Foundation, one of the leading conservative think tanks [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=136.32s)]
*  in the US, claims definitively that higher illegal immigration leads to higher crime. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=140.04s)]
*  They cite data from the Department of Justice that shows that nearly two-thirds of federal [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=144.64s)]
*  arrests are of undocumented people. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=148.32s)]
*  Sounds pretty bad, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=150.28s)]
*  But the increase in crime they're talking about is immigration itself. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=151.72s)]
*  The first page of the DOJ report clearly states that 95% of the increase in undocumented crime [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=155.08s)]
*  is related to immigration. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=161.52s)]
*  The levels of other crimes stayed steady over the last 20 years despite the huge increase [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=163.36s)]
*  in immigration. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=167.28s)]
*  The undocumented crime wave that the right wing keeps bringing up actually just reflects [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=168.36s)]
*  the US's increased criminalization of immigration over the last two decades. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  If the US were to stop criminalizing immigration, the undocumented crime rate would disappear. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  The Heritage Foundation doesn't mention this at all, and instead lists out cherry-picked [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  anecdotes of undocumented immigrants who committed the most gruesome crimes imaginable. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=185.44000000000003s)]
*  The truth is that most undocumented immigrants essentially live under a constant police state. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=190.24s)]
*  For undocumented people, any small run-in with the law can lead to their deportation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  Even something like getting pulled over for speeding could lead to a police officer checking [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=199.10000000000002s)]
*  for ID and then finding out that that person doesn't have legal status leading to their [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=203.0s)]
*  deportation. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=207.0s)]
*  This also means undocumented people essentially don't have many legal rights, since their [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=208.0s)]
*  citizenship status can always be held over them by employers or anyone simply looking [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  to exploit a vulnerable person. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=216.32000000000002s)]
*  Immigrations frequently exploit people's undocumented status to pay them less than [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=218.28s)]
*  the minimum wage. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=222.4s)]
*  And despite being subject to these illegal labor practices, undocumented people pay tens [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=223.72s)]
*  of billions of dollars in taxes every year, literally the opposite of the above-the-law [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=228.36s)]
*  criminal trope that the right wing is pushing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=233.32s)]
*  The most common talking point we heard at the rally was that undocumented immigrants [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  are an economic burden on taxpayers because they receive government aid. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=239.52s)]
*  The threat is that we're paying for everything. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=243.16s)]
*  If they bring enough people across and overwhelm the system, you're going to be worried about [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=247.28s)]
*  it too because you won't have a job. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=251.92s)]
*  No matter whether or not you have any of these people in your backyards or in your city, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=253.6s)]
*  one of the things it does affect is your wallet. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=258.52s)]
*  It affects how the nation spends its money. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=260.52s)]
*  It affects the economy because now you're looking at debt for our great-grandchildren. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=264.52s)]
*  We pulled up a report by FAIR, a right-wing think tank that focuses on immigration, which [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=270.72s)]
*  claims that the net drain of illegal immigration on the country is over $150 billion. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=275.16s)]
*  They list out a bunch of programs that they say give money to undocumented immigrants, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=280.8s)]
*  but these numbers are misleading. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  FAIR arrived at the $150 billion figure by taking the funding for different federal programs [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=286.44s)]
*  and saying that the proportion of undocumented people in these programs represents the economic [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  drain of undocumented people. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=295.68s)]
*  So for example, they say that the U.S. allocates $17.5 billion to low-income schools, and undocumented [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  immigrants compose around 20% of students in low-income schools. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=303.84s)]
*  Therefore, the economic burden for this budget item, they say, is $3 billion. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=306.88s)]
*  But this methodology is flawed because it looks at a snapshot of the moment when immigrants [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=311.32s)]
*  arrive but doesn't account for their net contribution over time. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=315.44s)]
*  The data shows that they end up contributing more to the system than they end up taking, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=318.76s)]
*  due largely to the fact that immigrants are legally forbidden from receiving most government [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=322.64s)]
*  benefits but still pay taxes. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=326.44s)]
*  Furthermore, data shows that second-generation immigrants are actually the highest-net taxpayers [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=328.8s)]
*  and contribute more to the system than people with two U.S.-born parents. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=333.4s)]
*  They tend to be higher-educated and have higher average incomes, making their tax payments [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=337.2s)]
*  higher. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  Most immigrants contribute a net positive income to the country over the course of their [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  life, which would, according to the right-wing's own logic, be a reason to let more immigrants [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=345.12s)]
*  into the country and let them stay. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=349.44s)]
*  But the most relevant piece of information regarding this issue is why immigrants come [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  to the United States in the first place. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=355.4s)]
*  Most of the immigrants coming to the U.S. illegally are coming from Mexico, Guatemala, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=357.44s)]
*  Honduras, India, and El Salvador, countries that have been decimated by globalization. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=361.52s)]
*  Latin American immigration to the U.S. starts to rise in the 80s but explodes in the 1990s, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  specifically after NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, a trade deal which not [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=372.32s)]
*  only made it cheaper for companies to hire Mexican labor, destroying tens of thousands [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=376.64s)]
*  of American jobs, but also undercut the livelihood of millions of Mexican farmers who had no [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=380.96s)]
*  choice but to come to the U.S. to find work. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=386.2s)]
*  On top of that, the U.S. also just straight up destroys countries through covert coups [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=388.64000000000004s)]
*  and dirty wars. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=392.5s)]
*  In 2009, the Obama administration backed a coup that overthrew Manuel Zelaya, the progressive [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=393.68s)]
*  president of Honduras. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=398.66s)]
*  Zelaya wasn't a radical by any means, but he was a stabilizing force. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  After Zelaya was taken out, the void was filled by right-wing politicians who sold off Honduras' [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=405.0s)]
*  industries and resources to transnational corporations, destroying entire industries [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  of the economy and causing poverty to skyrocket. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  The people who took over were also clearly tied to drug trafficking, like Juan Orlando [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=417.18s)]
*  Hernandez, who's currently facing drug trafficking charges in the U.S. after his brother got [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=421.14s)]
*  sentenced to life in prison in the U.S. for drug trafficking just a few years ago. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=425.90000000000003s)]
*  You hear Republicans talk all the time about the drug cartels, prosecuting the cartels, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=430.52s)]
*  cracking down on the cartels. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=435.18s)]
*  Trump even once said that he wanted to airstrike the cartels in Mexico. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=436.82s)]
*  But what you'll never hear is that it was a U.S.-backed coup that put the cartels in [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=440.46000000000004s)]
*  power in Honduras. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=444.34000000000003s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=445.98s)]
*  Both the Obama and Trump administrations had great relations with Honduras' narco-dictator [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=446.98s)]
*  when he was president. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=451.82s)]
*  A lot of people at the rally were asking why there were so many military-age males coming [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=452.94s)]
*  to the U.S., or why they were all claiming refugee status, or why there were drugs coming [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=456.82s)]
*  across the border. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=461.3s)]
*  And the answer's simple. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=462.3s)]
*  We destroyed their country, we destroyed their industries, put drug cartels in power, and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=464.02000000000004s)]
*  now people are fleeing the cartels. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=468.66s)]
*  There's also been a lot of discussion about Haiti. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=470.06s)]
*  Trump notoriously called it a shithole country, and the Biden administration has been telling [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=472.70000000000005s)]
*  Haitian immigrants not to come to the U.S. because they'll be turned away. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=476.74s)]
*  But again, the question to ask is why Haitians are leaving their country in the first place. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=480.42s)]
*  A lot of people will remember how the Clinton Foundation squandered Haiti's earthquake [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=485.02s)]
*  relief funds and handed out multi-million-dollar contracts to their friends in a self-proclaimed [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=488.58s)]
*  gold rush of government contracts signed during the rebuilding effort. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=493.22s)]
*  But a year prior, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton lobbied on behalf of U.S. corporations [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=496.7s)]
*  to lower Haiti's minimum wage from 61 cents an hour to 24 cents an hour, saying it would [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=501.42s)]
*  have quote, a significant impact on business. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=507.7s)]
*  The Bush administration led a coup against John Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's most popular [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=511.02000000000004s)]
*  president ever. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=515.26s)]
*  They basically just kidnapped him. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=516.46s)]
*  And before Bush, Bill Clinton forced Haiti to drop its rice tariffs and then dumped American [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=518.34s)]
*  rice there, wiping out rice farmers in Haiti, a policy Clinton had to publicly apologize [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=522.86s)]
*  for but never actually rectify. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=527.7s)]
*  And today, the Biden administration is supporting the rule of Ari Elan Rhee, a man who was never [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=530.26s)]
*  elected by the Haitian people and serves as a proto-dictator. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=534.54s)]
*  So it should come as no surprise that hundreds of thousands of Haitians have come to the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=537.9399999999999s)]
*  U.S. seeking refuge when we've steadily destroyed their economy over the course of decades. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=541.86s)]
*  When we pointed this out at the rally, a few people told us that there are just some crappy [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=547.38s)]
*  countries out there and that people have a responsibility to make their countries better. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=550.8199999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of crappy countries out there. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=555.06s)]
*  Everybody wants to come here. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=557.62s)]
*  Here's the difference between America and those countries. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=559.18s)]
*  In this country, 245 years ago, we stood up and said, no, we're going to change this. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=561.5799999999999s)]
*  The folks that are coming here decided not to stay in their country and change it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=567.0999999999999s)]
*  Things were hard, but instead they ran away. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=570.6999999999999s)]
*  But it wasn't the Haitian people that destroyed their own rice industry or lowered their own [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=573.02s)]
*  minimum wage. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=577.02s)]
*  They're not responsible for that. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=578.02s)]
*  It was the United States, specifically these transnational corporations and the politicians [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=579.5799999999999s)]
*  that they've bribed into doing their bidding. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=584.26s)]
*  The truth is, it's U.S. foreign policy that's causing the migrant crisis. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=586.46s)]
*  It's no coincidence that the three countries experiencing the largest refugee crisis in [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=590.1s)]
*  the world right now are countries the U.S. has relentlessly waged war against, Syria, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=594.7s)]
*  Afghanistan, and Ukraine. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=599.34s)]
*  We raised this with several people at the rally, and a lot of people agreed. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=600.98s)]
*  You know, how many refugees? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=604.0600000000001s)]
*  I watched a Syrian refugee who is in Africa. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=605.0600000000001s)]
*  He would literally, when he had battery available, he would show us bombing. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=608.5s)]
*  And he talked about Biden bombing and all the bombings that just the U.S. even did prior [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=612.62s)]
*  to Biden, right? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=617.18s)]
*  But now it's really bad. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=618.18s)]
*  And he said, he said, I told you that Biden was a warmonger and this was going to happen. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=620.18s)]
*  If you're trying to say, are we to blame for Syrian refugees coming over here and all that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=624.46s)]
*  stuff, let me say, if you want to do an interview on our foreign policy, that's a whole other [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=628.38s)]
*  conversation. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=632.9s)]
*  I would love to have that with you because you bring up extremely valid points. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=633.9s)]
*  A lot of people at this rally seem genuinely frustrated by the feeling that their government [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=637.66s)]
*  had abandoned them. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=641.58s)]
*  And that's pretty fair. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=642.58s)]
*  The cost of living has reached all time highs, and people work and work and work without [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=644.34s)]
*  ever getting their head above water. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=648.74s)]
*  But their anger would be far more productive if it were directed at the Pentagon's policy [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=650.54s)]
*  of imperial domination and world policing, which is not only the biggest drain on taxpayers [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=654.86s)]
*  in this country by far, but the reason this migrant crisis is even happening to begin [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=659.98s)]
*  with. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=664.62s)]
*  One thing that we kept hearing over and over again was that it felt like this immigration [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=665.62s)]
*  issue was meant to divide and conquer. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=668.86s)]
*  I feel like we have more in common with the people that are fleeing these horrible places, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=671.0600000000001s)]
*  you know, fleeing this violence. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=677.02s)]
*  I feel like we have more in common with them. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=678.22s)]
*  And it's really these banks, these corporations that are setting up all these policies. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=679.82s)]
*  They're really the enemy. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=685.9s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=687.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=688.26s)]
*  If you've got them busy hating each other, they're too busy to see the problem. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=689.26s)]
*  Divide us by our skin color, divide us by our linguistics, divide us by our education. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=692.26s)]
*  It's just un-boring. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=698.0600000000001s)]
*  It's always the same group of the haves trying to dictate to everybody else who wants to [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=699.7399999999999s)]
*  be a have. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=705.8599999999999s)]
*  There's enough pie. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=706.8599999999999s)]
*  We can make as many pies as we want. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=707.8599999999999s)]
*  There is no shortage of resources. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=710.8599999999999s)]
*  That's all their control. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=713.8599999999999s)]
*  We have more in common than we do with the people dictating there should be a crisis [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=715.8599999999999s)]
*  down there. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=720.8599999999999s)]
*  This is divide and conquer. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=721.8599999999999s)]
*  The corporations that ripped apart Honduras, that ripped apart Haiti, that are currently [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=723.3399999999999s)]
*  pumping Syrian gas and shipping it back to the U.S. want nothing more than poor people [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=727.58s)]
*  blaming even poorer people for the problems that they created. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=732.6600000000001s)]
*  These companies are the ones that really don't respect borders. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=736.22s)]
*  They're the real globalists. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=738.7800000000001s)]
*  They're not loyal to their employees. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=740.1800000000001s)]
*  They're not loyal to any country. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=741.7s)]
*  Just money. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=743.9000000000001s)]
*  The second they find people who will work for less than you, they fire you. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=744.9000000000001s)]
*  Even if you work for them for 10 or 20 years, they fire you based on some mathematical formula [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=748.58s)]
*  and set up shops somewhere else. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=753.58s)]
*  And funny enough, some of these billionaires who are the loudest ones railing against immigrant [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=755.14s)]
*  labor and railing against outsourcing are the ones hiring immigrant laborers and outsourcing [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=759.58s)]
*  jobs to China and Mexico when it's profitable for them. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=764.3s)]
*  People on both sides of the border have been wronged by the same tiny group of elites who [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=767.8199999999999s)]
*  are watching us all fight over their crumbs while they make off with a boat loaded full [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=772.14s)]
*  of pies. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=776.58s)]
*  Their greatest fear is that we realize we're being conned, that we realize that immigrants [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=777.58s)]
*  and it's actually them, the corporations that have been pitting us against each other [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=782.46s)]
*  all along. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=786.1800000000001s)]
*  Immigrants after all are just workers, like us. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=787.46s)]
*  They're just from another city. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=789.7s)]
*  They work hard like we do, they're supporting families like we do, and above all, they're [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=791.46s)]
*  getting screwed by the same companies that screw us. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=795.5s)]
*  Corporate profits are at their highest level in 70 years. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=798.86s)]
*  They're literally raking in hundreds of billions of dollars of our hard-earned money, and these [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=801.98s)]
*  same companies are trying to tell us that the people coming to this country with nothing [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=806.02s)]
*  but what they can carry on their backs are the problem. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=810.18s)]
*  It's scapegoating, and both parties, which are controlled by these same corporations, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=813.14s)]
*  are participating in it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=817.5799999999999s)]
*  This is also important because there was a clear presence of neo-Confederate and neo-Nazi [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=819.06s)]
*  groups who were at this rally trying to push the working class into an actual war with [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=823.0999999999999s)]
*  immigrants. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=827.9399999999999s)]

*  There's a crisis of imperialism being sponsored and paid for by transnational corporations, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=835.86s)]
*  but there's no invasion. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=841.14s)]
*  This war that the fascist right is trying to push American workers into would be the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=842.5600000000001s)]

*  They want us to fight amongst each other. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=848.38s)]
*  They want to divide us so we're right for conquer, which is why the billionaire class [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzPJ10sW9I&t=850.28s)]
