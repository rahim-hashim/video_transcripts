# The US Wants to Make Ukraine a Colony
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY)
*  The US is turning Ukraine into a colony. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=0.0s)]
*  At least, that's the gist of the agreement the US and Ukraine are about to sign. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=2.4s)]
*  The full details of the deal haven't been decided yet, but the idea is that Ukraine [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  will have to pay back a huge portion of the aid used to sustain the war through sales [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=10.88s)]
*  of its rare earth minerals, like lithium and titanium, as well as oil and natural gas. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=15.84s)]
*  Congress committed a total of $175 billion in so-called aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=21.64s)]
*  In exchange for paying back the US, Ukraine is going to getâ€¦ well, we're really not [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=27.88s)]
*  sure yet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=32.8s)]
*  Because Ukraine has said there's no clear security guarantee in the deal, and it seems [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=33.96s)]
*  like the underlying implication is that Ukraine's incentive to sign is that the US won't let [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=37.48s)]
*  Ukraine sit at the negotiating table if it doesn't pay up. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  Aid to Ukraine ended up being one of the least popular policies of the Biden administration, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=45.28s)]
*  and felt like a stab in the back at a time when tens of millions of Americans were struggling [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=50.04s)]
*  to survive. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  The Biden administration justified it by saying that the United States had a responsibility [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=55.82s)]
*  to protect Ukraine from Russian invasion. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=59.84s)]
*  But that's deceptive at best. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=62.54s)]
*  The aid to Ukraine wasn't aid. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=65.2s)]
*  It was weapons. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=67.66s)]
*  They were weapons shipments that the US sent to Ukraine to fight a proxy war against Russia [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=68.66s)]
*  that it's been waging for decades. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=73.3s)]
*  During the Cold War, the United States and Russia, then the Soviet Union, were engaged [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=75.78s)]
*  in a worldwide struggle between their dueling systems, capitalism and communism. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=80.26s)]
*  In order to contain the Soviet Union, the US along with its Western European allies [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=85.18s)]
*  formed a military alliance called NATO, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=89.78s)]
*  According to Article 5 of NATO's treaty, any attack on a NATO country would trigger [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=94.66000000000001s)]
*  a response from all of NATO. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=99.22000000000001s)]
*  Now since NATO was an anti-Soviet alliance, you might be thinking that there would be [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  no need for NATO after the Cold War. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=105.62s)]
*  But it was continued, because the US found itself as the sole superpower left in the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=108.58000000000001s)]
*  world after the Cold War, and decided that it was going to maintain its superpower status [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=113.38s)]
*  by destroying any power that might rise to challenge it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=117.7s)]
*  One of those powers ended up being Russia. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=121.5s)]
*  Despite repeated promises from the US that NATO wouldn't expand in their own words, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=124.34s)]
*  one inch eastwards, NATO expanded into several Eastern European countries, further tightening [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=129.3s)]
*  the noose around Russia that it created during the Cold War. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=135.0s)]
*  NATO expansion created obvious security concerns for Russia. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=138.5s)]
*  NATO countries play host to massive military bases and advanced US weapons that would now [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=142.42s)]
*  be right on Russia's doorstep. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=146.88s)]
*  Furthermore, NATO countries practice huge joint military exercises where they simulate [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=149.45999999999998s)]
*  full-blown ground invasions which could only be interpreted as practice runs for invading [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=154.42s)]
*  Russia. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=159.89999999999998s)]
*  And if Russia objected or had a dispute with any of its neighbors, it would trigger a direct [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  conflict between Russia and all of NATO. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=165.1s)]
*  On the issue of NATO expansion, Ukraine was Russia's red line. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=168.62s)]
*  Ukraine has a large economy and shares a massive border with Russia. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=173.26s)]
*  Despite this, the US spent decades meddling in Ukrainian politics to put pro-NATO politicians [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=177.26s)]
*  in power. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=182.66s)]
*  In 2004, the US spent tens of millions of dollars sponsoring a pro-EU, pro-Western candidate [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=183.66s)]
*  in the Ukrainian presidential election who was not only a friend of George W. Bush, but [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=190.62s)]
*  whose wife was actually a former employee at the US State Department. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=195.44s)]
*  The US flooded money into the US Agency for International Development's Democracy Program [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=199.56s)]
*  in Ukraine, which is essentially a euphemism for supporting political factions that hold [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=204.24s)]
*  pro-US views. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=208.72s)]
*  Even though the US-backed candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, lost the initial election, pro-Western [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  forces were able to cast doubt on the election results and force a new election, which Yushchenko [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=215.7s)]
*  won. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=220.56s)]
*  In 2014, the US employed the same playbook, openly funding Ukrainian protest groups who [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=222.32s)]
*  opposed the Ukrainian president at the time, Viktor Yanukovych. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=226.72s)]
*  Even though Yanukovych just wanted Ukraine to maintain a neutral position between the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=231.0s)]
*  EU and Russia, US politicians tried to frame this as Yanukovych being a Russian stooge. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=234.72s)]
*  Ukrainian Nazi groups like Right Sector, C-14 and Svoboda spearheaded the coup, ran Yanukovych [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=240.52s)]
*  out of the presidential palace and appointed themselves to key government positions in [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=246.62s)]
*  the new regime. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=250.84s)]
*  Since the 2014 coup, Western leaders repeatedly flirted with the idea of admitting Ukraine [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  to NATO, which was ultimately the reason Russia decided to invade Ukraine. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=257.2s)]
*  Listening to the US corporate media, you'd think Putin just woke up one day and decided [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=261.40000000000003s)]
*  he wanted to invade another country because he's that evil. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=265.76s)]
*  What you'll never hear is that for 30 years, the United States and NATO repeatedly violated [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=269.04s)]
*  their agreements, encircled Russia with weapons and military bases, and overthrew governments [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=274.64s)]
*  in its neighboring countries. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=280.02s)]
*  The Russian invasion gave the West exactly what it was looking for, an excuse to start [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=281.85999999999996s)]
*  a direct armed conflict with Russia. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=286.7s)]
*  And the best part for the West was that Ukrainians, not US or NATO troops, would be the ones doing [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=289.38s)]
*  all the fighting. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=295.02s)]
*  This is why we say the aid the US sent wasn't aid. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=296.94s)]
*  They were paying Ukrainians to be cannon fodder in their dirty war. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=300.9s)]
*  US President Joe Biden's administration is urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=304.82s)]
*  of its military by drafting younger troops. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=309.58s)]
*  A senior official says the Biden administration wants Ukraine to lower the mobilization age [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=312.46s)]
*  from 25 to 18 to help expand the pool of fighting age men available. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=317.3s)]
*  So to summarize, the US tries to permanently weaken the Russian government, orchestrates [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=322.38s)]
*  regime change coups in neighboring countries, fails to achieve its objectives, violates [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=327.18s)]
*  all of Russia's red lines in the process, and then uses Ukrainians as mercenaries to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=332.41999999999996s)]
*  fight a proxy war against Russia. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=338.1s)]
*  And now, the Ukrainian people, who fought and bled to advance the interests of the US [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=340.46000000000004s)]
*  military industrial complex, are going to be sent to mines for generations to pay back [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=345.22s)]
*  the US for this aid. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=350.82000000000005s)]
*  By the way, half the money from this mineral fund is supposed to go to Ukrainian reconstruction [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=352.98s)]
*  efforts, but we already know that that money is going to be siphoned away by corporations. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=358.1s)]
*  In 2023, Vladimir Zelensky made a statement declaring that Ukraine was open for business. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=362.54s)]
*  In the statement, he thanks JP Morgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs for taking part in the Ukrainian [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  reconstruction effort, which Zelensky said would be the largest European economic project [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  of our time. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=380.5s)]
*  We have already managed to attract attention and have cooperation with such giants of the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=381.5s)]
*  international financial and investment world as BlackRock, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=387.9s)]
*  such American brands as Starlink or Westinghouse, have already become part of our Ukrainian [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=395.02s)]
*  way. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=401.78s)]
*  Your brilliant defense systems, such as High Mars or Red Lays, are already uniting our [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=402.78s)]
*  history of freedom with your enterprises. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=410.9s)]
*  In other words, Zelensky's plan has always been to sell off the country's assets. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=414.42s)]
*  Here's an actual video that the Ukrainian government made about the future Ukraine, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  complete with AI courts and an ultra-modern Iron Dome. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=423.02000000000004s)]
*  2030. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=427.94s)]
*  The history of the new Ukraine is studied all over the globe. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=429.58000000000004s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=433.34000000000003s)]
*  Because Ukraine became the most digital and convenient country in the world. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  Scripps have replaced bureaucrats. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=438.54s)]
*  500,000 former public servants are successfully integrated in the new economy. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=440.42s)]
*  No more red tape. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=445.3s)]
*  But paperless. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=446.78000000000003s)]
*  No more banknotes. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=447.86s)]
*  But cashless. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=449.34000000000003s)]
*  Yes, we became the first country to abandon paper money. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  Ukraine now has the best tax system for the IT industry and the most affordable e-residency. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=454.5s)]
*  Thanks to Ukrainian engineers and programmers, the R&D centers of the world's top technology [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=459.70000000000005s)]
*  companies operate successfully, and Ukraine ranks first in the world by the number of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=464.58000000000004s)]
*  startups per capita. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=469.02s)]
*  Ukrainian courts are guided by artificial intelligence, and all notarial acts take place online. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=470.62s)]
*  So no, the US should have never sent aid to Ukraine, but they should have also never waged [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=476.46s)]
*  a dirty war against Russia. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=481.7s)]
*  The whole idea that the United States has to be the most powerful country in the world, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=483.94s)]
*  or that it has to police the world, is the costliest policy the United States is embarking [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=488.02s)]
*  on right now. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=493.5s)]
*  There are over 800 US military bases around the world, and hundreds of thousands of troops [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=494.66s)]
*  stationed overseas. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=499.66s)]
*  If Donald Trump was serious about cutting spending on overseas conflicts, he would close [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=501.22s)]
*  these bases and bring these troops home. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=506.7s)]
*  Instead of sinking hundreds of billions of dollars into undermining foreign governments, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt03lAdbKyY&t=509.66s)]
