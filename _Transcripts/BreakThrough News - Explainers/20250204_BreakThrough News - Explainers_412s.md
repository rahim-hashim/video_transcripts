# US Reading Test Scores Fall to Lowest Level in 32 Years
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw)
*  Kids in the US can't read. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=0.0s)]
*  At least that's what the latest national report card, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=2.0s)]
*  called the National Assessment of Educational Progress, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=4.8s)]
*  revealed this past week. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=7.34s)]
*  The data, which comes from a biannual standardized [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=8.8s)]
*  testing program overseen by the US Department of Education, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=11.26s)]
*  found that reading levels among fourth and eighth graders [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=14.96s)]
*  have hit the lowest level in 32 years. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=17.76s)]
*  According to the data, only 31% of fourth graders [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=20.76s)]
*  and 30% of eighth graders met their proficiency standard. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  The number of students who scored below the lowest skill [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=28.6s)]
*  level, which is called the basic level, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=30.8s)]
*  was the largest in the history of these report cards. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=33.16s)]
*  These results are just the latest in a long decline [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=36.36s)]
*  of reading scores that began in 2015. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=38.96s)]
*  Now, if you're surprised to be hearing this, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  I don't blame you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=43.44s)]
*  This is an issue we almost never hear about. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  It doesn't even register as an issue in the debates [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=46.96s)]
*  or mainstream political discourse. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=49.2s)]
*  But the amount of illiteracy in the school system [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=50.84s)]
*  is reaching a crisis level, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  and all the experts are raising alarm bells. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=55.0s)]
*  So what's our government proposing to do about this? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=57.6s)]
*  Abolish the Department of Education. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=60.32s)]
*  Yes, that is the stated policy of the newly inaugurated [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=62.92s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=66.72s)]
*  Don't fix the grades in the report card. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=68.06s)]
*  Abolish the agency that issues it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=70.12s)]
*  The Trump administration says they want to do this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=72.52s)]
*  because the DOE has become a bureaucratic indoctrination [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=74.34s)]
*  center controlled by Marxists. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=78.12s)]
*  Of course, this doesn't even make sense when you consider [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=80.48s)]
*  that school curriculum is determined at the state [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=83.12s)]
*  and local level. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  This is clearly fear-mongering, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=86.16s)]
*  meant to bring about their real end game, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=88.0s)]
*  the privatization of public education. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  Trump's pick to lead the Department of Education [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=92.96s)]
*  is Linda McMahon, a billionaire and the former CEO [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=95.32s)]
*  of the World Wrestling Entertainment Production Company. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=98.44s)]
*  Linda McMahon serves as a board member [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=101.24s)]
*  for the America First Policy Institute, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=102.92s)]
*  where her page openly states her intention [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  to replace public schools with school choice, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=107.16s)]
*  which is a euphemism for charter schools [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=109.92s)]
*  and voucher programs. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=112.12s)]
*  Charter schools are schools that are funded [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  with a mix of public and private funds [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=115.14s)]
*  that are said to give parents choice [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=117.22s)]
*  over where their children go to school, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=119.02s)]
*  but in effect, they divert funds [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=121.14s)]
*  from the public school system to these charter schools. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=123.06s)]
*  Even though at face value, charter schools [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=126.26s)]
*  are run not for profit, there have been countless schemes [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=128.18s)]
*  which have been used to funny money from these schools [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=131.32s)]
*  into private hands. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=133.7s)]
*  Voucher programs accelerate this process [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=135.34s)]
*  by offering vouchers to families paid for by taxpayers [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=137.78s)]
*  that can be used to pay for tuition at private schools. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=141.48s)]
*  Again, taking money out of state budgets [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=144.74s)]
*  and putting them in private hands. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=146.88s)]
*  These policies not only drain funds from public schools, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=149.12s)]
*  they also create a tiered education system. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=152.06s)]
*  Republicans claim that charter schools increase test scores, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=155.06s)]
*  and while some studies show a moderate increase, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=158.02s)]
*  this is more to do with the fact that charter schools [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  are based on the exclusion of students [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=162.58s)]
*  based on their applications. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=165.06s)]
*  There's actually an array of millionaire [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  and billionaire-funded organizations [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=168.5s)]
*  that have been working tirelessly [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=170.34s)]
*  to crush the entire public school system. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=171.86s)]
*  An investigation by Documented leaked audio recordings [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=174.1s)]
*  between one of the largest [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=177.02s)]
*  pro-school choice organizations in the country, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=178.18s)]
*  the Alliance Defending Freedom, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=180.82s)]
*  which is a Christian legal organization [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=182.3s)]
*  dedicated to ending legal separation [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=184.94s)]
*  between church and state, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=186.74s)]
*  and one of their mega-donor groups [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=188.34s)]
*  where their donors say this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=189.98s)]
*  The fundamental change is to force [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=191.7s)]
*  via a Supreme Court decision [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=194.34s)]
*  a constitutionally mandated school voucher system. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=197.02s)]
*  Documents exchanged between these groups [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=201.94s)]
*  also revealed that ADF wanted to take advantage [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=203.78s)]
*  of new curriculums that talked about racism and homophobia [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=205.9s)]
*  to serve as the legal basis for a Supreme Court decision [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=209.54s)]
*  to constitutionally mandate school choice. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=212.58s)]
*  It should come as no surprise [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=215.26s)]
*  that a bunch of millionaires and billionaires [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=216.9s)]
*  trying to defund public schools [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=218.86s)]
*  has more to do with politics and profit [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=220.62s)]
*  than educating children. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=222.62s)]
*  But on an even simpler level, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=224.06s)]
*  what is this idea that spending less money on schools [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  is somehow gonna make them better? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=230.16s)]
*  Conservatives will often throw out the fact [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=232.26s)]
*  that Americans spend more on education [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  than any country in the world, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=235.66s)]
*  but this is misleading [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=237.29999999999998s)]
*  because it includes the money we spend on college, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=238.62s)]
*  which is ridiculously expensive because it's privatized. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=241.5s)]
*  The truth is we're actually not spending enough on schools. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=245.98s)]
*  During the pandemic, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=249.22s)]
*  Congress allocated nearly $200 billion to public schools [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=250.38s)]
*  to combat the massive disruption that COVID caused. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  The money was used to hire more teachers [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=257.42s)]
*  and create after-school and summer programs, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  which are proven to increase academic performance. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=261.34s)]
*  Two separate studies of the congressional aid [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=264.26s)]
*  found the exact same thing, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=266.08s)]
*  that the aid improved test scores, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=268.06s)]
*  but that the scale of it wasn't nearly enough. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=269.7s)]
*  One study estimated that an additional $13,000 per pupil [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=272.34s)]
*  was needed to get students back [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=276.58s)]
*  to pre-pandemic testing levels. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=278.35999999999996s)]
*  Despite this, congressional Republicans [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=280.2s)]
*  just put forward a bill [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=282.34s)]
*  to cut public education funding by billions of dollars. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=283.58s)]
*  And the money they're going after [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=287.38s)]
*  doesn't even have to do with certain teachers [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=288.82s)]
*  or other curriculum [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=292.02s)]
*  like they claim they have a problem with. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=292.86s)]
*  They're cutting money from school lunch programs [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=294.1s)]
*  for low-income students. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=296.98s)]
*  The Republicans are proposing cuts [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  that would kick 12 million children [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=300.3s)]
*  off of a program that provides free lunch [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=302.54s)]
*  at a time when enrollment in this program is increasing. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=305.18s)]
*  This is what Trump's billionaire cabinet [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=308.54s)]
*  is trying to tell us will fix schools. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=310.38s)]
*  Fire the teachers and then starve the kids. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=312.38s)]
*  And when I was in high school, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=315.3s)]
*  I worked my entire way through. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=316.22s)]
*  You're telling me that kids who stay at home [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=317.36s)]
*  instead of going to work at Burger King [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=319.5s)]
*  and McDonald's during the summer [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=321.26s)]
*  should stay at home and get their free lunch [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=322.74s)]
*  instead of going to work. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=324.7s)]
*  Hunger and poverty are not at all [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=325.54s)]
*  an insignificant part of this story. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=327.22s)]
*  Not too long ago, it came out that one in eight students [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=329.26s)]
*  in New York City public schools was homeless. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=332.42s)]
*  Nationwide, one in six children lives in poverty [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=335.02s)]
*  with nearly one in five facing hunger. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=338.3s)]
*  Is it any surprise that kids are having trouble reading [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=340.46s)]
*  when they don't even know [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=344.06s)]
*  where their next meal will come from? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=344.88s)]
*  Well, Trump and all his oligarch friends [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0spTMKCzw&t=346.62s)]
