While the rest of the world celebrates International Workers Day, today is technically Loyalty Day in the US, a holiday for "reaffirming loyalty to the United States."

# The Anti-Communist Holiday Invented to Hide the History of Socialism in the U.S.
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [May 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g)
*  Did you know that today is Loyalty Day? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, May 1st of every year is a federally recognized US holiday called Loyalty Day, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=2.2600000000000002s)]
*  but almost nobody knows about it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=7.62s)]
*  The official stated purpose of Loyalty Day is quote, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=9.42s)]
*  For the reaffirmation of loyalty to the United States, and for the recognition of the heritage [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=12.06s)]
*  of American freedom. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=16.68s)]
*  As weird as this might be, the strangest thing about Loyalty Day is that it's basically [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  a fake holiday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=22.66s)]
*  It was invented solely for the purpose of hiding the real May 1st holiday, a socialist [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=24.2s)]
*  holiday called International Workers Day, or May Day. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=28.66s)]
*  Here's what happened. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=31.62s)]
*  On May 1st of every year, people in basically every country in the world celebrate International [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=32.74s)]
*  Workers Day. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=37.58s)]
*  It's a holiday that celebrates how the working class produces the wealth of society, and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=38.58s)]
*  how it has to fight tooth and nail against the capitalist system for the basic rights [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=42.72s)]
*  we take for granted today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=46.94s)]
*  The first May Day was inspired by the fight for the 8 hour workday. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=48.44s)]
*  Nowadays, we tend to take for granted that most workplaces only expect us to work for [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=51.58s)]
*  8 hours. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=55.379999999999995s)]
*  But for large parts of the 18th and 19th century, it was actually more common for people to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=56.38s)]
*  work 10 hours a day, or 11 hours a day, or even 12 hours a day. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=60.7s)]
*  On top of that, payback then was really low. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=65.8s)]
*  So low that a significant number of families needed their children to work just to make [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  ends meet. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=72.42s)]
*  The work was also incredibly dangerous. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=73.42s)]
*  Companies had no responsibility to protect their workers, and people dying on the job [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=76.1s)]
*  was just thought of as the way things were. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=79.84s)]
*  Basically, if you were a worker back then, you had no rights. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=82.22s)]
*  You were essentially your employer's property, and he could do whatever he wanted to you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=85.76s)]
*  just because he paid you a few pennies an hour. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=89.2s)]
*  In 1884, a convention of labor unions in the United States and Canada decided to respond [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=91.76s)]
*  to these awful working conditions, and declared that on May 1st, all workers and labor unions [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=96.76s)]
*  should hold demonstrations to say, we want an 8 hour workday now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=101.94s)]
*  And that's exactly what they did. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=106.04s)]
*  On May 1st, 1886, 500,000 workers across the U.S. demonstrated. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  In Chicago in particular, the demonstrations were so strong that 65,000 workers went on [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=112.76s)]
*  strike for days, well into May 3rd. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  Frustrated that their workers were refusing to work, Chicago industrialists hired outside [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=121.2s)]
*  workers to replace their striking workers. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=125.78s)]
*  These outside workers, who are also known as scabs, were trying to leave the McCormick [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=128.26s)]
*  Reaper Works plant when the striking workers confronted them, and basically called them [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=132.52s)]
*  out for helping the capitalists break the workers' strike. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=136.86s)]
*  A fight ensued, and the police opened fire on the striking workers, killing four of them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=139.56s)]
*  In response to the killings, the striking Chicago workers organized a rally for the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=144.18s)]
*  next day in Haymarket Square. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=147.68s)]
*  3,000 people attended that rally. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=149.52s)]
*  As the rally was ending, the police ordered the workers to disperse, and then someone [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=152.24s)]
*  in the crowd responded by throwing a bomb. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=156.12s)]
*  The police responded to the bomb by shooting the protesters, and the police ended up wounding [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=158.66000000000003s)]
*  200 people and killing several. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=163.0s)]
*  Hundreds of workers were arrested and eight radical labor leaders were put on trial. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=165.52s)]
*  All eight were convicted, and of the eight, four were hanged and two were sentenced to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=170.4s)]
*  life in prison. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=174.62s)]
*  After the executions, the government attacked labor leaders and terrorized the growing movement. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=175.96s)]
*  But a few years later, the labor movement rebounded. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=181.16000000000003s)]
*  There was an outpouring of national and international solidarity with the Haymarket protesters, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  and the ones who died were being considered martyrs. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=188.56s)]
*  In 1890, May 1st was declared International Workers' Day. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=190.94s)]
*  So where does Loyalty Day fit into this? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=195.04s)]
*  Well, the first Loyalty Day was declared in 1921, just four years after the first socialist [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=197.44s)]
*  revolution in the world, the Russian Revolution. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=202.73999999999998s)]
*  Now, it's impossible to understate just how much the Russian Revolution scared the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  capitalist classes, because this was basically an event where a bunch of peasants and factory [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=209.44s)]
*  workers rose up and kicked industrialists, bankers, and aristocrats out of power. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=214.16s)]
*  So when the rich capitalists in other countries saw what was happening in Russia, they thought [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=220.2s)]
*  that the poor people in their own countries were going to do the same thing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=224.86s)]
*  So when the socialists seized power in Russia, 14 capitalist countries, many of which were [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=228.26000000000002s)]
*  actually at war with each other at the time, put aside all of their differences to invade [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=232.94000000000003s)]
*  Russia just to stop this socialist revolution. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  As Winston Churchill put it, the goal was to quote, strangle the Bolshevik baby in its [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=240.5s)]
*  crib. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=245.3s)]
*  On top of this, these countries also unleashed a wave of police repression against socialists [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=246.3s)]
*  in their own countries. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=250.08s)]
*  After the Russian Revolution, the United States enters this period known as the First Red [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=251.58s)]
*  Scare. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=255.46s)]
*  During this time, it was basically illegal to be a socialist. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=256.5s)]
*  The government passed a law called the 1918 Sedition Act, which made it a crime to criticize [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=259.98s)]
*  the government at the threat of deportation. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=264.62s)]
*  Thousands of people were arrested just for being sympathetic to socialism, or even for [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=268.24s)]
*  just being union leaders. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=272.1s)]
*  The attorney general at the time famously warned that there were 300,000 communists [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=273.66s)]
*  hiding in the United States, something he offered no proof for. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=278.58s)]
*  The insurrection never happened, but in this crazed state of anti-communist frenzy, the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=281.9s)]
*  US declared that May 1st would from then on out be known as Loyalty Day, and the first [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=286.7s)]
*  Loyalty Day was celebrated on May 1st, 1921. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=291.3s)]
*  The capitalist class fears May Day, because historically, radical holidays like May Day [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=294.62s)]
*  have led to much larger events like revolutions. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=299.38s)]
*  In 1905, May Day strikes in Russia breathed life back into the labor movement and spread [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=302.34s)]
*  this revolutionary sentiment that would lead to the 1905 revolution in Russia that ended [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=307.3s)]
*  Tsarist absolutism. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=312.3s)]
*  On International Women's Day, another socialist holiday, tens of thousands of Russian women [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=313.76s)]
*  marched in the streets against war and poverty, catalyzing the February Revolution of 1917, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=318.66s)]
*  the revolution that preceded the socialist October Revolution that took place later that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=324.44s)]
*  year. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=328.42s)]
*  So, Loyalty Day was basically a way of erasing this history, and denying us this day that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=329.42s)]
*  historically, we've used to express how much we hate capitalism. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=333.78s)]
*  The ironic thing about all this is that basically every country in the world has massive demonstrations [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=337.61999999999995s)]
*  for May Day and International Women's Day, except for the United States, the country [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=342.84s)]
*  that started both of these holidays. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=347.4s)]
*  Americans tend to get stereotyped as these super pro-capitalist people that are all selfish [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=350.05999999999995s)]
*  or that we all want to be millionaires, but actually, we started two of the most widely [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=354.29999999999995s)]
*  celebrated radical holidays in the world, and the history of socialism in this country [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=358.85999999999996s)]
*  is as deep as any other. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=363.22s)]
*  A lot of people that were taught about in school, like Martin Luther King, Helen Keller, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=364.82000000000005s)]
*  Albert Einstein, were all socialists. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=369.46000000000004s)]
*  They don't tell us this because then we might not think socialism is all that bad, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=371.98s)]
*  but yes, these people, on top of everything else they did, supported socialism. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=375.70000000000005s)]
*  While you almost never hear about it, Loyalty Day is actually still celebrated every single [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=380.26000000000005s)]
*  year. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=385.22s)]
*  Every year, the president issues a proclamation proclaiming that May 1st is Loyalty Day. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=386.22s)]
*  In fact, Joe Biden has already done that for May 1st this year. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=390.94s)]
*  And while you might feel like rolling your eyes at that, no amount of proclamations will [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=394.08s)]
*  change the fact that May 1st is International Workers Day. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=397.78s)]
*  Furthermore, no amount of calls for loyalty will change the fact that capitalism has created [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=401.26s)]
*  a world where five billionaires own more than the poorest four billion people in the world [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=406.26s)]
*  combined, where half of Americans are in or near poverty while billionaires are doubling [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=411.1s)]
*  and tripling their wealth. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=415.56s)]
*  Loyalty Day doesn't change the fact that capitalism can't even solve the most basic [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=417.62s)]
*  problems like feeding and housing everyone. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=421.4s)]
*  The capitalist class hides May Day from us because it reminds us that the rule of billionaires [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=424.16s)]
*  in society can only exist as long as the workers feel atomized and divided. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=428.5s)]
*  As soon as the working class comes together and makes a conscious decision to withdraw [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=433.08s)]
*  their labor, society shuts down. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=437.22s)]
*  All of the billionaires that seemed all-powerful just become regular people. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=439.9s)]
*  So the thrust of International Workers Day has always been that it's workers, not CEOs [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=443.66s)]
*  that make the trains run, that prepare the food, that keep the lights on. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  And if that's the case, workers can continue to run society without these parasitic billionaires [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INUqL1JA81g&t=452.5s)]
