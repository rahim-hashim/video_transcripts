# Israel’s Goal Was Always Ethnic Cleansing
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs)
*  Israel's goal has always been ethnic cleansing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=0.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people have been watching what Israel's been doing in Gaza and think [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=3.0s)]
*  to themselves understandably, how could any country do this? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  But what I'm about to tell you will make it absolutely clear that wiping out the Palestinians [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  has been Israel's goal all along. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=14.48s)]
*  It starts with the 19th century movement to create the state of Israel, the Zionist movement. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=16.84s)]
*  While there's nothing wrong in principle with Jews having a homeland, the Zionist movement [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=21.6s)]
*  insisted that a Jewish state had to be in the heart of the Arab world, Palestine. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=25.16s)]
*  The slogan for the Zionist movement was, a land for a people, for a people without a land. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=29.8s)]
*  Of course, Palestine wasn't a land without a people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=34.32s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of Arabs already lived there. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=36.92s)]
*  This immediately created a problem for the Zionist movement. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=39.52s)]
*  Israel couldn't be a Jewish state if the majority of people weren't Jewish. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=42.52s)]
*  The Zionist movement knew that the only way they could actually have a Jewish state in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  Palestine was to kick the Arabs out and move Jews in, and they openly wrote about this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=49.44s)]
*  Leading Zionist Israel Zangwell wrote, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=54.88s)]
*  Another leading Zionist, and future Prime Minister of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, put [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=59.8s)]
*  it more bluntly, saying, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=68.92s)]
*  The Zionist movement was also completely aware that they'd have to take the land by force. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=73.16s)]
*  Another Zionist leader, Zev Jabotinsky, wrote, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=77.32s)]
*  This is how the Arabs will behave so long as they possess a gleam of hope that they [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=89.8s)]
*  can prevent Palestine from becoming the land of Israel. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=95.2s)]
*  This didn't deter the Zionist movement, though. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=98.72s)]
*  Jabotinsky goes on to write, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=101.16s)]
*  Zionism is often mistakenly referred to as a movement for Jewish salvation, but Zionism [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=108.32s)]
*  had a distinct colonial character from its inception. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=113.32s)]
*  Where as most liberation movements involve a group of people ridding themselves of foreign [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=116.44s)]
*  occupiers on their land, Zionists saw themselves as a Western force that would bring civility [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=120.08s)]
*  to the backwards Arab world. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=125.36s)]
*  Leader of the Zionist movement Theodore Herzl wrote, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=127.64s)]
*  If it's God's will that we return to our historic fatherland, we should like to do [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=130.04s)]
*  so as representatives of Western civilization, and bring cleanliness, order, and well-established [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=133.88s)]
*  customs to this plague-ridden, blighted corner of the Orient. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=139.16s)]
*  For decades, Zionism lacked the support of the vast majority of Jews, and relied mostly [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  on ultra-rich aristocratic European families to finance itself. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=148.16s)]
*  To gain traction, the Zionist movement also tried to make itself useful to Europe's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=151.92s)]
*  leading imperialists. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=156.04s)]
*  In 1902, Theodore Herzl wrote a letter to Cecil Rhodes, the infamous British imperialist [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=157.52s)]
*  who carved the British Empire's path through southern Africa. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=162.96s)]
*  In the letter, Herzl wrote, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's think about this for a sec. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  If Zionism really was a liberation movement, why would they seek an alliance with one of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=179.72s)]
*  the greatest oppressors of humankind in history? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  Why would they expect to win his support? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=186.88s)]
*  Almost all of the European imperialists that supported the Zionist movement were motivated [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=188.96s)]
*  by anti-Semitism. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=193.28s)]
*  To them, Zionism was a great excuse to get Jews out of their country. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=194.68s)]
*  The Zionist movement even struck a similar agreement with Nazi Germany. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=198.72s)]
*  While the worldwide Jewish community was boycotting German businesses in the early 30s, the Zionist [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=202.32s)]
*  movement struck an agreement with the Nazis, called the Havarah Agreement. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=207.6s)]
*  It allowed Jews emigrating from Germany to Palestine to exchange their assets for German-made [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=211.12s)]
*  goods, which they then sold and received the proceeds of. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=216.72s)]
*  While Zionism became hegemonic in Jewish communities following the horrors of the Holocaust, Zionism [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=219.36s)]
*  itself and the notion of a Jewish state in Palestine far predate the Holocaust, and were [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=224.72000000000003s)]
*  firmly rooted in the idea that Palestine should be ethnically cleansed to make room for Jewish [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  settlement. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=234.24s)]
*  It's not a coincidence that the day Israelis mark as Israeli Independence Day, May 14th, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=235.24s)]
*  Palestinians remember as the Nakba, or the catastrophe, a series of massacres that forced [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=240.56s)]
*  750,000 Palestinians out of their homes. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=245.0s)]
*  Israel's founding is quite literally synonymous with terror and displacement for Palestinians, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=248.12s)]
*  just as the Zionists said it would be. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=253.08s)]
*  In the words of Israeli General Moshe Dayan, Jewish villages were built in the place of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  Arab villages. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=259.56s)]
*  You don't even know the names of these Arab villages because these geography books no [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=260.56s)]
*  longer exist. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  There's not one single place built in this country that didn't have a former Arab population. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a speech where he described [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=270.35999999999996s)]
*  Israel's expanding war in Gaza as Israel's second war of independence. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=274.68s)]
*  In other words, he's saying that Israel intends to finish what the first war started, the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  expulsion of all Palestinians from historic Palestine. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  To Palestinians, it's obvious what this means. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=287.12s)]
*  A second independence war means a second Nakba. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=289.52s)]
*  The first Nakba turned 750,000 Palestinians into refugees. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=292.2s)]
*  But in just the last four weeks, Israel has created 1.4 million displaced persons in Gaza. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=296.48s)]
*  The Zionist movement has been openly stating their genocidal intent for the Palestinians [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=302.04s)]
*  not just in the last four weeks, not just for the last 75 years, but even before that, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=306.04s)]
*  when the state of Israel was just an idea. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=311.0s)]
*  We know what their end goal is. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=313.32s)]
*  The only question that remains is, this time, will the world let it happen? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNGimPNygs&t=314.88s)]
