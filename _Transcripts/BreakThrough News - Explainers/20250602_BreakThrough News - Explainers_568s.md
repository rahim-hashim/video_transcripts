# Israel is Paying Influencers to Spread Its Propaganda
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI)
*  Israel might be controlling your favorite influencer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's how you spot them. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=2.4s)]
*  When Benjamin Netanyahu came to DC to meet with Trump, most of the attention was focused [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=4.2s)]
*  on their plans for Gaza. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=8.52s)]
*  What completely flew under the radar is that Benjamin Netanyahu had another meeting where [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=10.36s)]
*  he met with a group of conservative influencers. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=14.32s)]
*  The group included podcasters Tim Pool, Dave Rubin, and Sean Spicer, and writers Bethany [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=17.26s)]
*  Mandel, David Harris Jr., Jessica Krauss, Seth Mandel, and Molly Hemingway. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=22.64s)]
*  Some of the people on this list have several millions of followers and they were meeting [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=28.12s)]
*  not just with Israel's head of state, but also his diplomatic advisor and the Israeli [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=31.36s)]
*  ambassador to the United States. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=35.9s)]
*  There are no videos or direct quotes from the meeting because it was conducted under [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=37.4s)]
*  Chatham House Rules, which is basically a rule set for meetings in elite circles where [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=41.260000000000005s)]
*  the people attending, especially journalists, meet on the basis that nothing said in the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=45.84s)]
*  meeting can be directly attributed to any individual and that you can only say what [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  was generally talked about. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=54.0s)]
*  Some of the topics covered include Iran and anti-Zionist sentiment online. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=55.84s)]
*  While we don't know for sure everything that was discussed, it's hard to imagine [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=59.6s)]
*  that Netanyahu convened influencers for any other reason than to try to convince them [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=63.6s)]
*  to be propagandists for Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=68.08s)]
*  So is there any evidence of Israel manipulating online spaces to change public opinion? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=70.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=74.64s)]
*  In fact, it's a stated position of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=75.64s)]
*  Just three days after October 7th, Israel launched an initiative to recruit social media [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=79.76s)]
*  influencers in the United States to defend Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=84.72s)]
*  A spokesperson said, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=87.56s)]
*  It's obvious why Israel needs propaganda. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=101.44s)]
*  The only way to have a country based on legalized racial supremacy is through propaganda like [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=104.2s)]
*  Nazi Germany and Jim Crow apartheid had that twists the reality of the situation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=109.8s)]
*  And Israel actually has its own word for propaganda, which is Hezbollah, which translates to to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=115.32s)]
*  explain in Hebrew. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=120.6s)]
*  In the weeks following October 7th, Israel already had a lot to explain. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=122.6s)]
*  A number of American influencers got emails offering them $5,000 in brand sponsorships [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=126.52s)]
*  in exchange for doing a single livestream supporting Israel. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=132.56s)]
*  The email read, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=136.12s)]
*  There's no telling who organized this collective of agencies or who they were, but it's clear [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=154.44s)]
*  that recruiting influencers is one of the central chosen tactics of the Israeli Hisbar [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=159.72s)]
*  machine. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=164.12s)]
*  The reason influencers are so important is because influencer-based marketing is much [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=165.12s)]
*  more subtle than an ad in a fixed programming slot where you know you're being sold something. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=169.12s)]
*  A lot of this work is done by a network of privately funded NGOs. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=174.88s)]
*  This is because if you have the Israeli government paying influencers, that looks bad. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=178.88s)]
*  But if the Israeli government gets a hundred different NGOs to do the same thing, it gives [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  the illusion that it's not coordinated by a state. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  Take Yola Israel, for example, a non-profit organization dedicated to flying VIP influencers, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=190.48s)]
*  meaning people with 3 million or more online followers, out to Israel on an all-expenses-paid [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=196.88s)]
*  vacation where they go swimming and dancing and shopping and out to restaurants. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=202.16s)]
*  Many of the people that go on this trip don't know anything about Israel and have never [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  posted about it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=212.0s)]
*  They're being taken under the guise of discovering Israel, which might sound innocuous, but the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=213.12s)]
*  way the trips work is that you're being showered with these gifts and fancy dinners [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=218.48s)]
*  and beach trips without any mention of how the Palestinians are treated, and then the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=222.88s)]
*  organizers tell you about how there are these people out there called Palestinians who hate [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=227.2s)]
*  Jews and want to destroy Israel and all the wonderful things you're experiencing on this [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  trip so far. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  Then the organizers coach you on how to post about Israel and how to deal with the anti-Semites, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  meaning people who oppose genocide, in the comments. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=242.48s)]
*  Yola Israel closely monitors how much their influencers post, and they report that the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=245.52s)]
*  average person that takes one of their trips makes 100 posts about Israel while they're [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  on the trip. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  Even though the group is an ostensibly small, non-government organization, the trips are [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  funded by the Zionist mega-donor group, the Adelson Family Foundation, and the director [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=260.24s)]
*  of the group itself is an American-born woman named Sarah Granoff who formerly served as [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=265.2s)]
*  an IDF spokeswoman and speechwriter for Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Dannen. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=270.12s)]
*  There are several other nearly identical organizations like Vibe Israel, BZ Media, Shoraka, which [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=275.4s)]
*  focuses specifically on bringing delegations from Arab and Muslim countries, Israeli Cool, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=282.48s)]
*  which tries to highlight the stories of converted anti-Semites, Hezbollah Fellowships, which [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=288.12s)]
*  targets students, and so on. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=293.16s)]
*  Jewish or Zionist organizations like the Jewish National Fund, Stand With Us, and the American [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=296.16s)]
*  Jewish Committee have also started their own influencer programs. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=300.46000000000004s)]
*  The Israeli government is also just hiring PR firms that do influencer-based marketing [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  to do marketing for Israel. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  Here's a Spanish firm with no ostensible pro-Israel bias that was hired by the Israeli [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=310.48s)]
*  Ministry of Tourism to bring two gay influencers to Tel Aviv to quote, present Israel as a [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=315.0s)]
*  gay-friendly destination, focusing on the Tel Aviv Gay Pride Parade, one of the world's [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=320.48s)]
*  most important gay-themed festivals. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=325.48s)]
*  Here's another PR firm that pays influencers to post pre-written messages with Israeli [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=327.68s)]
*  talking points. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=333.16s)]
*  One of the biggest targets for Israel is Christian Evangelicals. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=334.16s)]
*  Influencer trips for Evangelical influencers have skyrocketed and have been organized [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=338.92s)]
*  by groups like the Maccabee Task Force. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=342.88s)]
*  Israel sees Evangelicals not only as an important demographic for showing up support in America, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=345.44s)]
*  but also for giving the illusion that Israel's land theft has some kind of biblical history [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=350.06s)]
*  An article in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, written about some of the groups involved [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=355.28s)]
*  in these Christian influencer trips, featured quotes from American pastors saying that Jewish [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=359.2s)]
*  people were chosen by God and that Palestine was promised to them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=363.88s)]
*  Groups like Israel 365 Media do this on the domestic front, paying Christian influencers [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=368.88s)]
*  to tell their audiences that Christians have a biblical mandate to support Israel. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=374.06s)]
*  They work with media outlets like TBN, the world's largest Christian TV network, and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=378.41999999999996s)]
*  Prager University, a major conservative online media outlet followed by many Christian Americans. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=382.84s)]
*  One thing worth noting in regards to the scope of this effort is that all students that go [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  through the Israeli school system are required to take a course on Hezbollah in combating [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  criticism of Israel online. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  The Israeli Foreign Ministry is also training influencers to defend Israel online. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=400.64s)]
*  These influencers, who collectively have tens of millions of followers, are invited to special [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  training camps where they're coached on how to rebut pro-Palestine talking points [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=409.52s)]
*  and get a direct line of contact to the Israeli government on a constant and emergency basis. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=413.79999999999995s)]
*  But the most egregious part of Israel's online strategy is its use of fake bot accounts that [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  spam pro-Israel comments and posts online. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=425.08s)]
*  An investigation by the Al Jazeera Media Institute revealed hundreds of accounts created shortly [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=428.44s)]
*  after October 7th with around 50 to 100 followers pretending to be Arabs and constantly posting [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=433.47999999999996s)]
*  comments criticizing the Palestinians, regional resistance groups, and Iran. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=439.5s)]
*  These accounts would mainly target pages that were popular in the Arab and Muslim world [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=444.82s)]
*  like Al Jazeera and TRT. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=448.3s)]
*  Their comments would mainly blame the Palestinians for the destruction they're facing and portray [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=451.02s)]
*  them as beggars who were ungrateful for the aid they were getting from other Arab countries. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=455.26s)]
*  These accounts would also start dialogues with each other where one fake account would post [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=460.94s)]
*  a comment and another fake account would respond, which indicates that they aren't [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=465.06s)]
*  individual accounts but that they're part of an organized effort. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=469.3s)]
*  No one took responsibility for this, but Israel has admitted to using bot farms in the past. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=472.82s)]
*  During Israel's massacre against Gaza in 2021, the Israeli army used bots to promote [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=478.34000000000003s)]
*  a hashtag, Gaza Regrets, to try to rally support for Israel's war. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=483.14s)]
*  And while the military admitted it was using fake accounts and even apologized for it, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=488.26s)]
*  the Israeli government continues to employ people to defend Israel online and pledge [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=492.66s)]
*  to target teenagers in its next online campaign. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=496.82s)]
*  While this video doesn't cover the full extent of Israel's manipulation online, much of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=501.02000000000004s)]
*  which we have to assume has yet to be uncovered, we hope that this helps you know what signs [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=505.42s)]
*  to look for. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=509.74s)]
*  The Trump administration and the Israel lobby have launched a concerted effort, outlined [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=511.1s)]
*  in the Heritage Foundation's Project Esther proposal, to smear the Palestine movement [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=515.0600000000001s)]
*  as an inorganic movement that's being propped up by foreign actors. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=519.3s)]
*  But it's actually Israel that's carrying out the real foreign influence campaign to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=523.4599999999999s)]
*  try to run cover for its genocide. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=527.3399999999999s)]
*  This year, Israel has increased its propaganda budget twenty-fold to a whopping $150 million. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=529.6999999999999s)]
*  That money's all going somewhere, meaning we're likely going to see more pro-Israel [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=536.9799999999999s)]
*  bot comments and more covertly paid influencer messaging coming from the pro-Israel side. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=540.5799999999999s)]
*  Israel's trying to confuse online audiences by flooding their timelines with paid propaganda, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=546.26s)]
*  but that's unlikely to change much. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=551.78s)]
*  Israel's genocide in Gaza has led to an unprecedented decline in public opinion towards [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=553.86s)]
*  the country, and some polls show that it's now the most hated country in the world. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=558.4200000000001s)]
*  Spamming people with canned talking points and sponsored content isn't going to change that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8JUcEWmwVI&t=563.02s)]
