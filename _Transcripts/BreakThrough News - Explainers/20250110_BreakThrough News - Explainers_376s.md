# The LA Fires Are Exposing the Predatory Nature of For-Profit Insurance
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4)
*  The LA Fire should be a wake-up call about the predatory nature of the insurance industry. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=0.0s)]
*  As of the time of this recording, the LA fires have damaged thousands of structures and over [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  2,000 homes have been completely destroyed in what's already been called one of the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=10.28s)]
*  worst disasters in the history of California and also one of the costliest disasters in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=14.56s)]
*  US history. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  In places like California where wildfires are common, most people buy fire insurance [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=20.32s)]
*  for their houses so in the event their house burns down, the insurance company will pay [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=24.72s)]
*  for the damages. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=28.98s)]
*  At least that's how it's supposed to work. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=30.34s)]
*  But people are justifiably extremely worried about whether the insurance companies will [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=32.74s)]
*  cover any of the damage at all. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=37.3s)]
*  In the last few years, several insurance companies cancelled a total of 2.8 million customers' [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=39.46s)]
*  insurance policies across the state, including 531,000 policies in Los Angeles County saying [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=46.14s)]
*  they just didn't want to deal with the risk of it anymore. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  This choice has left what probably amounts to hundreds of thousands of people in LA County [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=55.18s)]
*  having no fire insurance right now because their insurance company cancelled their plan. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=59.82s)]
*  If any of these people lose their homes in these fires, they will essentially lose everything. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=64.78s)]
*  Some people who had their plans cancelled were able to switch to the state government's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=70.82s)]
*  fire insurance plan called the Fair Plan, but the Fair Plan receives no taxpayer support [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=74.22s)]
*  whatsoever, making the plan extremely expensive for what amounts to barebones coverage. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=78.98s)]
*  While the state is assuring people that all the damage will be covered, customers will [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=84.66s)]
*  almost certainly foot the bill in the form of higher premiums. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=88.46s)]
*  Now the media is talking about the insurance crisis like it's a matter of bad policy [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=92.38s)]
*  or bad management, but the real problem is, insurance under capitalism is inherently predatory, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=96.16s)]
*  corrupt and directly incentivizes this exact type of behavior that we're seeing right [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=108.34s)]
*  Let me show you how. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=109.5s)]
*  How do insurance companies work? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=110.92s)]
*  Insurance companies make money by charging customers a monthly fee in exchange for the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=113.24s)]
*  promise that in the event of some unlikely and expensive misfortune, the company will [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=117.94s)]
*  cover the cost. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=122.61999999999999s)]
*  Now in a fair and logical system, the company should have to own that loss. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=123.8s)]
*  But we don't live in a system that's fair or logical. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=128.76s)]
*  We live in a system based on maximizing profit. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=131.68s)]
*  And in a system where the goal is to maximize profit, insurance companies would rather cheat [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  their customers than honor the payments they promised them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=138.6s)]
*  So how do insurance companies cheat? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=142.2s)]
*  Well first, they can argue that the disaster incident was never actually covered by the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=144.54s)]
*  customer's policy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=148.56s)]
*  One of the biggest things insurance companies invest in is an army of lawyers who write [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=150.61999999999998s)]
*  ridiculously complicated policies that are intentionally written to be confusing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=154.88s)]
*  The lawyers will layer hidden clauses in between pages and pages of dense legal language that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  say we don't have to cover you if this happens, or we don't have to cover you if the damage [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  happens in that particular way. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=169.14s)]
*  The company of course knows that very few people will read their policies, let alone [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=171.46s)]
*  understand them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  And when the day finally comes when the customer actually goes through that once in a lifetime [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=176.9s)]
*  emergency and they go to the company thinking the damage is covered, the company turns around [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  and tells them, oh, actually, you're not covered for this at all. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=185.10000000000002s)]
*  We don't have to pay you anything. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  Another thing insurance companies will do is massively underestimate the cost of repair [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=190.98000000000002s)]
*  or remedy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=194.62s)]
*  The way this works is that a lot of insurance policies determine how large an insurance [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=195.82s)]
*  payout will be based on the cost of repairing the damage. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=199.92s)]
*  But the cost of repairing the damage, the insurance company will say, is up for interpretation, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  and what the company will do is intentionally underestimate the cost of repair. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  So if you got hurricane insurance, and then a hurricane knocks a tree over and destroys [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  your entire living room, an insurance company might come in and say, this will only cost [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  $10,000 to fix when you know for a fact that it'll really cost $30,000. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=221.11999999999998s)]
*  Now, the practices that I've just laid out are so common, it wouldn't be any sort of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  exaggeration to say that they're baked into the business model of every insurance company. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  So why do insurance companies make a regular practice of doing things that are so blatantly [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  corrupt and immoral? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=242.42s)]
*  It's simple. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  The less money they pay out for our insurance claims, the more money they keep for themselves. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=245.16s)]
*  This is also why I say that the corruption of for-profit insurance isn't a matter of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=249.84s)]
*  opinion or particularly evil CEO or company. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=254.08s)]
*  It's an inherent feature of the industry. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=258.36s)]
*  If you don't believe me, imagine what would happen if there was a good insurance company, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=260.68s)]
*  a company that was moral and chose to pay what it actually owed its customers. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=265.68s)]
*  The good company would make far less profit than the companies that cheat their customers [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=270.72s)]
*  and would thus have far less profit to deliver to their investors. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=275.36s)]
*  The investors would then say, why are we investing money in this company that's not making us [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=278.72s)]
*  any profit? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=283.64000000000004s)]
*  And they'll pull their money out of the good company and reinvest it in the dishonest criminal [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  companies because those companies will have much higher profit margins than the good company. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  The good company will then run out of investment funds and go out of business. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=294.88s)]
*  In short, cheating, lying and stealing are inherent to the capitalist system because [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  dishonest behavior is profitable. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=305.04s)]
*  Insurance companies cheat their customers out of coverage because they keep more of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=308.44s)]
*  the money that way. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  Phone companies build smartphones that break down as soon as the new phone comes out so [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=313.44s)]
*  people have to constantly buy new phones. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=317.68s)]
*  Pharmaceutical companies are probably kicking the can down the road on curing major diseases [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=320.2s)]
*  because they know that once they cure a disease, they won't have patients buying their pills [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=325.36s)]
*  every month. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=329.48s)]
*  Honesty and morality are incompatible with profitable business practice, period. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=330.48s)]
*  Why do we tolerate a system where people get rich by manufacturing suffering and misery? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=335.56s)]
*  Why do we tolerate a system where people are rewarded with yachts and mansions for denying [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=341.8s)]
*  help to people on the worst days of their lives? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=348.16s)]
*  The media keeps calling this a natural disaster, but thousands of people losing their homes [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  and entire families going completely bankrupt? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=356.6s)]
*  That's man made, not to mention these insurance companies are quite literally making record [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=359.88s)]
*  profits off of our suffering and we're supposed to feel sorry for them? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  At what point are we going to decide that we can't live like this anymore? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_6tNtG4S4&t=370.8s)]
