# Israeli Extremist Groups Are Trying to Bring About the End Times
**BreakThrough News - Explainers:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo)
*  There's a movement in Israel that wants to bring about the end of the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=0.0s)]
*  It's called the Temple Movement, and it's crucial to understanding the ultra-right-wing in Israel. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=3.36s)]
*  A few weeks ago, a group of Palestine Solidarity activists were protesting Israeli National Security Minister [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Itamar Ben-Gavir's visit to Brooklyn. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  He was visiting the international headquarters of the Chabad Lubavitch Movement, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=15.76s)]
*  which is one of the largest ultra-orthodox movements in the world. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=19.52s)]
*  Most of the discussion of Ben-Gavir's visit focused on the attack against the pro-Palestine protesters, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=22.72s)]
*  but what completely flew under the radar was what Itamar was even doing there to begin with. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=27.76s)]
*  A video of Itamar's speech to the Chabad congregation showed Itamar jumping around and chanting [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=32.88s)]
*  that Israel will build a Jewish temple on top of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=38.0s)]
*  the current location of one of the holiest sites in Islam, Al Aqsa Mosque. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=42.0s)]
*  Itamar is part of a wider constellation of ultra-right pro-Israel groups called the Temple Movement [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=46.48s)]
*  that want to destroy Al Aqsa Mosque and replace it with a Jewish temple, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  which some extremists in the Jewish community believe will fulfill end-times prophecy and bring back the Messiah. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=61.92s)]
*  In practice, this is essentially a call for the total extermination of the Palestinian people [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=67.68s)]
*  because Al Aqsa is an absolute red line for them, and Muslims across the world for that matter. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=72.72s)]
*  This messianic movement, which used to be completely fringe, is now at the heart of the Israeli right-wing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=77.36s)]
*  You may have seen videos circulating recently on Israeli social media [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=83.28s)]
*  of Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock being blown up and replaced with a Jewish temple. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=86.8s)]
*  This movement is being funded by some of the most genocidal factions in Israel [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=91.6s)]
*  and has been gaining so much momentum that its proponents now occupy positions in the current government. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=95.28s)]
*  Here's what you need to know. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=100.48s)]
*  The story of the Jewish temple according to the Tanakh is that when the Jews escaped Egypt and arrived in Palestine, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=101.92s)]
*  which was known as Canaan at the time, they killed all the inhabitants of Canaan for being polytheists [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=107.84s)]
*  and built a temple to the one god they believed in in what is today Jerusalem. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=113.04s)]
*  The Babylonians destroyed the temple and the Jews rebuilt it on the same spot, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=117.36s)]
*  only for the Romans to destroy it a second time, which led to the Jews being scattered across the world. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=121.36s)]
*  According to some Jews, when Jews build a third temple on the same spot, the Messiah will return. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=126.32s)]
*  The only problem with this is that they also believe that the first and second temples [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=132.16s)]
*  were built on the temple mount where Al Aqsa is. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=135.84s)]
*  The goal of the temple movement, therefore, has been to destroy Al Aqsa. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=138.23999999999998s)]
*  The most important group in this movement is the Temple Institute, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=141.84s)]
*  and it's an organization dedicated entirely to building the third temple by hand [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=144.88s)]
*  and removing the abomination, meaning Al Aqsa in the Dome of the Rock. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=148.88s)]
*  They've spent years preparing ritual objects to be used when the third temple is built, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=152.72s)]
*  things like robes for priests, a 42 kilogram golden menorah, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=156.8s)]
*  animals for ritual sacrifices, and of course blueprints and 3D models of the temple itself. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=160.88s)]
*  They produce ads and social media videos where Jews in Israel wake up one day with a fully [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=166.56s)]
*  completed Jewish temple in Al Aqsa's place and call on the Jewish people to make the dream a reality. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=171.28s)]
*  Their YouTube channel is full of lectures interpreting Jewish scripture [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=177.2s)]
*  through the lens of this fascist ideology. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=180.96s)]
*  To give you an idea of how this group thinks, let's start by looking at their founder, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=183.36s)]
*  a rabbi named Yisrael Ariel. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=187.28s)]
*  Yisrael Ariel was a member of the Israeli Koch Party, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  which was a party that advocated the total removal of Palestinians from Palestine. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=192.88s)]
*  Part of its platform was the banning of Muslims from the temple mount, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=196.96s)]
*  and the Israeli Koch Party was so racist and violent that it was actually banned in Israel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=200.4s)]
*  The Koch Party's founder was a rabbi from Brooklyn named Mer Kahana, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=206.0s)]
*  the founder of a New York-based ultra-nationalist paramilitary group [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=209.68s)]
*  called the Jewish Defense League that would attack and in some cases murder anyone they [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=212.88s)]
*  considered enemies of the Jewish people, i.e. anti-Zionists and random Arabs. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=217.52s)]
*  Yasser Arafat said he was going to dance into the United Nations [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=222.4s)]
*  because JDL said they're going to use this. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=226.32s)]
*  Someday, we hope very soon, we are going to use this on him. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=230.4s)]
*  The JDL is widely believed to have been behind the bombing and murder of Arab American rights [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=235.44s)]
*  activist Alex Oda, and the JDL also plotted to assassinate a Lebanese-American member of Congress [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=240.16s)]
*  and blow up a nearby mosque. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=245.76s)]
*  The JDL is a designated terrorist organization in the United States and Canada, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=247.6s)]
*  but despite this, Kahana is not only celebrated by many Israelis, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=251.76s)]
*  his thinking has been transformed into an ideology known as Kahanism, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=256.0s)]
*  and the guy who founded the Temple Institute is a Kahanist and was an elected member of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=260.0s)]
*  Kahana's fascist party. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=264.8s)]
*  As soon as the Temple Institute's founder Yisrael Ariel left Israeli parliament, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=266.64s)]
*  he was arrested in a plot to take over the Temple Mount by force by carving a tunnel underneath it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  In 2015, Ariel led a group of Orthodox rabbis in penning a message of support [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=277.04s)]
*  for 10 Israeli men who were banned from going into the West Bank after they committed an arson [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=282.0s)]
*  attack against a Palestinian family, killing three people including 18-month-old Ali Dababshah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=286.64s)]
*  Here's a video of the men from this group taunting Ali's grandmother outside of a courthouse. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=293.04s)]
*  The Temple Institute founder Yisrael Ariel wrote as the spokesman of these rabbis [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=302.8s)]
*  that the men who burned the Dababshah family alive were [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=307.68s)]
*  quote, praiseworthy and an inspiration to rabbinical judges and to all the faithful of Israel. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  By far the most prominent member of the Institute was Rabbi Chaim Richmond. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=316.56s)]
*  He likes to say that the Temple movement isn't political, that it's just a spiritual movement, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=320.8s)]
*  but listen to him for yourself and tell me if he's someone who sounds apolitical to you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=325.44000000000005s)]
*  The secretary of the covenant says this will be the last war against Gaza. This is going to be it [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=329.68s)]
*  right now. That remains to be seen. I think that people don't really understand the mentality that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  we're dealing with. I think they don't really understand who, if you can call them people, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  who they really are. You have to understand what's going on here in Israel is going to, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=344.16s)]
*  it always, I've always said this, but now it's clearer than ever that it will determine the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=349.84s)]
*  fate of all humanity. I just want to say this to our Christian friends. You guys are worshiping [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=354.88s)]
*  one Jew. That's a mistake. You should be worshiping every single one of us because we all die for your [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=361.36s)]
*  sins every single day. And that's exactly what's going on here. We're all God's first, but we're [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=367.12s)]
*  dying for your sins right now because the Jewish people in the land of Israel are the bulwark [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=372.8s)]
*  against the orcs. The temple institute is just the main group, but there's a litany of similar [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=378.16s)]
*  groups like the temple Mount faithful, the movement for temple renewal, high, the car, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=383.36s)]
*  har har bayet shalanu center for the study of the history of the temple in Jerusalem, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  the center for temple studies at Mitzvah, women for the temple. I could go on and on. And while [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  they all share similar goals, their motivations are different. Some of these groups are religious, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=398.0s)]
*  while some are just nationalists. Some defy Israeli law while others try to work within it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=402.72s)]
*  And like I said earlier, this movement has had a resurgence in the last 10 years or so [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=407.76000000000005s)]
*  and are now taking up positions in the Israeli government. A big reason for this resurgence is [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=412.16s)]
*  that temple movement groups are being funded by the Khanis and are deeply tied with the Israeli [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=417.12s)]
*  settler movement, which is itself motivated by religious extremism in many cases. For example, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=422.0s)]
*  one of the largest groups the Khanis has been funding is Lehava, a Jewish supremacist group [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=427.76s)]
*  whose goal is to stop marriages between Jews and non-Jews. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=432.88s)]
*  The founder of this group called for the destruction of the Dome of the Rock on Jerusalem Day, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=436.4s)]
*  posting an image of the structure being bulldozed by a crane. In fact, due to how controversial [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=459.12s)]
*  these messianic ideas are, the Israeli government will often condemn these groups to the international [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=464.32s)]
*  community, but investigations have shown that they're also quietly funding these groups. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=468.88s)]
*  One investigation found that the government was not only giving money to the Temple Institute, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=473.52s)]
*  they also found that the government was allowing women to opt out of Israel's compulsory military [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=477.44s)]
*  service if they worked for the Institute. They've also been trying for years to take over the Likud [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=482.08s)]
*  Party, the party of Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=487.36s)]
*  Black inside Likud, Israel's ruling party, and we're attempting to take over the Likud Party [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=490.4s)]
*  and turn it into a color party. I'm looking straight at this camera. I am a Talmud of Rabbi Meir [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  Kahana. I was, I am, I always will be. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=507.91999999999996s)]
*  Recent and current Israeli government officials who have expressed support for an Israeli takeover [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=514.24s)]
*  of the Temple Mount include current Israeli ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hotevelli, former [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=518.16s)]
*  Minister of Agriculture Yuri Ariel, former Knesset member and Deputy Defense Minister Rabbi Eli Ben [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=523.6s)]
*  DeHaan, the current Minister of Transportation Mary Ragev, the notoriously racist former Justice [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=529.6s)]
*  Minister Ayelet Shackid, the current Deputy Prime Minister Yairav Levine, Yuli Edelstein, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=535.28s)]
*  the former Minister of Health, former Knesset members Yehuda Glick and Moshe Feiglin, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=541.04s)]
*  and current Knesset members Yitzhak Pintras and of course Itamar Ben-Gavir. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=545.68s)]
*  It was no accident that Chabad Ljubovic invited him to their headquarters. Itamar Ben-Gavir is [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=550.64s)]
*  the face of the Kahana's funded Jewish power party and the face of the Temple movement in Israeli [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=556.0s)]
*  politics. He routinely tries to provoke conflict by going up to the Temple Mount with Jewish [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=560.88s)]
*  ultra-nationalist groups hoping to spark a war. Itamar himself is probably the most famous [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=566.08s)]
*  disciple of Mayor Kahana and famously kept a framed picture of Kahana's mass shooter [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=571.12s)]
*  Baruch Goldstein who shot and killed 29 Palestinians in the Ibrahimi Mosque shooting in his office. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=576.08s)]
*  The way the Chabad Ljubovic attack was framed by politicians tried to make it out like the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=583.28s)]
*  pro-Palestine protesters were just randomly attacking a synagogue. But Chabad Ljubovic itself [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=587.68s)]
*  is part of the Third Temple movement, especially outside of Israel. Their yellow flag with the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=593.68s)]
*  crown on it has been used as a banner of the ultra-right being flown in Gaza by IDF soldiers [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=598.64s)]
*  and at ultra-right wing rallies like the rally where Israelis protested for the right of Israeli [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocCNeS8Ugo&t=604.2399999999999s)]
