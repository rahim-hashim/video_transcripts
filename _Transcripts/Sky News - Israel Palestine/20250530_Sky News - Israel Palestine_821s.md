Video Description: Israel's ambassador to the United Nations has rejected claims some Gazans are starving.
A UN spokesman said earlier that "Gaza is the hungriest place on Earth" due to Israel obstructions to aid deliveries in the Strip.
"The only starvation is Gaza is the starvation of the hostages," Danny Danon said told Sky News.
He that added Hamas and the UN "have the same goal of preventing aid coming into Gaza".

# 'UN is working with Hamas,' claims Israel's ambassador to the United Nations
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI)
*  Let's return now to Gaza and Hamas says the Israeli response to a new US proposed plan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=0.0s)]
*  for a temporary ceasefire fails to meet, and I quote, any of the just and legitimate demands [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=5.92s)]
*  of its people. It comes as the humanitarian situation worsens with aid groups, among them [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=11.6s)]
*  the UN, warning of an absolute catastrophe in the Strip. During a meeting of the UN Security Council [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=18.16s)]
*  earlier this week, Palestine's ambassador broke down as he appealed for help on behalf of his people. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=25.04s)]
*  Let's have a listen. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=31.04s)]
*  I have grandchildren. I know what they mean to their families. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=55.04s)]
*  Well, I'm joined tonight by Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the UN. I'm wondering, Mr. Danon, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=82.24s)]
*  when you heard that testimony and before that, a surgeon's testimony saying that he had no [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=90.64s)]
*  evidence of the death of his children, and you said that he was not aware of the death of his children. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=98.24s)]
*  When you heard that testimony and before that, a surgeon's testimony saying that he hadn't [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=105.44s)]
*  treated any combatants but only children, I wonder what was going through your mind and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=113.2s)]
*  how did it make you feel? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=118.4s)]
*  You know, when I listen very carefully to the testimonies, I ask myself why the Palestinians [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=120.72s)]
*  cannot even mention Hamas. You know, I have been to the Security Council hundreds of times, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=126.56s)]
*  listening very carefully to the Palestinian representative. Not even once since the war [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=131.44000000000003s)]
*  started, he mentioned Hamas. So yes, there is suffering in Gaza. No one can deny it, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=136.4s)]
*  but the blame is on the shoulder of Hamas. They were the one who started this war 600 days ago. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=142.24s)]
*  They are the one who are rejecting an offer that was presented by Ambassador Witkowf only [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=148.08s)]
*  few days ago, and we said yes, and they said no, and now they're thinking about it. But the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=154.72000000000003s)]
*  problem is Hamas, it's not Israel. The minute Hamas would release the 58 hostages, we lay down [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=160.72s)]
*  their arms, then it will be quiet and peaceful in the region again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=166.16s)]
*  I understand that's what you're saying, but so you're not willing to take any responsibility [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=170.48s)]
*  for the airstrikes, for the ground invasion, for the level of destruction and starvation in Gaza? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=174.64s)]
*  I take responsibility for the lives and well-being of the 58 Israelis being held captive. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=181.92s)]
*  This war will not end as long as we have hostages in Gaza, and no UN resolution would change that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=187.92s)]
*  No speeches, no shows would change that. The fact is that we have hostages, we are determined to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=194.16s)]
*  bring them back home, and if we want to end their suffering, it's very simple. Release the hostages [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  now, and then we can think about what comes after. But we will not finish the war. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  Interesting, I'm pleased you brought up the hostages. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  Let's focus on the hostages then. It's also the will of the hostage families that Israel stops these [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=212.24s)]
*  airstrikes. It's been reported that many of the hostages were killed either when Hamas was, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=220.4s)]
*  or the people that were keeping them hostage, be it other jihadi groups, were approached by ground [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  troops or in Israeli airstrikes. The majority of hostages that were freed were through discussions [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=231.84s)]
*  and through a ceasefire period, not during a period of fighting. Why will you not listen to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=239.2s)]
*  the hostage families? I agree with you on this topic, Samia. We prefer to release the hostages [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=245.2s)]
*  through negotiations. That's why we accepted the offer that was presented to us. It's not a perfect [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  offer, it's not something we wanted to accept, but we decided that it's the best in order to bring [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  back more hostages back to Israel. So we said yes, Hamas said no. But if we cannot release them [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=263.68s)]
*  through negotiations, then we will have no choice. We will use our military power in order to fight [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=269.52s)]
*  Hamas, eliminate Hamas, and bring them back. Even if that risks the lives of your own citizens? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=275.76s)]
*  Well, as I told you earlier, we will try always, and we will prefer the negotiations. But once we [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=282.24s)]
*  realise that there is no partner to negotiate, we cannot just leave them behind. Every day, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=287.92s)]
*  the situation is getting worse. We have testimonies about the conditions that are being held chained [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=294.56s)]
*  in the tunnels. They don't receive any food. You spoke about starvation. The only starvation in [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=301.44s)]
*  Gaza is the starvation of the hostages. So you're denying that there are hungry children, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  babies dying. These are not my accounts. You won't allow journalists into Israel, but these [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=314.32s)]
*  are the accounts of British, American doctors, Israeli human rights groups, people who are in [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=320.32s)]
*  touch. Multiple times I've interviewed people on the ground working there. So you're denying the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=326.4s)]
*  accounts of hundreds of doctors. I listened to Mr Tom Fletcher from the UN claiming that 14,000 [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=332.4s)]
*  Palestinian babies will die within 48 hours. Then he had to retract his words and apologise, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=340.8s)]
*  and acknowledge that it was not true. Aid is coming into Gaza today through two mechanisms, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  through trucks, and through the USNU initiative, which distributed two million meals in the last [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=352.32s)]
*  few days. But you're not concerned at all, are you, that babies are dying? Are you concerned at all by [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  the images you see on Sky News screens, on multiple screens of babies starving, babies dying, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=365.6s)]
*  children escaping fires from Israeli airstrikes? As I told you earlier, I don't accept your claim [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=373.20000000000005s)]
*  that there is starvation in Gaza. I told you the only starvation is the hostages. We saw the way [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  they came out. By the way, when you look at the pictures on Sky News, you don't see people starving. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=385.04s)]
*  But when I look at the hostages coming out from the tunnels, I see their faces emaciated. I met [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=390.24s)]
*  one of the hostages who lost 30 kilos while he was held in a tunnel. So now aid is coming into Gaza. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  By your assumption that the Israeli hostages are starving, then so too. That means other people [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=408.16s)]
*  are starving. The UN says people in Gaza are at the risk of imminent famine. Only 600 of the 900 [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=414.4s)]
*  trucks that were supposed to go in have gone in so far. We've seen the fallout of the kind of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=422.24s)]
*  humanitarian aid that was supposed to give. I tell you what, let's listen to what Osh is about. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=429.6s)]
*  Allow me to answer your claim before you show me something else. Allow me to answer your claim. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=434.64s)]
*  The UN is playing a game here. The UN is not cooperating with the UN. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=439.52s)]
*  So you're saying you don't trust the UN? No, absolutely not. Look what happened in the last [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=444.88s)]
*  two days. The US opened two logistic centers. They distributed two million meals and the UN [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  decided to boycott these efforts. Moreover, there were a few NGOs who decided to work with the UN. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=455.2s)]
*  You won't allow unrooted distributors. The UN threatened those NGOs that they would take [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=461.28s)]
*  them out of the database of the UN if they would continue to cooperate. So I ask myself, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=466.4s)]
*  do the people at the UN really care about the UN? Mr. Danon, bear with me. I want to bring you a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  clip from the spokesperson of OCHE, Jens Lerker. Let's listen to that together and then we'll talk [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  again. Thank you. Gaza is the hungriest place on earth and the aid operation that we have ready to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=484.32s)]
*  roll is being put in an operational straitjacket that makes it one of the most obstructed aid [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=492.08s)]
*  operations not only in the world today but in recent history. Gaza is the hungriest place on [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=499.12s)]
*  earth, Danny Danon. I would advise you to call this official to your show, Samia, and ask him [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=506.8s)]
*  why the UN decided to boycott the new initiative of the US. Well they're saying that you have [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=513.28s)]
*  placed an operational straitjacket. Why are they actually boycotting these efforts and moreover [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=519.12s)]
*  they are threatening the Palestinians not to cooperate. So the UN is actually working with [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=525.12s)]
*  Hamas and they have the same goal to prevent aid from coming into Gaza. So the whole UN structure, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=529.6s)]
*  multiple nations that are represented by the UN including your own, they are all against Israel [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=539.36s)]
*  is what you're saying. No, I'm saying very clearly that the organization in Gaza, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=545.68s)]
*  specifically Ocha and Mr Tom Flesher, they prefer to spread lies against Israel rather than promote [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=549.68s)]
*  humanitarian aid into Gaza. If they really care about the people in Gaza, they should cooperate [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=557.52s)]
*  with the US immediately. And by the way, next week two more centers will be open in Gaza. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=562.9599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  UN NGOs to cooperate with this effort, not to boycott it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=569.92s)]
*  And what about the 200,000 people that have been forced to move yet again, probably the fifth, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=575.12s)]
*  sixth time that they've been asked to move by Israel, 200,000 people displaced in the last two [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=584.16s)]
*  weeks? Samia, if you have an idea for us, how can we bring the hostages, I'm open to listen to that. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=590.4s)]
*  But I know that there are only two ways. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=598.0s)]
*  I'm not a negotiator. I don't represent Israel. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=599.68s)]
*  I've been told there are two ways. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=602.08s)]
*  How do you think his best? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=603.52s)]
*  Do you really believe Israeli airstrikes, the displacement of 200,000 people, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=606.32s)]
*  the starvation that you deny of people, the Palestinian people is going to bring your [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=611.76s)]
*  hostages home because the hostage families don't believe that. They have repeatedly, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=617.52s)]
*  they have practically begged prime minister Netanyahu and your colleagues in the government [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=623.2800000000001s)]
*  in the Knesset to stop the bombings if only not for the safety of the Palestinians, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=628.24s)]
*  for the sake of the Israeli hostages. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=634.24s)]
*  So I meet the families of the hostages almost every week. You have different opinions. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=636.72s)]
*  The government is determined to bring them back home. We prefer negotiations, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=641.9200000000001s)]
*  but we are determined if it doesn't work through negotiations, yes, we will use our military power [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=646.48s)]
*  to bring them back home. We cannot, you know, our Jewish morality will not allow us to leave [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=651.84s)]
*  them behind. And the sooner the world will understand it, the faster this war will end. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=656.96s)]
*  Putting pressure on Israel will not help this time. The pressure should be on Hamas [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=661.76s)]
*  to accept the ceasefire. There is an offer on the table. So I would advise you and others who are [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  trying to push Israel to ask Hamas officials why they reject the offer which is on the table right [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=671.76s)]
*  now. Which will allow us to fire for the next few months. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=678.0s)]
*  Israel intends to occupy Gaza, which a number of your colleagues and counterparts in the Knesset [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=682.48s)]
*  have actually spoken out. So you, Mr Danon, you deny starvation in Gaza. You haven't addressed the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=688.0s)]
*  200,000 people displaced. You don't seem to be concerned by Israeli airstrikes which have killed [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=695.28s)]
*  more than 54,000 people. Right now a conservative figure, more than 3,000 children [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=702.32s)]
*  killed. And you say that you want your hostages back. What next? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=709.7600000000001s)]
*  Sandra, you keep repeating the numbers and those lies. And you can do it 50 times, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=714.96s)]
*  it will not be the truth. Those numbers are not correct. It's coming from the Hamas. We don't [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=719.84s)]
*  accept it. I agree with you that there is suffering in Gaza, but I'm reminding you that the blame is [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=726.08s)]
*  on Hamas. But the suffering is acceptable. It can end tomorrow morning. So if you people really care [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=731.28s)]
*  about Gaza, they should realize that Hamas should not be part of the equation. Well I think journalists [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=738.24s)]
*  care about everyone involved, including the hostages and the Palestinian people. The suffering [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=743.52s)]
*  though continues doesn't it Danny Danon? And that's the concern for everyone, hostage families and the [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=748.8s)]
*  Palestinian people. Finally, what about the fact that Martin Griffiths says that he believes this [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=754.72s)]
*  is a genocide? That's what he's told Sky News. Well you know that's a blood libel. I have no [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=760.4s)]
*  word for that. You know when you look at the definition of a genocide, you realize that you [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=766.8s)]
*  need the intention of killing. No one can blame us for intention. You know and you look at what [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=771.1999999999999s)]
*  happened, you know more than a year and a half. We have the military power to finish this war [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=776.24s)]
*  within a week or a month. We didn't do it because we apply our force and we take into consideration [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=780.72s)]
*  the population in Gaza. That is why it's so sophisticated, why it is so challenging. That's [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=787.76s)]
*  why it's taking us so long to finish this war. But we will continue to fight Hamas and to do our best [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=793.36s)]
*  to minimize civilian casualties. But as I told you earlier, we can end it tomorrow morning. There is [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=799.6s)]
*  a proposal on the table. The government of Israel adopted, accepted the proposal. Hamas rejected it [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=805.36s)]
*  again. Okay Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations. Thanks very much indeed for [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=811.36s)]
*  joining us live from New York. Thank you Samia. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fkA8B7TGI&t=817.2s)]
