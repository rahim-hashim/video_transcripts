Video Description: Benjamin Netanyahu's political future is dependent on rightwing political groups who are opposed to talks - and peace - with Hamas.
That means he does not have an incentive to agree on details before the Knesset goes into recess on 27 July, says Sky's military analyst Prof Michael Clarke.

# Why Benjamin Netanyahu does not want peace in Gaza | Prof Michael Clarke analysis
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo)
*  to Gaza now and the UN Human Rights Office says that 798 people have been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=0.0s)]
*  killed while trying to access aid in the Strip since the end of May. They say [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=6.28s)]
*  that most of those killed were in the vicinity of humanitarian foundation [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=11.08s)]
*  sites. Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has returned from his [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=15.4s)]
*  visit to the United States and despite talks there the two sides have been [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  unable to broker a ceasefire deal for the region. Well I'm joined in the studio [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=25.44s)]
*  now by our security and defense analyst Professor Michael Clarke. Hello Michael. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=30.48s)]
*  There's a political dimension to this, a domestic political dimension to this [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=35.56s)]
*  for Netanyahu in perhaps incentivizing him to try and delay any ceasefire [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=40.8s)]
*  agreement. Just talk us through that. Yeah I mean the Knesset sits, the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=47.72s)]
*  legislative body in Israel, it sits at the moment until the 27th of July and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=51.76s)]
*  then it's in recess for three months. So until the 27th of July he could be [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=56.96s)]
*  outvoted in the Knesset if the ultra right wingers, the sort of nationalist [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  Zionists in his cabinet, withdraw their support as they have threatened to do if [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=65.24s)]
*  he makes a peace deal with Hamas. So if he gets to the 27th of July then it takes [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  the pressure off him a little bit until the middle of October, maybe the end of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=74.88s)]
*  October when the Knesset reassembles. So in a sense the details that they're [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=77.92s)]
*  talking about, he doesn't have an incentive to settle on anything quickly [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=83.08s)]
*  and the details are still the details. So they're still talking about well how [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=86.68s)]
*  many hostages will be released, about 20 are thought still to be alive out of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=90.68s)]
*  about 50 unaccounted for, how, what would happen to aid distribution [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=94.36s)]
*  arrangements in Gaza which have clearly gone terribly wrong, how many Israeli [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=99.88s)]
*  troops would remain in Gaza and where would they be along the Philadelphia [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=104.76s)]
*  corridor in the south and along the Morag corridor just north of Khan [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  Eunice, where would they be? And then not least what about these talks, there have [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  to be meaningful talks on a peace settlement, a permanent peace and that's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  what Netanyahu can't go along with because talking about a permanent [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=120.12s)]
*  settlement with Hamas is not destroying Hamas as a result of the 7th of October [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=124.0s)]
*  atrocities two years ago and if he looks as if he's even prepared to talk [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  meaningfully to Hamas then he loses the right wingers in his cabinet and his [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=133.0s)]
*  government will fall. Right, okay so he's trying to sort of kick that further [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=136.68s)]
*  down the line. Meanwhile you were mentioning there about these aid [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=141.6s)]
*  distribution sites, a lot of very grave concerns being raised about safety of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=147.6s)]
*  people trying, desperately trying to get aid there. The UN's put out some [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=152.84s)]
*  figures today which sort of quantify really the number of people losing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=157.4s)]
*  their lives. Yeah almost 800 dead, the vast majority of which have lost their [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=163.6s)]
*  lives around these three sites in the south that have been put out. The [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=168.32s)]
*  Gaza Aid Foundation has got four sites, one in the north, three in the south [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=172.76s)]
*  where they're trying to draw people into the south for political reasons and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=176.6s)]
*  about more than 650 people seem to have been killed around those sites and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=180.76s)]
*  other people have been killed towards other sites. I mean who's doing the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  killing is still an issue. The idea for certainly shot some people, they admit [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  that and they're investigating it. Hamas appear to have shot some people, the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=193.44s)]
*  gangs are shooting people because Gaza is falling into a gang culture now. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  There are big families like the Abu Shabaab family in the south, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=201.12s)]
*  they've controlled the south for a long time, they're at war with Hamas, the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  Israelis look as if they're supporting. Yasser Abu Shabaab who's a sort of gang [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=208.84s)]
*  leader in the south, big family, big mafia boss in a sense, so the thing has [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=213.44s)]
*  become chaotic and of course people are getting shot trying to get the aid. The [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=218.32s)]
*  good news on this is that the Israelis are softening on their opposition to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=222.4s)]
*  UNRWA, the United Nations organisation. UNRWA runs 400 aid outlets normally and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=226.08s)]
*  in the last couple of days fuel has gone into Gaza through UNRWA thanks to EU [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=232.24s)]
*  pressure. So the European Union has been pressuring Israel, Israel are giving [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=237.68s)]
*  into that pressure to a degree and they're almost re-establishing some of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=240.96s)]
*  the UNRWA operation. So it looks as if this strong support for the Gaza [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=246.44s)]
*  humanitarian foundation, it's a very controversial arrangement, looks as if [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  that is waning and the Israelis are being pushed back towards going back to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=255.52s)]
*  UNRWA which they hate doing because they hate UNRWA, there's terrible relations [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=259.76s)]
*  between them but they are the only sensible, the only practical alternative [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=263.0s)]
*  if aid is to be restored at anything like the previous levels to the people [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  of Gaza. Okay Michael thank you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNNQQTkfoZo&t=270.88s)]
