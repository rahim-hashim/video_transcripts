Video Description: Neither the UK nor the US were involved in the Israeli operation targeting Iran, a government minister has said.
Industry Minister Sarah Jones said it would not "be appropriate" to say if the UK was informed of the attack by Israel before it happened.
She repeated the message of the prime minister and the foreign secretary, calling for "restraint and for de-escalation in the region".

# UK was not involved in Israeli strikes on Iran, says minister
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk)
*  Well, we can get a reaction from the government now, because here with me is industry minister [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=0.0s)]
*  Sarah Jones. Very good morning to you, thanks so much for coming in. What is your reaction [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=5.44s)]
*  to Israel launching strikes on Iran? Well, of course, this is an emerging situation, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=9.68s)]
*  and we want to see de-escalation. This is a dangerous moment, as the Foreign Secretary [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=16.92s)]
*  has said this morning, and we will be doing all we can, as you would expect, to work with [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=23.6s)]
*  our allies to urge for restraint and for de-escalation in the region. Did the British government [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=30.12s)]
*  have prior knowledge of the strikes? We weren't involved in the strikes. Obviously, I can't [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  talk about information about what we did or didn't know. That wouldn't be appropriate. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=43.88s)]
*  But the priority now, I know for the Foreign Secretary who will be leading on this, working [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=49.24s)]
*  closely of course with the Prime Minister, is to work with our allies to urge restraint [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=53.72s)]
*  and to de-escalate. Israel has said that it had no choice but to attack. They say they [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=59.74s)]
*  had gathered intelligence that Tehran was approaching what they call the point of no [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=65.72s)]
*  return in its pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Do you agree that they had no choice? Well, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=69.04s)]
*  I don't think anybody questions how destabilising Iran is being, of course. But what we would [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=75.24s)]
*  say is that this is escalating, not de-escalating the situation, and we would urge restraint, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=82.08s)]
*  and that's what our Foreign Secretary, our Prime Minister, will be working to do. So [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  was Israel wrong to launch these strikes? I don't think... I would say as a Foreign Office, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  not a Foreign Office Minister, things that perhaps the Foreign Secretary may or may not [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=102.68s)]
*  say in due course. What I would say from the government's perspective this morning in an [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  emerging situation is we are doing everything we can to urge restraint and to try and de-escalate [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  the situation, and I think that is the right approach. We need to be calm at this point, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  work with our allies, do what we can to stop escalation, because we do not believe escalation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=123.64000000000001s)]
*  is going to be helpful in the region or the wider world, of course. How great a risk do [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=129.28s)]
*  you consider Iran's nuclear programme to be? Well, of course, we know, and we've all known [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=135.12s)]
*  for some time, how destabilising Iran has been in their actions. I think in this moment [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  now, which is a dangerous moment, we just have to focus on de-escalation, and that's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=148.4s)]
*  what the government will be doing. And the US would be due to hold the next round of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=154.24s)]
*  negotiations with Iran on attempts to find a nuclear deal just this weekend on Sunday. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=158.72s)]
*  Do you expect those talks to go ahead? I'm sure the Foreign Secretary will say more on [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=166.6s)]
*  these matters in due course. For now, the priority for us is to try and do what we can [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=171.44s)]
*  to de-escalate, and of course there will be allies around the world who will be helping [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=177.48s)]
*  us do that. And what about British workers, British citizens in the region? Is there any [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=181.0s)]
*  move to pull embassy workers, for example, out of the region? What steps are you taking [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=187.44s)]
*  there? Well, the Foreign Secretary will be making those kinds of decisions as we speak. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=193.24s)]
*  Of course, he's been dealing with, of course, the absolutely horrific crash in India as [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=197.96s)]
*  well, the Foreign Office in crisis mode trying to support families there. He will now be [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=203.2s)]
*  looking at this emerging situation and making sure we keep people safe wherever we need [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=209.28s)]
*  to. Of course, that would be a priority for him and the government. And Iran's supreme [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=214.04s)]
*  leader has said that Israel must await severe punishment. You talk about the need for de-escalation. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=218.12s)]
*  So what would your message to Iran be as it considers its response? Well, we want all [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=224.04s)]
*  parties to de-escalate, not escalate. The language that's being used there, you can [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=229.76s)]
*  see how dangerous a moment this is and this government will be doing what it can. And [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=235.64s)]
*  give us an idea of what that involves. When you say the government will do what it can [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=240.2s)]
*  to de-escalate, what room is there for diplomacy and what role might the UK play in that? Well, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=243.27999999999997s)]
*  the UK has many allies around the world who will be wanting to do the same to get that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  restraint, to get that de-escalation, how that operates, how that works. The Foreign [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=254.44s)]
*  Secretary will say more in due course. I want to also just get your response to the devastating [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  plane crash that occurred in India yesterday, which had such awful consequences. What is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=264.56s)]
*  the latest you're hearing from India about the crash? So the Prime Minister's offered [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=272.2s)]
*  his condolences to Prime Minister Modi. It's obviously an utterly devastating situation. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=276.44s)]
*  Many families will be absolutely devastated. I'm an MP in Croydon. We have a large Indian [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=283.6s)]
*  community there and I know that people are completely distraught. We have sent some air [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=290.28s)]
*  investigators to India to help with the investigation into what happened. The Foreign Office has [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=296.24s)]
*  of course a support line that people should ring. We will be there to offer all the support [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=303.32s)]
*  that we can to those families. We need to get to the bottom of what's happened. I don't [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  think anyone is suggesting foul play, but it will take time to establish what went [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=314.08s)]
*  wrong. But of course so many people have lost loved ones and our thoughts are with them [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=319.4s)]
*  today. Absolutely. You mentioned those four British investigators on their way out to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=324.24s)]
*  help authorities there. Give us an idea of the support that might be offered to India [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=328.12s)]
*  at this time. Well, we'll offer whatever support we need. Of course our immediate concern will [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=332.96s)]
*  be the families of loved ones from the UK and how we support them, how we make sure [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=338.76s)]
*  they get all the support that they need. Of course there will be a significant investigation [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=344.0s)]
*  into what happened, which will take some time I suspect to get to the bottom of and we'll [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=349.12s)]
*  be there to support with people on the ground and people here in the UK too. Well, Sarah [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=354.84s)]
*  Jones, another time we will talk about domestic policy, but as you understand international [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=360.12s)]
*  events have rather overtaken us this morning. Thanks very much indeed for coming in and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=364.36s)]
*  thank you for your response. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-W64ZQEtfk&t=368.0s)]
