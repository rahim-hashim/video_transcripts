Video Description: Our team in Gaza filmed with baby Aya at the Rantisi hospital in northern Gaza.

She is now 3 months old and dangerously thin. Her skin stretches over her cheekbones and eye sockets on her gaunt, pale face. Her nappy is too big is for her emaciated little body.

Nineteen of Gazaâ€™s hospitals remain operational, all of them are overwhelmed with the number of patients and a lack of supplies.

# Babies in Gaza are skin and bone after eleven-week blockade
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0)
*  This is what Aya looked like shortly after she was born. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=0.0s)]
*  She is now three months old and dangerously thin. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=4.0s)]
*  Her skin stretches over her cheekbones and eye sockets, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=12.0s)]
*  across her gaunt, pale face. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=15.0s)]
*  Her nappy is too big for her emaciated little body. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=19.0s)]
*  My daughter was born at a normal weight, 3.5 kilograms, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=24.0s)]
*  but as the war went on she kept losing weight. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=29.0s)]
*  My breast milk wasn't good enough, it gave her diarrhea. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=35.0s)]
*  Formula, same thing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=39.0s)]
*  Her condition is serious, I don't want to lose her, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=44.0s)]
*  because I lost my husband and she's all I have left of him. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=47.0s)]
*  I don't want to lose her, I just really want her to get treated, that's it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=50.0s)]
*  The Kamalatwan Hospital in northern Gaza is barely standing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=59.0s)]
*  Inside the wards are covered in the debris of airstrikes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=64.0s)]
*  It was one of the largest hospitals in northern Gaza, it is now in ruins. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=68.0s)]
*  The streets and buildings nearby have been totally obliterated. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=74.0s)]
*  The Israeli offensive, increasing in its intensity every day, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=80.0s)]
*  has forced four major hospitals in Gaza to stop work over the past week, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=84.0s)]
*  worsening an already desperate medical crisis. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=89.0s)]
*  The Rantisi Hospital was a small clinic specializing in children's care, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=97.0s)]
*  but now has to take patients from right across Gaza. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=102.0s)]
*  They are overwhelmed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=105.0s)]
*  There are 300 to 500 cases a day that are in need of treatment. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=110.0s)]
*  The number of patients is about 10%. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=117.0s)]
*  This is a large number of hospitals in the Rantisi. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=120.0s)]
*  The blockade has also created a massive shortage in baby formula. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=125.0s)]
*  New mothers are struggling to breastfeed, unable to produce milk [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=129.0s)]
*  through a lack of food themselves, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=133.0s)]
*  and then their babies don't get the vital nutrients they need. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=135.0s)]
*  This is a lethal spiral. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG3ploiikV0&t=139.0s)]
