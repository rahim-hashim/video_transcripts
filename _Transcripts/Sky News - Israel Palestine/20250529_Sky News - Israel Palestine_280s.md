Video Description: Sky News has spent several days filming with emergency crews based at Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical complex and one that has itself come under repeated attack.
Medics and ambulance drivers told us their stories, about what they had seen, experienced and how it had affected them and their colleagues.
And they are also victims of the conflict, often operating while at risk of being targeted by the Israeli military, they say.

# Gaza's paramedics fear finding their own families lying in the rubble
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4)
*  The Israeli military hit a market place in Gaza city today as people were queuing to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=0.0s)]
*  buy flour. This was the scene moments after. There was nothing the medics could do for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  the victims when they arrived. Bodies were heaved onto stretchers, their mutilated arms [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=22.32s)]
*  and legs twisted. Body parts are picked from the debris and wrapped into a sheet. Just [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=30.6s)]
*  another day in Gaza. The Gaza paramedics are on the front line of this war every single day. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=48.48s)]
*  The relentless Israeli bombardment puts their lives in danger as they rush to the scene of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=60.22s)]
*  airstrikes to help retrieve the dead and wounded. Our team has filmed with the ambulance crews in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=66.84s)]
*  Gaza city over a number of days this week. It is Tuesday afternoon and an Israeli strike has hit [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=74.4s)]
*  a building in the city. The fire is burning but everyone has managed to escape. Four people have [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  been wounded. No one was killed in this strike. These paramedics are based at Schiffer hospital [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=96.44s)]
*  in Gaza city. Even back at their base they aren't safe and can't properly relax. The hospital has [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=106.84s)]
*  come under attack many times. Also there simply aren't that many of them, certainly not enough. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=114.44s)]
*  And now to make it worse, fuel for the ambulances is running low because of the blockade. The war [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=121.12s)]
*  is nearing its 20th month. They've been on call for more than 600 days now. The endless rescue [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  missions and high number of civilian casualties take their toll. The scenes we witnessed, children, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=135.08s)]
*  severed limbs, the wounded, what affects us the most is the children. Sometimes after responding [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  to an incident you begin to imagine the injured children as your own relatives. These images get [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=149.8s)]
*  mixed in your mind. The roads often become blocked by the fighting as every day new areas are [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  designated Israeli military combat zones. The paramedics need to adapt their journeys. Getting [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  it wrong could be a lethal mistake. Paramedics and rescue workers have been killed during the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=171.12s)]
*  war. Ala al-Hadidi was hit in a drone strike. He was buried by his colleagues. Every one of them [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=179.64s)]
*  knows it could have been them. Safety, no there is no safety. Right now there is no safety. When we [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  respond to an airstrike the drones are overhead. In the first round of airstrikes they targeted my [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=206.16s)]
*  colleague in one of our vehicles. It is around 1am on Wednesday morning. A three-storey building [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=212.12s)]
*  has been hit with 20 people inside. There is chaos as the team arrive on the scene. The body [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  of a young girl in her pyjamas is immediately handed to them. She is dead. Standing on the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=232.0s)]
*  ruins of the apartment block they pull another body covered in dust from under a massive slab [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=242.2s)]
*  of concrete. Another one dead. This time a young man. In a few hours it will be dawn, a new day. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=247.96s)]
*  The paramedics will have to be ready to go again. Alistair Bunkle, Sky News in Jerusalem. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-JSXawRf4&t=258.34s)]
