# Gaza: Inside Nasser Hospital after reported Israeli attack
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw)
*  in an Israeli attack near an aid distribution centre in the Strip. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=0.0s)]
*  Eyewitnesses said Israeli forces opened fire on crowds [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=2.84s)]
*  at a roundabout near a humanitarian foundation hub in Rafa. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  The reports emerged as a hospital run by the Red Cross said [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=11.16s)]
*  at least 175 people were wounded in the incident. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Well, casualties have also been sent to other hospitals [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=18.68s)]
*  in the surrounding area, and Dr Victoria Rose is working [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=21.36s)]
*  at the Nasser Hospital in Karnounis, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=25.2s)]
*  and sent us this update earlier. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  So, I'm still here at the Nasser complex. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  There's been a shooting at the GHF aid distribution complex in Rafa. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=33.92s)]
*  I'm in the emergency department. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=40.08s)]
*  Apparently, there's been anything from 20 to 50 people shot dead. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  The reports are there's anything from 100 to 200 people [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=47.92s)]
*  injured by gunshot wounds. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=52.0s)]
*  We're receiving quite a few of the casualties now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=54.04s)]
*  The ambulances haven't stopped coming, but we know that a lot [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=57.08s)]
*  of the injured were taken to the local field hospitals. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=60.0s)]
*  So, places like ICRC and UK Med. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=63.64s)]
*  And we're dealing with the people that actually managed to get [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=67.72s)]
*  as far as Nasser, which, as you know, is in the red zone. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=70.16s)]
*  So, not an easy journey to make from Rafa. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, this is the live picture in southern Gaza. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  And while the incident in Rafa comes amid, of course, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=83.56s)]
*  the fact that aid is beginning to trickle in after months [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=88.28s)]
*  of a total blockade, aid groups saying that Israel's restrictions, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=92.72s)]
*  the breakdown of law and order and widespread looting [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=96.24s)]
*  has made it extremely difficult to deliver supplies. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=98.96s)]
*  And experts are warning that Gaza is at risk from famine [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=101.72s)]
*  if more aid is not brought in. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TF2XyPzXiw&t=105.75999999999999s)]
