# Palestinian journalist: 'I feel like I am so helpless'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg)
*  You're talking there in Paris about becoming almost an accidental journalist after October 7 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=0.0s)]
*  and the war that began on the people of Gaza. Just tell me about that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=7.2s)]
*  So, on the 7th of October began, I was a normal girl and I was only 20. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  So, you know that the Israeli didn't allow for any of international journalists to enter Gaza, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  especially after the war of 2021. So, when I saw that we are the civilians' people, now the only [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=33.6s)]
*  here is the only voice for our people in Gaza. I choose to become a journalist to talk about [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=46.56s)]
*  the right to talk about what's going on in Gaza because I felt like it's more than a duty. It's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=54.24s)]
*  more than responsibility for me, for my people to talk about like what's going on in Gaza because [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=60.88s)]
*  this is so important. There is no international journalist. There is no European outlets that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=68.08s)]
*  talks enough about Gaza. So, I choose to become a journalist because this is also something [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=74.64s)]
*  important and it's about a human that becoming a journalist, not because I want to, but because I [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=81.6s)]
*  had to. And tell me how difficult it was then to leave Gaza. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=90.24s)]
*  Well, leaving Gaza wasn't that easy because we left Gaza before two months. And now I am in France [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=97.36s)]
*  and I feel like, okay, I am in a new situation and the genocide is still in Gaza. And, you know, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=111.68s)]
*  I always say like this is not a survive. This is a second or another way to of death. So, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=124.56s)]
*  here I am in France with all of the stress, with all of hopeless and helpless. So, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  yeah, I feel like I am dying in a slowly way, but all I have to do now is just writing about [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  what's going on in Gaza because it's so important for me to do something also for [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=151.92s)]
*  two million people that they are suffering in Gaza and they are trying to survive. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=160.32s)]
*  And Rita, what are some of your friends and people who remain in Gaza saying about the situation now? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=169.11999999999998s)]
*  Well, talking to my people and to my friends in Gaza, it makes me feel like [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  I am dying while I am talking to them because, you know, there is no food. There is nothing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=185.44s)]
*  left in Gaza but trouble, but death. But like when I'm talking to them, I feel like [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=192.24s)]
*  I am so helpless and I need to do something for them. But, you know, the situation is getting [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=200.08s)]
*  worse and worse day by day. And it's not just about food. Like how Dr. Victoria also mentioned [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  that the hospitals and the health system in Gaza is so damaged. So, we are talking about a real [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=219.12s)]
*  genocide that is going on in Gaza. Sometimes I feel like I want to explain more and more, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=227.92s)]
*  but I don't know how to explain. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCdght3KMg&t=239.76s)]
