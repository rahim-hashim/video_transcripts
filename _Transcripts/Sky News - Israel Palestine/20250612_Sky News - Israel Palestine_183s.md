# BREAKING: Donald Trump says the US was not involved in Israeli strikes on Iran
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ)
*  Well, just to let you know that in the last few moments, the Foreign Secretary David Lammy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=0.0s)]
*  has put out a post on X. There it is. He says, stability in the Middle East is vital for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=4.24s)]
*  global security. I'm concerned to see reports of strikes overnight. Further escalation is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=10.72s)]
*  a serious threat to peace and stability in the region and is in no one's interests. This [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=16.94s)]
*  is a dangerous moment and I urge all parties to show restraint. So the Foreign Secretary [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=22.88s)]
*  there calling for restraint on the news of those Israeli strikes on Iran. Well, as we've [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=29.56s)]
*  mentioned, the US has denied any military involvement in the attacks. Our correspondent [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=36.72s)]
*  David Blevins joins me now from Los Angeles. And David, what do you make of how the US [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=42.04s)]
*  have responded to Israel's strikes on Iran? They say they were not involved in the strikes, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=47.96s)]
*  but do we know how much they knew about them? Yes, well, it's very clear that the White [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=56.36s)]
*  House is seeking to distance itself from these strikes right now. A statement from US Secretary [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=62.76s)]
*  of State Marco Rubio contained the critical word unilateral, emphasizing that this was [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  Israel's decision and Israel's alone, because the United States is very well aware of the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  posed as a result of this escalation. We do know that Israel informed Washington in advance. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=82.0s)]
*  We're told that the president's national security team monitored the strikes in real time from [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=89.12s)]
*  the Situation Room at the White House, but he himself has been adamant throughout recent [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=94.72s)]
*  weeks that there should be space left for negotiation, that there should be at least [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=101.36s)]
*  an attempt made to reach agreement with Iran. And their number one priority at the White [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=106.56s)]
*  House right now is the safety of their own personnel in that region. Just yesterday, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=111.76s)]
*  they put non-essential staff, for example, at the US Embassy in Baghdad, on standby for [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  evacuation. They've now restricted the movement of some US staff in Israel, so they are deeply [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=122.84s)]
*  concerned by what has happened overnight. OK, David, thanks very much indeed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  And let's just take a look, actually, at the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=136.56s)]
*  that he put out about the attack. He said tonight, Israel took unilateral action against [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=143.56s)]
*  Iran. We're not involved in strikes against Iran, and our top priority is protecting American [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=149.84s)]
*  forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=155.52s)]
*  its self-defense. President Trump and the administration have taken all necessary steps [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=160.76s)]
*  to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=165.6s)]
*  be clear, Iran should not target US interests or personnel. So that's what the US Secretary [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=170.28s)]
*  of State said in the aftermath of those strikes by Israel overnight. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilEAzxlpRRQ&t=176.67999999999998s)]
