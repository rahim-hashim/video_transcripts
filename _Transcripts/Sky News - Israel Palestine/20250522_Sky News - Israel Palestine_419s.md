# 'This is a horrific attack against the Jewish community'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0)
*  Ambassador, thank you so much for joining us. Your immediate reaction this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=0.0s)]
*  That was a horrific attack not only against Israel or the Jewish community, but against [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=5.0s)]
*  the value of the United States and the capital of the U.S. A few blocks from the White House, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=11.6s)]
*  you know, innocent young professionals came to meet and to learn about diplomacy, and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=16.52s)]
*  they were attacked by a terrorist. It's unfortunate, but we have to tie it to the incitement we [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=21.88s)]
*  have seen in the last few weeks against Israel. You know, the chants on campuses, Death to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=27.72s)]
*  Israel, Intifada, Call for Violence, riots. And also we saw it in diplomacy in the heart [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=33.36s)]
*  of the U.N. You know, senior U.N. officials spread lies about Israel, blaming us for committing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=41.04s)]
*  a genocide. You know, USG Tom Fletcher a few days ago said that 14,000 Palestinian babies [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=47.04s)]
*  will die within 48 hours. All those lies create the atmosphere that leads to the action [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=54.2s)]
*  we saw tonight. I expect actions from the authorities, not only declarations, but to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=59.88s)]
*  fight against anti-Semitism. Give us a snapshot, if you will, Ambassador, of I guess the scale [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=65.56s)]
*  of anti-Semitism that you think exists in America right now relative to the last few [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=73.44s)]
*  Has it been rising significantly? Absolutely. And it's not a feeling. You know, we have [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=81.24s)]
*  numbers. You have reports of the FBI, which indicates that there is a rise of anti-Semitism [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=87.16s)]
*  worldwide, you know, in the U.S., in Europe. And the main problem will be the gap between [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  the declarations and the actions. Most leaders will condemn anti-Semitism. I'm sure within [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=98.6s)]
*  a few hours when all the leaders will wake up here in the U.S., you will see condemnations [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  across the aisle. The question is, what is the next step? Whether there would be a federal [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=109.02s)]
*  program to actually take actions? You know, how many indictments against people who promoted [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=113.42s)]
*  hate crimes took place in the U.S. or Europe in the last year? So we expect actions. You [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=119.34s)]
*  know, you can't put a guard in every event, in every synagogue. You cannot put a guard [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=125.62s)]
*  against every Jewish person in the United States, but you should look after those who [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=130.74s)]
*  incite for violence, arrest them and stop them before they commit those horrible crimes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=135.9s)]
*  What do you make, therefore, though, of the response, albeit so far, I think only on social [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  media from the likes of Marco Rubio and, of course, the president? We appreciate the strong [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  words of President Trump and Secretary Rubio. Very important words. And I believe that we [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=154.3s)]
*  will see more actions. You know, we have seen some progress on campuses, you know. And by [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=159.66s)]
*  the way, it's legitimate to have a demonstration, but it's not legitimate to attack Jewish students. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=165.3s)]
*  It's not legitimate to call for death for other students. And I think we will see more [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=171.94s)]
*  actions taken by the new administration. It's hard to sort of bring up the next topic. And [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=178.02s)]
*  I don't mean to sort of mix the two topics because, you know, this morning we're obviously [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=185.26000000000002s)]
*  talking about this horrific double murder. But can you snap show you get to talk so much [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=189.32s)]
*  more with the key players? And obviously in this country, we've been talking the last [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=196.2s)]
*  couple of days about a slight change in tone in the relationship from the UK government [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=200.72s)]
*  to the Israeli government. And I wonder what you think the tone is at the moment between [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=206.4s)]
*  the US government and the Israeli government. Have President Trump and his colleagues been [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=211.18s)]
*  taking a tougher stance, do you think, of late, towards Benjamin Netanyahu? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  No, I think we have a very strong bond with the US. We talk with them. We share our concerns. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=220.48s)]
*  They support the goals of the world to bring back all the hostages and to eliminate Hamas. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=228.72s)]
*  And I agree with you that we have seen a change in the UK and France. It wasn't a slight change. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=234.16s)]
*  It was more than that. I think it was an orchestrated attack against Israel. And that's very interesting [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=238.44s)]
*  because, you know, the same day we actually decided to allow humanitarian aid to enter [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=244.16s)]
*  Gaza, we saw this diplomatic attack against Israel, those threats. But I have to be very [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=248.88s)]
*  sincere about the situation. We have no intention to stay in Gaza forever. We didn't start this [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=255.04s)]
*  war, but the war will not end with 58 hostages left behind. In order to finish this war, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  the hostages have to come back. Hamas should lay threatened, maybe exile the leadership [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=268.4s)]
*  of Hamas, and then there will be future for Gaza and stability in the region. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=274.12s)]
*  So I mean, it's interesting to hear that explicitly. Maybe it's been misreported, maybe it's been [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=280.44s)]
*  exaggerated, or perhaps you would criticise some of the rhetoric from members of the government [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=286.08s)]
*  coalition to the right, whether it's the defence secretary or others, suggesting of displacement [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=293.76s)]
*  of Gazans. Is that explicitly not the plan of the government? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  No, I think, you know, we welcome new ideas out of the box. We heard President Trump about [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=304.68s)]
*  these ideas. But you have to look at the goals of the military operation we started after [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=311.68s)]
*  October 7th. Very clear goals. Bring back the hostages, eliminate Hamas. That's what [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  we are focused on doing. I think after we achieve that, there will be a place to think [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=322.28s)]
*  about ideas. And I think it will be a better future for the Palestinians themselves. If [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  Hamas will stay in the game, will stay involved, there will be no hope for the Palestinians. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=332.32s)]
*  I do want to get into all of the details today about proportionality of achieving goals, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=338.88s)]
*  but I guess that would be what a lot of people might wonder. Just a final question, if I [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=343.11999999999995s)]
*  have the opportunity, Mr. President, to ask you, as the ambassador, to bring it back to the tragic [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=348.92s)]
*  events of this early morning. Do you think that the Jewish community across America is [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=354.92s)]
*  safe? Or is there a risk? Or do you feel confident that these incidents that we've seen this [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=361.92s)]
*  morning are thankfully few and far between? Or is the danger ever present? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=368.92s)]
*  I think the problem with terrorism is that it creates an atmosphere. So it is safe for Jews in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=374.92s)]
*  the United States. But when you see what happened last night in Washington, D.C., I'm sure [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=383.92s)]
*  everyone thinks about whether we should attend the service in a synagogue or attend an event that's [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=389.92s)]
*  part of the community. And that's what the terrorists want to achieve. But we have a strong [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=396.92s)]
*  community here. I'm sure they will continue to be supportive of Israel. And I believe that the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=400.92s)]
*  authorities will do what is necessary to protect the Jewish community here. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=405.92s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=410.92s)]
*  Thank you very much, Wilfer. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oILczcg-0T0&t=413.92s)]
