# Hamas confirms direct peace talks with US - as it calls on Trump to 'pressure' Israel
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg)
*  Thanks so much. As you say, some developing news coming out of Doha. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=0.0s)]
*  In what has already been an astonishing week in diplomacy and the art of deal [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  foreign policy that Donald Trump has been driving, as Donald Trump was leaving [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=12.0s)]
*  Doha, we sat down exclusively with one of the leaders of Hamas here in Qatar. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=17.2s)]
*  And don't forget, they have a political office here. And this is really a contact point [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=24.16s)]
*  for the international community, for Hamas. And we know since the beginning of this week that the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=30.24s)]
*  United States and Hamas were in talks, but it wasn't clear if it was through an intermediary [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=35.44s)]
*  like Qatar or Egypt or whether they were in direct talks or whether Hamas officials were directly [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=40.4s)]
*  talking to the Trump administration. In that exclusive interview that I did, it was confirmed [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=45.68s)]
*  that Hamas is in fact talking directly to the Trump administration. And they were very, well, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  I guess cautiously optimistic and positive in their tone about how Donald Trump was handling [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=59.28s)]
*  the situation here in the Middle East, whether it was meeting Ahmed al-Sharad, the president of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=65.52s)]
*  Syria yesterday, and lifting sanctions, or whether it was trying to bring about a nuclear deal [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=70.56s)]
*  with Iran or trying to prevent the Houthis in Yemen from launching rockets. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=76.8s)]
*  They said that they felt that Donald Trump had the will and the capability to bring about [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=82.08s)]
*  a peaceful and a ceasefire in Gaza. Let's just have a listen to what he had to say. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=88.48s)]
*  Are you willing to hand over all the hostages to bring an end to the bloodshed? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=94.56s)]
*  We have said it for all the mediators and for the Americans. We are ready to hand over [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=100.08s)]
*  all the prisoners immediately if we can be sure that this will lead to an end of this war [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=105.36s)]
*  and first and foremost to allow the humanitarian aid to get into Gaza. If these two conditions are [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  fulfilled, again, to allow aid to get into Gaza and to reach an end, to guarantee an end of this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=118.16s)]
*  war or genocide, yes, we are ready to hand over all the prisoners. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=125.76s)]
*  Are you telling the Americans this directly now? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=129.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=131.68s)]
*  What are you saying to them, that these are the things that you want and are you getting, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=132.32s)]
*  or do you get a sense that you're getting a positive response from them? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=136.56s)]
*  We have told them this proposal or comprehensive approach, one-shot prisoner exchange, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=140.88s)]
*  ending the war, total withdrawal of the Syrian forces, allowing all the aid to get into Gaza [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=148.56s)]
*  and rebuilding of Gaza Strip without forceful immigration through the mediators and directly [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=153.27999999999997s)]
*  through some persons in the US administrations. Sometimes we received a positive [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  response. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=169.68s)]
*  Do you have faith in the American teams and delegation that you're talking to, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=170.32s)]
*  that they too want to achieve an end to the conflict and be able to negotiate between the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=176.88s)]
*  two sides? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=184.64s)]
*  Look, we believe that President Trump has done a lot of work and hard work in different areas in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=187.04s)]
*  this region and outside the region. We have seen it in Ukraine. We have seen it in Syria. We have [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=194.56s)]
*  in Yemen. By adopting negotiations with Iran to solve this conflict, to de-escalate the tensions [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=199.12s)]
*  everywhere and to reach a more peaceful world. I think this is what is motivating us to continue [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=208.16s)]
*  contacting the American administration, regardless of the team, because we believe that he has done [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=217.28s)]
*  it and he can do it. I think President Trump has the capability and the will [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=223.68s)]
*  to reach this peaceful situation. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=232.8s)]
*  That was Dr. Bassem Naim, a senior official from Hamas, speaking to me a little earlier from here [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=236.72s)]
*  in Doha. Of course, as we've been reporting over the course of the last few days, the violence, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=244.32s)]
*  the war in Gaza continues, Israel continues to insist that unless all of their hostages have been [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=249.28s)]
*  released, they're not going to stop the bombardment, they're not going to stop the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=256.48s)]
*  airstrikes. And for its part, Hamas says that they need to get aid back into the territory. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=260.72s)]
*  They're not going to hand the hostages back until there is guarantee that all Israeli forces are [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=266.96s)]
*  going to withdraw from the territory. Let's just have a listen to my exchange with Dr. Bassem Naim [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=272.64s)]
*  about the humanitarian crisis and the death toll in Gaza, as well as the fact that they still have [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=280.0s)]
*  50 or so Israeli hostages in Gaza. Have a listen. We're seeing demonstrations in Gaza. We're seeing [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  people frustrated after 19 months of conflict that Hamas has brought on them. Yes, I respect [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=293.44s)]
*  all people who are going to the street to say yes for Hamas or no for Hamas because [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=301.44s)]
*  we have seen half of the Israeli population in the streets against Netanyahu. We are still seeing [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=307.12s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating against Trump president. We don't see that we [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=311.52s)]
*  are representing all Palestinians. We believe that we are still representing a vast majority of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=316.08s)]
*  Palestinians. If we go to the heart and the core of what has caused this latest devastation on the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=321.2s)]
*  Palestinian people 19, 20 months ago. The occupation since 75 years is the cause of all [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=326.0s)]
*  this devastation. But October 7 of this current devastation, 60,000 people dead as a result of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=331.12s)]
*  October 7. Because we have October 6, a lot of Palestinians were killed. We have before October 6. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=338.08s)]
*  60,000 people in the space of 20 months. Okay, between 2000 and 2023. And that is because of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=342.64s)]
*  October 7. And the Israelis say they will not stop until their hostages are released, until Hamas [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=348.88s)]
*  disarms itself and says that it no longer wishes to be the governing power. Why not? First of all, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=354.72s)]
*  again, as the occupied people, we have all the right to resist the occupation by all means, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=359.76000000000005s)]
*  including armed resistance. So you won't disarm. Let me continue. If you ask someone to be, this [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=364.56s)]
*  armed, it has to be the Israelis who have all the power, the chemical power, the nuclear power, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=370.8s)]
*  the biological power and all the support from the West, including the Americans, to destroy [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=375.6s)]
*  the Palestinian life like what we have seen along the 17 months. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=382.0s)]
*  But you still have 50 or so of their hostages that you haven't released. And it is in your gift, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=385.04s)]
*  it is in your power to release them. If Hamas hands the hostages over, if they disarm and they [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=391.92s)]
*  basically disappear from Gaza, they will end this conflict. Is that something that Hamas is willing [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=398.16s)]
*  to do? We are ready to go for one session to release all the captured Israelis and then return [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=403.12s)]
*  to get some of our prisoners. But with the guarantees that we are going to reach an end [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=409.52s)]
*  of this war, total withdrawal of the Saudi forces. That was Dr. Bassem Naim speaking to me there. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, in response to that exclusive interview, the White House National Security Council spokesperson [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=424.24s)]
*  gave us this statement. He said Hamas has not demonstrated that they are serious about peace. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=430.47999999999996s)]
*  And the president has been clear Hamas must lay down their arms. Hamas continues to wrongfully [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=436.4s)]
*  hold hostages, including American bodies, in the dungeons of Gaza, who could easily be freed and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  have shown no changes in behavior to indicate they will cease to attack civilians. But we did ask [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=447.12s)]
*  them if to confirm what Hamas was saying about being in direct talks with the administration. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=453.84s)]
*  They haven't responded to that, but have continued to remain stern about the fact that Hamas has 50 [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=458.23999999999995s)]
*  or so Israeli hostages in their captivity in Gaza. So we will be following these developments, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=464.88s)]
*  including some of the statements that President Donald Trump made earlier today, where he said [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=471.44s)]
*  that he wanted to turn Gaza into a freedom zone. He said the U.S. should take it and turn it into [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=476.64s)]
*  a freedom zone. He also was incredibly stern about Hamas, and he said they needed to be dealt with. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=483.76s)]
*  We know behind the scenes now based on what Hamas is saying, that the United States and Hamas are [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=490.08s)]
*  in direct talks. You can of course see the extended version of my interview with Hamas at 9 p.m. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=495.76s)]
*  on the world on my show tonight. But for now, Jane, back to you. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CYNnAh4Mvg&t=502.15999999999997s)]
