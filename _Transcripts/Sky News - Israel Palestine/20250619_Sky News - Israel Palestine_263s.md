# Dr Rose: 'There are very limited amounts of aid we can offer'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg)
*  Dr. Rose, that was an incredibly difficult watch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=0.0s)]
*  And I imagine for you and your colleagues, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=4.84s)]
*  your Palestinian colleagues on the ground, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=7.28s)]
*  every day was difficult and tough. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=9.4s)]
*  And we got that sense watching the aspects of your life there [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=11.08s)]
*  that you filmed. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=16.16s)]
*  But you talked about how difficult it was going to be leaving. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=17.12s)]
*  Do you have an update, especially on some of the children [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  that remain in those hospitals? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=23.68s)]
*  Yeah, we do have an update. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=25.64s)]
*  And the main thing that's happened since we left [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=27.44s)]
*  is that NASA has gone into the red zone. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  So it's actually now in an evacuation zone. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=35.0s)]
*  Although the hospital hasn't been ordered to evacuate, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=39.4s)]
*  the staff have to deconflict their journeys. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=42.92s)]
*  So that means that they have to coordinate with the IEF [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=46.0s)]
*  to come in and out of the hospital. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=49.28s)]
*  And that's had a real knock-on effect in the way [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=52.88s)]
*  that the hospital functions. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=56.56s)]
*  And for the patients that are within that hospital [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  now that it is in the red zone? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=65.56s)]
*  So a lot evacuated themselves, all of the walking wounded [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=70.76s)]
*  that could leave left. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=75.48s)]
*  But the real issue is that there are [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=76.88s)]
*  48 patients in the intensive care unit. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=80.28s)]
*  And none of the hospitals around NASA [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=84.8s)]
*  have the capability to manage intensive care patients. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=88.76s)]
*  Of MSF Belgium, of ICRC, the Kuwait and the Jordanian [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=94.8s)]
*  could not take ICU patients. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=100.84s)]
*  And none of those field hospitals can generate [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=103.08s)]
*  oxygen. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=107.08s)]
*  NASA is the only hospital in the south of Gaza [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  that has an oxygen station. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=112.36s)]
*  It's also the only hospital that has a CT scanner [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  and the only hospital that has a blood bank. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  So if NASA does go back to operation, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=122.24s)]
*  which is very likely now that it's in the red zone, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=127.24s)]
*  it's very likely now that it's in the red zone. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=132.24s)]
*  Dr. Rose, you warned before you left [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=138.56s)]
*  that one of the things that worried you [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  is that if things get worse than what they are [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=143.44s)]
*  and it seems like it has now that it's in the red zone [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  that there wouldn't be much to go back to. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=150.12s)]
*  Is that the sense you still have? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  I think for us it's very difficult [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=157.8s)]
*  for medical healthcare personnel to go back [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=159.6s)]
*  and not have a hospital to work in. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=164.12s)]
*  There is very limited amounts of aid we can offer [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=168.32s)]
*  from a field hospital. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=172.76s)]
*  The field hospitals are not designed to give trauma care. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=174.56s)]
*  They're designed as triage centers. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  So if there are no left standing hospitals in Gaza, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=182.24s)]
*  we are very limited in what we can offer the population. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=186.76s)]
*  And Dr. Rose, is there anything that you would urge [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=192.92s)]
*  the British government to do at this point? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=195.88s)]
*  We saw there in the piece, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=197.92s)]
*  the fact that there've just been so few people, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=200.32s)]
*  so few children that have been evacuated [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  out of the country and out of the territory [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  and that is one of the issues. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=208.04s)]
*  Well, there is a lot we can do. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=212.92s)]
*  I think the evacuation of children [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=214.2s)]
*  is possibly the most important, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=216.56s)]
*  particularly now that Kogut seems to be allowing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=218.4s)]
*  more children to leave. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  And definitely the UK, which has only taken two children, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=222.8s)]
*  does need to step up and accept more [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=226.8s)]
*  like the rest of its European compadres. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=229.68s)]
*  The other thing that we can do [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=233.56s)]
*  is continually put pressure on Israel. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=235.0s)]
*  This is a human rights issue [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=237.44s)]
*  and they cannot take out the last standing hospital [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=239.16s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=243.12s)]
*  There's a lot of work being done [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  by our Jewish colleagues in Israel now [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  to try and lobby the government [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=249.4s)]
*  to get the IDF to move away from this area. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think anything that we can do to support that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  would mean that the healthcare system in Gaza [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=258.36s)]
*  will not completely collapse. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ae_nn-97jg&t=261.04s)]
