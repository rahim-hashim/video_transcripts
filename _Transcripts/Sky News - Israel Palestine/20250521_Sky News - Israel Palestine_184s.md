# Could Britain do more to restrict military exports to Israel?
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ)
*  The UK has taken its most forceful steps against Israel since the start of the Gaza War, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  suspending free trade talks and sanctioning settlers in the West Bank. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=5.2s)]
*  But what about arms sales? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=9.4s)]
*  Could Britain be doing more to restrict exports to Israel? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=10.8s)]
*  This graph shows what Britain has been supplying in recent years. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=14.6s)]
*  It shows the value of approved licences, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=17.8s)]
*  a relatively steady rate over the past few years. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=20.6s)]
*  But in the last three months of last year, there was a big increase, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=24.2s)]
*  more than £127 million of arms sent to Israel. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=28.0s)]
*  That is more than the total for the previous three years. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=32.2s)]
*  So how did that happen? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=35.6s)]
*  Much of the increase appears to be replacing parts for existing systems [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=38.0s)]
*  rather than entirely new arms. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=41.2s)]
*  And there may have been a catch-up effect after the fall in exports during the pandemic years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=43.4s)]
*  But there are certainly questions for the government to answer, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=48.0s)]
*  especially given the timing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=51.2s)]
*  Because the Foreign Secretary David Lammy had said in September [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=54.0s)]
*  that the UK was suspending around 30 of 350 licences over concerns [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=57.4s)]
*  the equipment could be used to breach international law. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  The suspended licences include those providing components for military aircraft, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=66.8s)]
*  including fighter jets, helicopters and drones, which are all used for attacks in Gaza. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=71.4s)]
*  The UK is continuing to approve items which it assessed are not directly used in Gaza, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=77.8s)]
*  including training aircraft, naval equipment and communication equipment. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=83.4s)]
*  Most controversially, an exemption was made allowing the continued supply of parts for F-35 fighter jets, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  including ejector seats and targeting lasers. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  The government is facing a high court legal challenge on this, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=97.2s)]
*  with opponents saying F-35s are a key part of Israel's aerial war on Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  Britain says withholding those parts would disrupt the entire global supply chain for F-35, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=106.4s)]
*  saying the programme is vital to the security of the UK and its allies. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=111.4s)]
*  Why does he think it's OK for the UK to continue to sell Israel the equipment for the fighter jets [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=117.0s)]
*  to drop bombs on these starving children? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=124.0s)]
*  What we contribute into a pot is parts for fighter jets. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  They're not sold directly, they go into a pot. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  If we were to stop that, they wouldn't then be available to others around the world [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=137.0s)]
*  who desperately need them in the conflicts they're engaged in. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=140.8s)]
*  And that's why we won't do it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=143.4s)]
*  Lawyers for the British government in that F-35 court case argued there is no evidence [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=146.4s)]
*  of a genocide being committed in Gaza, putting them at odds with some other observers, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=150.8s)]
*  or that the Israeli military has deliberately targeted women or children, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  even if tens of thousands have been killed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  But the British government has said the new Israeli offensive in Gaza is morally unjustifiable [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  and is clearly worried about talk from Israeli ministers of cleansing Gaza. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=168.0s)]
*  The action it's taking against Israel is unlikely to be the last [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=173.2s)]
*  if the situation there continues to deteriorate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD9J0H3MaUQ&t=176.6s)]
