# Dozens of Palestinians 'shot dead while getting food' in Gaza | Israel-Hamas war
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk)
*  This is the daily humiliating dawn trek just to eat. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=0.0s)]
*  People scavenge for anything they can find amongst the boxes of aid in one of the distribution hubs. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=8.0s)]
*  And it has become a lethal gauntlet. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=15.0s)]
*  The efforts to get aid into Gaza have turned into chaos. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=18.0s)]
*  The Israeli-backed aid stations run by private contractors have become an uncontrolled frenzy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=21.0s)]
*  And for the third day in a row, dozens of Palestinians were shot dead as they went to get food. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=28.0s)]
*  We were out bringing bread about one and a half kilometres away from the Israeli tanks. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=40.0s)]
*  We were surprised that shots and shelling were being fired at us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=44.0s)]
*  Everyone fell on the ground and people were stepping on dead bodies. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=48.0s)]
*  It's not normal. The enemy is not normal. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=51.0s)]
*  I was on the way at 3.30 in the morning. There was a shooting and I laid down. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=54.0s)]
*  I don't know how the bullet hit my head. This is what happened to me. I don't know. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=60.0s)]
*  The IDF has admitted opening fire after some suspects had moved towards them. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=68.0s)]
*  They say they had deviated from a designated route. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=73.0s)]
*  The Israeli army, they issued warning shots in the air. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=78.0s)]
*  And still, some of these suspects continued to advance towards the troops in a threatening manner. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=82.0s)]
*  Many of the patients were taken to Nasser Hospital in Karnunis. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=91.0s)]
*  This man had been shot in the neck. There was no space for him in the emergency department. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=95.0s)]
*  All the beds were already full. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=100.0s)]
*  Everywhere, there were walking wounded with blood on their clothes from bullet holes. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=103.0s)]
*  Israel says that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is working. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=111.0s)]
*  International aid organisations all say it isn't. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=116.0s)]
*  Many children are sharing with us now that they wish to be dead, that they don't want to be here anymore. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=120.0s)]
*  They want to be with their mothers or fathers who've died. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=127.0s)]
*  They want to go to paradise or heaven where there is food and water. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=130.0s)]
*  And this is absolutely desperate for this generation of children who see no hope, they see no future. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=134.0s)]
*  The United Nations has said the attacks on civilians going to get aid could be a war crime. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=142.0s)]
*  The Israeli government says the aid hubs are working well. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=148.0s)]
*  And the IDF has said it's expanding the military operation to control the whole of Gaza. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=151.0s)]
*  We are doing everything we can in order to allow for this food to be distributed in an organised fashion [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=157.0s)]
*  and to make sure that the aid does not reach the hands of Hamas. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=164.0s)]
*  The two aid hubs that are open are in the very south of Gaza. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=167.0s)]
*  The walk to get there is many kilometres in the hours before sunrise. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=172.0s)]
*  And it is first come, first served. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=177.0s)]
*  The survival of the fittest in a place where almost everybody is already starving. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=180.0s)]
*  Alistair Bunkle, Sky News in Jerusalem. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rPPgTYhKk&t=187.0s)]
