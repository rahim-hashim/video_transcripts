**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI)
*  of IAF fighter jets flew and managed to strike at dozens of sites and targets all over Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=0.0s)]
*  Now we're going to expose to you the Natanz nuclear site which we exposed earlier. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=10.72s)]
*  During the past few hours we have attacked the largest enrichment site in Iran, which [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=16.0s)]
*  is 1500 kilometers away from Israel. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=21.46s)]
*  This facility served the Revolutionary Guards to advance the nuclear program, the military [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=24.6s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=31.18s)]
*  As you can see the site is in the Natanz region. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=32.52s)]
*  There is a very large underground hall there that goes several floors down with centrifuges [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=35.56s)]
*  and infrastructure and electricity. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  We've attacked this underground facility and some other crucial infrastructure at this [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  site. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  We have significantly impacted and harmed this site. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=50.1s)]
*  For many years the people of the Iranian regime made an effort to obtain nuclear arms in this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=54.660000000000004s)]
*  facility. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=60.74s)]
*  It has the necessary infrastructure to enrich Iran to a military grade. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=61.74s)]
*  For many years the world has tried to stop the Iranian regime to stop, but it refused [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=67.1s)]
*  to do so. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=72.94s)]
*  So we were left with no choice but to take action. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=73.94s)]
*  The Iranian regime continues to strive to annihilate the state of Israel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=76.34s)]
*  We cannot allow them to do so. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  This morning we have announced the targeted killing of the most senior commanders, three [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=83.78s)]
*  most senior commanders of the Iranian regime. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=90.38000000000001s)]
*  In addition, in the joint initial strike we also targeted Amir Ali Fadhi Zadeh, who is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  the Air Force commander of the Revolutionary Guards. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=99.86s)]
*  Under his command, this Revolutionary Guards Air Force is responsible for many attacks [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=103.0s)]
*  against Israeli and Israeli citizens. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=108.08s)]
*  They are responsible for the launching of hundreds of drones and missiles in April and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=110.04s)]
*  then last October. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=115.2s)]
*  He carried out dozens of terror attacks over the years. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=116.68s)]
*  These activities have harmed Israelis as well as citizens of other countries. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=120.0s)]
*  He led the drone attack against countries in the Middle East and also targeted various [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=124.64s)]
*  maritime vessels in ports and in international waters. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=131.8s)]
*  Fadhi Zadeh has been targeted along with other commanders when he was in the Revolutionary [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=135.76s)]
*  Guards Air Force headquarters where they were planning an attack on Israel and preparing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=143.24s)]
*  for it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=148.72s)]
*  The targeted killing of the top brass of the Iranian military and the nuclear scientists [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=149.72s)]
*  was done following a meticulous preparation of the Israeli intel community. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=157.72s)]
*  The IDF is continuing to prepare for additional strikes and to defend the state of Israel. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=163.84s)]
*  In the early hours of the morning before the attack, we decided to give an early warning [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=169.72s)]
*  to all Israelis because we understood that there could be a strike at the Israeli home [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=174.92s)]
*  front. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=179.96s)]
*  So we prepared you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=180.96s)]
*  The Air Force is still acting in order to intercept and thwart any threats. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=181.96s)]
*  You Israelis need to continue and act with responsibility and calmness. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=187.28s)]
*  We have very, very strong air defense systems and they're operating all over in order to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=193.4s)]
*  protect Israel. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=199.24s)]
*  But it's never 100% foolproof, the protection. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=200.84s)]
*  A few hours ago, the home front command announced a special situation and updated the instructions. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=204.28s)]
*  Please stay tuned because there could be changes and please abide by the instructions of the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=211.16s)]
*  home front command. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=215.96s)]
*  We will do everything necessary in order to protect the state of Israel and its citizens. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm here and I'm going to continue to explain and update on any development questions. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=227.08s)]
*  Could the Israeli citizens prepare for an emergency situation that could last weeks? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=232.4s)]
*  We need to prepare for a long campaign. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  The IDF is very well prepared both on the offense and the defense to continue to act [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=243.12s)]
*  until we achieve our goals. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=248.68s)]
*  Channel 12, were the Israeli senior officers surprised that there wasn't any significant [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  strike back from Iran? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=257.24s)]
*  You must remember that we just started this operation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  Iran has both the capabilities and the intentions as we've seen. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  The IDF took action in Iran and it surprised them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=268.16s)]
*  This is why they didn't strike back with surface to surface missiles. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=271.12s)]
*  But we're monitoring the situation in Iran. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=275.52s)]
*  We're preparing for a response. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=277.52s)]
*  We know that they're preparing to retaliate. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=279.64s)]
*  We'll continue to act and defend all Israeli citizens. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=282.28s)]
*  I-24 News. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=285.08s)]
*  President Trump said a short while ago that the next attacks in Iran will be even more [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=286.8s)]
*  brutal. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=291.4s)]
*  What can you tell us about the plans for any additional strikes? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=292.4s)]
*  I can tell you that the IDF operates according to a well prepared and gradual program. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=295.36s)]
*  We have decided goals and we will continue to act in order to achieve these goals. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=300.76s)]
*  Channel 14 question. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  How does Israel continue to strike at the nuclear site at Porto? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  Once again, we have specific goals and targets for this campaign. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=312.56s)]
*  It's gradual. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=317.76s)]
*  I'm not going to share the operational targets we're going to strike for obvious reasons. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=319.24s)]
*  Mako News. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=324.92s)]
*  In the past it was said that in order to destroy Iranian nuclear capabilities, Israel needs [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=325.92s)]
*  the help of the U.S. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=330.56s)]
*  So assuming that the U.S. is not participating in the attack, is it something that Israel [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=331.56s)]
*  can achieve to wipe out Iranian nuclear capabilities? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=336.2s)]
*  First of all, we will act in any way we can. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  And we have ways, as we've shown, in order to remove this threat, the IDF and the Air [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=343.24s)]
*  Force, the entire IDF has significant capabilities. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  We are going to continue to act in all capabilities we have in order to obtain the goals of this [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM3uifalfMI&t=351.35999999999996s)]
