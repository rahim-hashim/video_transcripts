Video Description: Oil prices have risen after Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities.
A barrel of the benchmark Brent Crude oil has risen more than 7.5%, a high not seen since Donald Trump's so-called liberation day tariff announcement more than two months ago.
Iran is a producer of oil but also controls the Strait of Hormuz, a major shipping lane.
Israel says it launched more than 100 strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities overnight.

# Global oil prices rise as markets react to Israel's attack on Iran
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c)
*  Now, back to our top story and the repercussions of what is going on, reaching out far and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=0.0s)]
*  wider, not least in financial markets. Oil prices have risen, as they often do, after [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=8.64s)]
*  that Israeli strike in Iran in the early hours of this morning. Of course, a hit to an oil-producing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  state in an oil-producing region does tend to spook the oil markets and spark fears of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=22.0s)]
*  potential broader or continued conflict as well. Let's bring in our business and economics [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=28.64s)]
*  correspondent Gopri Narwan. Afternoon to you, Gopri. Just talk us through the way in which [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=34.68s)]
*  the financial markets are responding to what has happened overnight. Well, it's perhaps [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=40.96s)]
*  unsurprising that the oil price has gone up off the back of this. We often see this response [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=45.64s)]
*  in the oil markets when there's a flare-up in the Middle East. Of course, the question [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=51.68s)]
*  is how prolonged will this conflict be? How will it escalate? And that will determine [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=56.28s)]
*  what the impact on the financial markets and on the broader global economy will be. So [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=61.44s)]
*  I'll just start with the numbers for you, as you can see there on the screen. Brent [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=65.44s)]
*  Crude, that's the international oil benchmark that was trading at just under $75 a barrel, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=68.56s)]
*  up 8%, although it opened up close to 8%, 7.11 now. It's changing all the time, I suppose. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=75.36s)]
*  It opened up 12%. That was the initial spike. And investors are pouring into safe haven [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=82.0s)]
*  assets, things like US government debt. So bond yields are down, bond prices are up. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=88.72s)]
*  Also the dollar as well as gold. And then as you can probably expect, energy stocks [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=96.52s)]
*  are on the up. So Shell, for example, and BP up 2% and 2.1% in total energies. And the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=103.16s)]
*  French company up 2.1% airlines are not having a good day because of the travel disruption [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=109.84s)]
*  that's taking place across airspace in the Middle East. Airline stocks are down. So we're [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  talking about kind of the impact on the financial markets. But what about the broader global [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=123.12s)]
*  economy? Well, all of this, when we talk about the oil price, has an impact on consumers [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=127.76s)]
*  here in the UK and in the US across the world. Because when oil prices go up, I mean, the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  obvious impact is that there's a quick feed through into petrol prices. But oil goes into [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=137.96s)]
*  the manufacturing process of most of the goods that we consume. So when oil prices go up, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  that means the cost of goods and services goes up. That means inflation rises. And of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=148.16s)]
*  course, all of this will probably dampen the likelihood of the Bank of England and the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=152.84s)]
*  US Federal Reserve being able to cut interest rates over the coming months. But of course, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=157.68s)]
*  things change pretty quickly. It all depends on how this escalates. And kind of one of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=163.92s)]
*  the things that analysts are really looking closely at is the impact on not just oil, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  it's obviously an oil producing region, but also the waterways, some of those maritime [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=174.88s)]
*  thoroughfares in the Middle East that are critical for the transportation of oil, but [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=179.2s)]
*  also of container shipping, so goods going to either Asia or into Europe. And we've already [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  seen some supply constraints in that region. So the Houthi rebels, the Yemenis rebels who [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  are backed by Iran have been causing disruption in the Red Sea, flanked by the Suez Canal, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=197.64s)]
*  one of the key shipping lanes in the world. It remains to be seen kind of how Iran responds, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  but they could stir more trouble in that region. And then of course, the Strait of Hormuz, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  I think it's about a quarter of the world's oil trade flows through there. If Iran wanted [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=214.27999999999997s)]
*  to take an extreme option, it could block that, which would block cargo ships from collecting [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  oil from nations across the region, whether it's Saudi Arabia or the UAE. Now, it's not [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=227.6s)]
*  to say that any of that's going to happen, but these are the kind of things that analysts [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=232.27999999999997s)]
*  are thinking about. And all of that will determine the impact on commodity prices and the impact [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  on the global economy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4HUrOLnq6c&t=240.44s)]
