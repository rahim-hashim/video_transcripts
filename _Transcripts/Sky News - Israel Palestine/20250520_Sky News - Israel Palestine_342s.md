Video Description: UNICEF has joined calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza to allow more desperately needed aid to cross the border, after five trucks were allowed in yesterday.

The UN is warning that 14,000 babies could die in the next 48 hours if aid supplies don't reach them.

UNICEF spokesperson James Elder says the only thing getting into Gaza for months "has been bombs" and they are losing children from "bombardments from the sky, from disease and from malnutrition." 

He added: 'It's horrendous. There have been cases of starvation. It doesn't leave you."

# UNICEF: 'If we're serious about peace, there has to be a ceasefire' in Gaza
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg)
*  UNICEF who joins me now. James, our understanding yesterday is that five trucks were allowed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=0.0s)]
*  across the crossing but not actually into Gaza proper. As far as you're aware, has any aid [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=5.36s)]
*  actually got into Gaza yet? I think a handful of trucks have, Jane, in the last couple of hours. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=10.24s)]
*  That's our understanding and of course, look, you have to welcome every truck, every pallet, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=16.64s)]
*  but we cannot pretend that this trickle is anything like a solution we need. I mean, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=20.56s)]
*  there is enough food to feed a million people for four months but it's on the wrong side of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=24.72s)]
*  the border and as you say there, Jane, it's been at the wrong side of the border for two and a half [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=29.04s)]
*  months. So two and a half months of a population on their knees with the world's foremost nutritional [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=33.04s)]
*  body warning of famine and the only thing, the only thing getting into Gaza that women and children [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=38.72s)]
*  have seen until the last 24 hours have been bombs. How quickly, once this gets across the border, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=43.76s)]
*  can you guys get it distributed to the population? Look, an organisation like UNICEF, we're last mile [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  delivery so very quickly, Jane, and this is a big thing on aid diversion, we don't give [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=56.64s)]
*  aid to Hamas, we go straight to the people. Food goes to a child, vaccination goes into an arm, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=60.96s)]
*  but it's just not simply enough. During the ceasefire, which was such a critical time, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=66.16s)]
*  Jane, it was the lifeline, the ceasefire got hostages home, let aid flow and of course, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=70.24s)]
*  allowed families to promise their kids they could go to bed and not be bombed overnight. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=75.6s)]
*  There were 600 trucks a day, humanitarian and commercial, 600, we're talking what, five or [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=79.84s)]
*  six after two and a half months, that's why, that's why we have these reports of people starving, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=86.24s)]
*  that's why UNICEF has seen the nutritional state, we've seen a doubling in malnutrition in the last [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  month, so it's an enormous effort we're facing now and we're also facing in a highly militarised [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=96.24s)]
*  zone, the level of attacks are more ferocious in the last couple of weeks than they have been for [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  months. You talk about the threat of malnutrition really rising in the last few weeks, how grave is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=106.24s)]
*  the situation in terms of health for so many people there? It's horrendous Jane, I mean, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=111.76s)]
*  there have been cases of starvation and I've seen that, it doesn't leave you, starvation of a child [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=117.68s)]
*  is basically where their body starts to feed on itself, first it's fat and then it's muscle and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  then that child which was going through enormous amounts of pain suddenly stops crying and that's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  where you then realise that the body has just given up and remembering this is not some far-flung [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=134.08s)]
*  crisis, this is not a crisis where we need to do airdrops, all the humanitarian aid we need is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=138.48s)]
*  at a border and has just been at a border, so it needs to flow but for a lot of those children [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  it's too late, there is no doubt we are losing children from the bombardments from the sky and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=149.92s)]
*  from disease and malnutrition on the ground Jane because they go hand in hand malnutrition and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=154.16s)]
*  lack of sanitation, nine in ten people in Gaza, women and children have to choose every day, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  the limited water they have, do they use it to drink or do they use it to clean and so when [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=164.4s)]
*  you malnourish and then you bring in diseases because the sanitation system has been devastated [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=168.96s)]
*  that's the vicious cycle, that's what kills children. We saw overnight a statement from [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney in Canada condemning what is happening and using [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=179.36s)]
*  quite strong words, what did you make of this statement, do you feel that something has shifted [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  the language, feels to have moved up a level? I think it has but I think you know for I was [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=189.76s)]
*  first in Gaza Jane in November 2023 and it was very clear what was happening then, it was very [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=196.0s)]
*  clear the level of indiscriminate attacks, what was happening in hospitals, you know the seeing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  children burnt in their homes and again seeing the denials of aid, so there is no doubt that those [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  with leverage need to absolutely use it, this already is a stain but there are families holding [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  on, when I talk to families they talk about we are surviving, that's the benchmark, so yes all of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=218.16s)]
*  those of course, all those officials, anyone with leverage needs to use every aspect of their [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=222.96s)]
*  leverage of course and for those in Gaza it has to go beyond language of course. What would you [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=227.04s)]
*  like to see in terms of action? It's got to be a ceasefire, you know it's still abhorrent, there [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=232.72s)]
*  you know there are mums or brothers or sisters who are hostages somewhere in Gaza, a ceasefire [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=237.92s)]
*  lets aid flow, a ceasefire ensures aid workers can work without being killed, it's the most [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=243.36s)]
*  number of aid workers killed of any conflict since World War II and remembering ceasefires have been [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=249.12s)]
*  the game changer forever, even just if we talk of hostages during ceasefires, during negotiations [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  Jane we've had 150 hostages go home, under military means it's less than 10, so if we're serious [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  about Gazans, women, children getting hostages home, bringing some peace to that region, it has [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=265.6s)]
*  to be a ceasefire. We're seeing a butting up of words in international politics about this, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=271.52s)]
*  I wonder what it's like on the ground between your aid workers and the Israeli authorities [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=278.32s)]
*  on these checkpoints, what is the atmosphere like down there? Well the last couple of months of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  course around checkpoints we've had no aid so there's been no distribution, there's nothing [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=290.08s)]
*  coming in, prior to that look you know they are the occupying power, it's done with the greatest [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=294.96s)]
*  respect, the job of the United Nations is simply to go through all the requirements of clearances [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=300.8s)]
*  of loading and unloading and get that aid to people. Having said that, having been to Gaza [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=305.6s)]
*  numerous times Jane, I've seen the games played, I've been stopped for six or seven hours for no [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=310.24s)]
*  possible reasons, turned back, allowed only to move into a highly militarised zone at night time [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=315.04s)]
*  knowing we'd have to return. So the United Nations you know we don't have weapons, all we can do is [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  goodwill and follow all the rules but following those rules does not always get aid to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  the children and to the families in Gaza. Okay James Elder from UNICEF, really good to talk to you, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=331.11999999999995s)]
*  thanks very much for joining us. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1T8Ez6n5bg&t=337.76s)]
