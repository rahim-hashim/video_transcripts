# What's happening with aid in Gaza?
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs)
*  Yesterday Israel said 107 aid trucks were sent into Gaza, which is only a fraction of what's needed on a daily basis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=0.0s)]
*  But the Israelis say that there's a new distribution system to be rolled out from tomorrow. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=6.0s)]
*  It's all very complex, so what is actually going on? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=11.0s)]
*  Aid trucks cross the border into Gaza, but getting across the border is only the first stage. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=14.0s)]
*  The next question is how is the aid distributed and by whom? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=19.0s)]
*  Does Hamas get hold of all of the aid? No, they don't, but they certainly get hold of some of it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=23.0s)]
*  There are lots of reports of aid convoys now being attacked by desperate civilians, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=27.0s)]
*  and there is violence taking place and disorder because the aid isn't being distributed in the way that it was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=32.0s)]
*  by the United Nations organisation that knows how to do it and has a whole system set up to organise it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=38.0s)]
*  So although some aid is going into Gaza now, it's going in in a chaotic way, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=44.0s)]
*  and it's not clear at all that most of this aid is actually even reaching the people that it's supposed to reach. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=50.0s)]
*  What the Israeli government says is that they're not going to rely on the United Nations anymore to distribute aid [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=56.0s)]
*  because they don't trust the UN and they've fallen out with it over many years, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=61.0s)]
*  but they're going to set up their own aid distribution system based on what they call the Gaza Humanitarian Organisation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=64.0s)]
*  And this GHO is basically made up of private companies, mainly American companies, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=71.0s)]
*  and they, it is said, will distribute aid in four centres, three of them in the south and the south-west, one of them in the north. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=77.0s)]
*  And instead of taking, as it were, food to the starving, this model is based on the idea that the starving will move to the food. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=84.0s)]
*  And of course the United Nations will have nothing to do with this because they say this is ethnic cleansing, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=91.0s)]
*  this is using aid as a weapon to make people move to where you want them to move, in this case mainly to the south-west of Gaza. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=95.0s)]
*  Gaza is a very small territory, it's five miles wide and 30 miles long, 2.3 million people live there, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=103.0s)]
*  and it's got the same population density as Greater London. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=110.0s)]
*  And now it looks as if the Israeli government is trying to use food distribution as a way of getting 2.3 million people into an even smaller part of this very small territory. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=113.0s)]
*  And that's causing a great deal of international anguish and quite a lot of international opposition. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=123.0s)]
*  We'll see where it goes in the next few days, as from tomorrow it is supposed to start operating. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKz7Kxp6Srs&t=128.0s)]
