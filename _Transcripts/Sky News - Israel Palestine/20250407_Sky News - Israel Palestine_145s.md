# Sky challenges Israeli govt over medic death claims
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE)
*  Alistair Bunkle from Sky News. Let me read your question here. The IDF initially claimed that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=0.0s)]
*  eight of the 15 medics were killed were Hamas. This is now being revised down to six. Given that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=7.92s)]
*  the initial reports about the ambulances not using their emergency lights have now been exposed as [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  false and the lack of any evidence provided so far to prove some of the medics were Hamas, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=19.52s)]
*  why should we conclude that they're anything but innocent medical and aid workers? And you've also [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=25.36s)]
*  asked what steps have been taken by the IDF whilst the international investigation proceeds? Have [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=30.72s)]
*  soldiers been involved, involved been withdrawn from duties in Gaza? Alistair, there's an issue [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=35.12s)]
*  which I almost never see reported in international media and that is the fact that it is a matter of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=41.92s)]
*  record that Hamas have on many occasions, many documented occasions, used ambulances as a cover. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=49.28s)]
*  What sort of cover? To transport terrorists, to escape from Israel's forces, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=59.84s)]
*  abusing the very notion of emergency services. Just like the boy that cried wolf in Aesop's fables, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  Hamas have been abusing emergency services and that is the real essence of this issue. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=76.48s)]
*  But on the reports about the attack on aid workers in Rafa whilst on a stakeout against [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=84.56s)]
*  terrorist activity, against terrorist activity, IDF soldiers opened fire from a distance at [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=91.12s)]
*  vehicles that were moving suspiciously in their direction, among the dead were six Hamas [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=96.8s)]
*  terrorists. What were Hamas terrorists doing in ambulances? The incident was reported in real time [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  to UN officials, the IDF is conducting an investigation as you know into the circumstances of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  the incident that took place two weeks ago. The Hamas terror organisation systematically violates [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  international law by taking over civilian facilities and infrastructure including hospitals, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=122.0s)]
*  schools and mosques while cruelly exploiting and placing the civilian population in Gaza at risk [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=129.04s)]
*  by using it as a human shield for its actions. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJJ1TCIUaJE&t=137.68s)]
