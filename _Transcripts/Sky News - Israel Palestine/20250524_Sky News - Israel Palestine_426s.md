# Surgeon on the latest strike in Gaza: 'It's something we'd never want to see'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc)
*  Perhaps you could start by describing the type of injuries that you're treating and seeing and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=0.0s)]
*  and how tough it is to treat people under these conditions. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=6.16s)]
*  Hi, hello, thank you. Yes, the majority of the injuries we're treating are blast injuries, so [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=12.32s)]
*  fractures involving lower limbs, upper limbs, massive wounds with missing parts, amputations, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=21.36s)]
*  severe burns. It's pretty much what we are finding and it's really tough to treat these [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=35.68s)]
*  injuries with the very little that we have available here. We are running short of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=43.68s)]
*  like loads of things at the moment, so yesterday one of the nurses was telling me that we're [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=59.12s)]
*  really short on other medical supplies such as gloves, very basic things and it's very [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=66.8s)]
*  difficult to treat these kind of injuries if population is really malnourished and we are [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=74.64s)]
*  very short and we have very small variety of antibiotics. Yeah and I appreciate it's hard [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  for you to talk about specifics but the news today of those nine siblings being killed, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=92.0s)]
*  the children of two doctors based where you are at NASA hospital, it must have hit the medical [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=97.12s)]
*  community particularly hard. Yeah, unfortunately it's not the first time this happens and it's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=101.6s)]
*  really heartbreaking as every other person that we receive here wounded or severely injured. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=115.12s)]
*  Yesterday we had this, last night we received the husband of this pediatrician who is working, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=125.2s)]
*  was actually working at the time her house was hit by an airstrike and yeah she lost nine out of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=134.96s)]
*  ten of her kids and her husband is severely injured so yeah absolutely [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=145.52s)]
*  it's something that we would never want to see. Of course and you talked about signs of malnutrition [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=152.8s)]
*  and we're hearing about the dangers of starvation particularly amongst children and babies. Are you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  seeing signs of that? Just describe what you've experienced. Yeah absolutely we struggle to figure [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=171.52s)]
*  because when we compare the age that we see on the medical notes and then we see the actual patient [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=182.0s)]
*  it looks completely different so if a patient is reported for like to be seven years old and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  when you see them sometimes they look like four they're so tiny, so little, so thin and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=197.28s)]
*  that makes everything much more difficult because wounds don't heal if people are malnourished. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=205.04s)]
*  Also I mean there has been, I've seen many patients that we couldn't even operate on just because [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=210.8s)]
*  their weight is too low they wouldn't be able to recover from an anesthetic or from [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=222.96s)]
*  a dressing or a de-brightening in the theater that would involve loss of blood so it restricts a lot [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  what we can do. Of course and we've seen a lot of hospitals being damaged, some now completely [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=239.44s)]
*  out of action. Is that something else that you fear that where you are could also suffer that as well? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=248.96s)]
*  So on Tuesday when the evacuation order came up we were really worried that because it's really [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=258.8s)]
*  the area that has been ordered to be evacuated is really near our hospital so our worry was [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=266.4s)]
*  that if they're gonna close Nasser hospital and the hospital has to be evacuated this is one of the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=273.52s)]
*  last big hospitals that has ITUs, oxygen generators, big operating room that can't provide [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=281.12s)]
*  high complex types of surgeries so if this is going to be evacuated lots of people will just die. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=290.4s)]
*  And you're having to work whilst this violence is going on around you as well which must be [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=301.12s)]
*  not only terrifying but also concerning especially if you're in the middle of a procedure or an operation? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=315.2s)]
*  Yeah it's not ideal. We are operating about 12 hours a day. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=320.96s)]
*  The volume of patients that we receive is absolutely incredible and we never stop and we operate [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=339.28s)]
*  roughly like 10-11 patients a day and they're all big cases and then we come back [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=349.36s)]
*  in the accommodation which is still in the hospital and all we can hear is bombs and drones over our [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  heads so it's definitely not the best but this is something that we are experiencing for a short time [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  and I just can't believe how these people have been managing for so long. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=372.0s)]
*  Of course and given everything that you're having to witness and you've not been in Gaza [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=380.96s)]
*  a huge amount of time how do you look after your own tiredness levels, stress levels and mental health? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=385.44s)]
*  So this is my first time here in Gaza. We are a group of five UK surgeons who actually we are [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=392.64s)]
*  four surgeons and one anesthetist and we are trying to alternate especially now to try to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=406.32s)]
*  relieve each of us from the pressure and the other things we've started being to feel this [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=414.72s)]
*  stress and the fatigue now. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56AFPc4MWOc&t=424.56s)]
