Video Description: A team of British doctors and nurses have pleaded for help as more casualties enter Nasser Hospital in Gaza.

Dr Tom Potokar, who is part of a group of medics working in the southern city of Khan Younis, says it is "horrific" as patients are malnourished - and children are suffering the worst.

# British surgeon working in Gaza says it is now 'a slaughterhouse'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4)
*  Khan Yunus has been the focus of some of the fiercest attacks in recent days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli air strikes and ground operations have closed in on the city, forcing thousands to flee and leaving many dead and wounded. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=9.0s)]
*  The Nasser Hospital is the largest in the city. It is also one of the only hospitals still functioning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=19.0s)]
*  A team of British doctors and surgeons is now working there. They are specialists in plastic surgery and orthopedics. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=26.0s)]
*  Our team in Gaza spent a few days filming with them this week. They're also sending out regular video updates. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=34.0s)]
*  I'm standing on the balcony of the EMT accommodation and a really large bomb has just gone off not far to the east of us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=41.0s)]
*  And the ambulances here have just readied themselves to go off and pick up who knows how many casualties. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=55.0s)]
*  So I think we've got a lot of work heading our way. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=64.0s)]
*  This is the Burns Unit at Nasser. They're just walking through. It used to be the Burns Unit at Nasser. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=69.0s)]
*  Part of the Nasser Hospital has been hit and damaged by Israeli missiles. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=81.0s)]
*  This was the Burns Unit, one of the busiest parts of the hospital. It is out of action now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=87.0s)]
*  But that's the damage. Yeah, I'm not going to go too far into this, but wow. That's amazing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=94.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=110.0s)]
*  This baby has painful burns on her chest and back. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=115.0s)]
*  Another lies silent on the stretcher, not moving and only able to see out of one eye. She has shrapnel wounds to her face and body. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=125.0s)]
*  Children are suffering the worst. So she's had a burn? Yes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=136.0s)]
*  The lack of food and water has made them weak and more vulnerable to their injuries. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=140.0s)]
*  The operating theaters can sometimes feel like a bubble of quiet and calm from the war outside, but the patients are almost all suffering blast wounds. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=151.0s)]
*  But in the hospital's emergency unit, it's chaos. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=161.0s)]
*  Many of the survivors will need to be transferred upstairs into the care of the British doctors for reconstructive surgery. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=166.0s)]
*  So this is a young man that came in yesterday into the emergency department with his brother after an explosive blast. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=174.0s)]
*  Dr Tom Patoko was working in the European hospital near Carnunus before they were evacuated in a hurry last week. Air strikes were hitting the compound. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=182.0s)]
*  He is now in the Amal hospital close to Nasser, working again and prepping for surgery. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=195.0s)]
*  The woman on the operating table is badly injured. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=209.0s)]
*  Her husband and children were all killed. She doesn't know yet. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=216.0s)]
*  What can you say? I mean, it's horrific. Gaza has become a slaughterhouse. That's what it is, a slaughterhouse. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=223.0s)]
*  Do something. Stop talking and do something. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=235.0s)]
*  Tom Patoko was last in Gaza shortly after October the 7th. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=241.0s)]
*  Returning after 19 months of war, he's seen a dramatic change in Gaza. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=245.0s)]
*  The difference this time is because of the blockade, there's so little stuff getting in. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=252.0s)]
*  There's no food getting in so people are starving. There's very little medical supplies coming in. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=259.0s)]
*  But also the other very noticeable thing is the massive extent of destruction. I mean, Carnunus looks like Stalingrad. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=265.0s)]
*  This is our living quarters. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=275.0s)]
*  This is where they sleep and relax during the few hours that they have off shift. Camp beds together in one room. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=287.0s)]
*  Food is a single ready meal a day of just 400 calories. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=297.0s)]
*  They sometimes have to reuse tea bags. A cup of good coffee is a small luxury. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=306.0s)]
*  The blockade affects everyone. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=319.0s)]
*  Evening bombing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=327.0s)]
*  By Monday evening, the IDF declared combat zone was only a few streets from NASA Hospital. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=334.0s)]
*  A drone flew low overhead. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=343.0s)]
*  An evacuation order for most of Carnunus went out today, which meant that we lost several members of the team. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=350.0s)]
*  My anaesthetic nurse and Graham's orthopedic colleague had to leave us mid-case to go and evacuate their families to an area of safety. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=358.0s)]
*  It's quite hard to be. These are people just like you and me. They have the homes, the families, they live normal lives. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=370.0s)]
*  Many are very impressive people. And without notice, they have to pick up a grab bag and leave. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=378.0s)]
*  And they sleep on the streets, look for food, look for water, live in shelter. But, turn up for a welcome show. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=387.0s)]
*  With the Israeli military operation getting closer, the doctors are also ready to evacuate at short notice. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=398.0s)]
*  The team have put my instruments in one position for me so that if we do get evacuated, I can grab them. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=405.0s)]
*  So they've over wrapped a tray of single item plastics. You can see that they've put a bag out there for me with my name on it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=413.0s)]
*  But this is the kit that they think I should be taking with me if we do get evacuated. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=423.0s)]
*  Nasser Hospital has the last remaining ICU department in the whole of southern Gaza. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=429.0s)]
*  If it has to be evacuated, then the remaining temporary field hospitals would likely be overwhelmed and unable to cope. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=435.0s)]
*  Alistair Bunkle, Sky News, in Jerusalem. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwIawDaI8k4&t=445.0s)]
