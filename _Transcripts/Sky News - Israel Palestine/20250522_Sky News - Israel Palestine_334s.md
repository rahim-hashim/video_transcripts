# Miliband: 'Absolutely abominable level of suffering inside Gaza'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw)
*  I think the most important thing at the moment is that every hour counts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's an absolutely abominable level of suffering inside Gaza, and it's a preventable level [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=4.8s)]
*  of suffering. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=12.6s)]
*  I think that the circumstances on the ground, we're an international humanitarian agency, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  we have teams on the ground, we have partners on the ground, but they can't do their job. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=18.66s)]
*  And what's more, they report out of absolutely dire circumstances that bring a human dimension [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=23.2s)]
*  to the UN statistics that no doubt you've heard, which is that one in five of the population, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=30.32s)]
*  so four, 500,000 people, face famine. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  And this is a judgment from an independent assessment of the situation on the ground. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  So what counts now is not language, it's actions to address this highly preventable situation, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=47.08s)]
*  which at the moment is afflicting over two million people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=56.56s)]
*  David, what action do you think needs to now be taken? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=59.28s)]
*  Because I mean, I was speaking to one of the presidents of Oxfam on the program yesterday [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=63.44s)]
*  who said that, frankly, the arms that the UK is selling to Israel, that needs to stop [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=68.52s)]
*  immediately. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=74.92s)]
*  Well, the action that I'm concerned about is action to save lives. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=76.76s)]
*  Now we have 27 pallets, IRC pallets of medicines and nutritional supplements waiting to come [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  in. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=91.44s)]
*  So what needs to happen now is the opening of the crossings to humanitarian goods and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=92.44s)]
*  also to commercial goods. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=96.64s)]
*  We know that in the six weeks of the ceasefire, there was significant improvement in the living [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=98.86s)]
*  conditions of people inside Gaza. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=104.32s)]
*  It wasn't the full solution by any manner of means. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  When the crossings were closed 11 weeks ago, it started the descent into the kind of hell [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=110.44s)]
*  that you're reporting at the moment. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=115.88s)]
*  And so the absolute priority, and I can confirm this from conversations with our own teams [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=118.52s)]
*  on the ground, lives are at stake now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=123.44s)]
*  Tom Fletcher, the UN coordinator, the man who's in charge of global humanitarian efforts, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=126.08s)]
*  said that 14,000 children's lives are on the line. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=134.28s)]
*  I haven't got that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=137.32s)]
*  I can't give you that overall picture. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  I can give you the specifics from what our teams are seeing, and they confirm absolutely [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=141.64s)]
*  dire needs. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=146.44s)]
*  And so what counts now is opening up those crossings so that the material gets in there, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  but also the water supplies, the electricity, to make sure that these people are able to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=153.56s)]
*  stay alive and establish some degree of sustainability. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  60,000 dead. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  As you say, Tom Fletcher says that in the next 48 hours or so, if that much needed aid [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=165.0s)]
*  doesn't enter Gaza, we could see the death of 40,000 children. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=169.88s)]
*  You and I spoke about a year ago, and at that time you were warning about the risk of famine [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  and you were urging global leaders to do more. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=180.12s)]
*  When I put that to Israeli officials, when I say David Miliband is saying this, Cindy [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=184.28s)]
*  McCain is saying this, Tom Fletcher is saying this, they dismiss it and say, well, they [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  don't have the facts on the ground and there is sufficient aid getting into Gaza, even [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  though we know that from about the end of February through to this period now, the people [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  of Gaza have not received much needed aid and that there is a blockade. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, you're right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  And the facts that I'm giving you from the ground are right as well. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=211.72s)]
*  And the proof of that is that when the aid supplies started coming in, the human conditions [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=216.6s)]
*  improved. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=220.44s)]
*  Of course, there's another point here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=221.44s)]
*  The concern about looting and diversion of aid, the more aid you get in, the less valuable [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=222.72s)]
*  each item of aid is. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=227.4s)]
*  So we're stuck in the most vicious of vicious circles at the moment. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=229.32s)]
*  We need to get out of it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=233.8s)]
*  That's the critical thing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=235.24s)]
*  And the fact that when there was the ceasefire for six weeks, it did deliver improvements. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=236.24s)]
*  When the flow of aid was stopped because the ceasefire was over and then added to the curtailment [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  of aid flows, as well as commercial flows, we've had the kind of needs skyrocketing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=248.48s)]
*  Malnutrition is skyrocketing for a very simple reason. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=254.44s)]
*  There isn't food to feed people. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=257.44s)]
*  We're 20 months into this conflict. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=259.08s)]
*  You and I have had multiple conversations about the situation on the ground. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=261.28s)]
*  You said that while it's fine that these words of condemnation are now coming out of Western [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=265.76000000000005s)]
*  capitals and that we need to now do more on the ground, what exactly do you expect from [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  Western leaders, the global community, to do? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=280.56s)]
*  What kind of pressure should they be putting, especially allies of Israel, on Israel so [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  they act now? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=288.36s)]
*  I think that there's more and more unanimity coming out. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=290.32000000000005s)]
*  And that's important because you're hearing it from across the Arab world, you're hearing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=294.12s)]
*  it from Europeans, you're also hearing it from some parts of the Trump administration [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=298.0s)]
*  as well. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=302.92s)]
*  There is no solution to this problem that involves immiserating the people of Gaza in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=303.92s)]
*  the way that they're being immiserated at the moment. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=308.8s)]
*  It's an abominable level of suffering. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=310.8s)]
*  And what we need to see is that the admission by the Israeli government that some supplies [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=314.32s)]
*  are needed turned into a flood of supplies, because we've got to make up for lost ground. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=319.92s)]
*  That's the truth about the situation on the ground at the moment. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  David Miliband, always grateful for your time. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=331.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Yelda. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qBtYRKqmw&t=332.64000000000004s)]
