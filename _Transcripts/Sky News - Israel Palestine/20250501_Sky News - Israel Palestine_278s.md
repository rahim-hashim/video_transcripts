Video Description: The first Gazan children to be treated in the UK since the conflict between Israel and Hamas began have arrived in London.

Sky News followed five-year-old Ghena and 12-year-old Rama as they travelled to receive urgent medical care for long-standing conditions unrelated to the war.

A few children from Gaza have benefited from medical evacuations, but none have come to the UK.

In March, the Israelis signed a deal with Jordan which could allow 2,000 children to leave the enclave for treatment of war injuries, and conditions like cancer. However, just 29 were allowed out.

Israel was contacted for comment about this story but did not respond to the request.

# Gazan children arrive in UK for urgent medical care | Israel-Hamas War
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s)
*  It was a welcome party of sorts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=0.0s)]
*  Flowers, a few presents and a sense of relief. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=3.0s)]
*  Because two children in urgent need of medical treatment [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=7.0s)]
*  would soon arrive from overseas. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=11.0s)]
*  The difficult bit is where they're from. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=13.0s)]
*  There aren't many people here to welcome the children, to greet them. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=16.0s)]
*  And I think that says something, which I think it says a lot, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=20.0s)]
*  about how sensitive this is. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=24.0s)]
*  Through security and into the light, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=28.0s)]
*  these are the first children from Gaza with permission [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=31.0s)]
*  to enter Britain for medical care. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=34.0s)]
*  Five-year-old Geina needs immediate treatment, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=37.0s)]
*  or she'll lose her left eye. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=40.0s)]
*  Rama is weak and struggles to hold down her food. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=43.0s)]
*  Doctors say the 12-year-old needs an operation on her bowel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=47.0s)]
*  For her mother, it's difficult to believe they've been selected for this, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=52.0s)]
*  in Gaza there are thousands of children in need. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=56.0s)]
*  What's going through your mind? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=60.0s)]
*  It's taken 17 months to make this happen. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=76.0s)]
*  A small group of volunteers have raised the money [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=79.0s)]
*  and fought and argued for the visas. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=83.0s)]
*  It's been a very long journey. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=86.0s)]
*  There have been many times where we didn't think we would be here [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=89.0s)]
*  as we are now. It's overwhelming for everyone, I think. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=92.0s)]
*  Displaced by the fighting, the girls were living in tents [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=97.0s)]
*  with little food, no medicine, no way to keep themselves clean. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=101.0s)]
*  These images of the place where 12-year-old Rama was forced to live. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=106.0s)]
*  Her condition was so unstable, her family couldn't move her, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=111.0s)]
*  even when the bombing came close. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=115.0s)]
*  Our team met them in Egypt the day before they flew to the UK. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=125.0s)]
*  When we return to Gaza, you will need to be treated. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=141.0s)]
*  You will need to be treated and then... [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=144.0s)]
*  The pain is not just a physical thing. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=148.0s)]
*  Rama is worried about her sisters, Hala and Lamis. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=151.0s)]
*  They were injured when a tank shell hit the family home. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=155.0s)]
*  Both women had been living in the ruins. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=159.0s)]
*  As the pressure builds on her optic nerve, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=172.0s)]
*  five-year-old Geina needs specialist care, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=175.0s)]
*  but that's no longer available in Gaza. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=178.0s)]
*  The hospital where she went for treatment has been destroyed. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=181.0s)]
*  Mother Hanin knows they've been fortunate, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=189.0s)]
*  but she also feels guilty. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=192.0s)]
*  The Israelis have only permitted a small number of children [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=194.0s)]
*  to leave for treatment. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=198.0s)]
*  I'm happy and I feel mixed feelings. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=201.0s)]
*  There's sadness, joy and sadness. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=205.0s)]
*  I'm also sad for the children in Gaza. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=208.0s)]
*  There are many injured and many travelling. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=211.0s)]
*  I hope they can leave for treatment and find a chance to be treated. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=214.0s)]
*  Because they all care about us. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=218.0s)]
*  A small group of volunteers are responsible for this, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=223.0s)]
*  organising treatment and the temporary visas to enter Britain. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=226.0s)]
*  But the process has proven painfully slow. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=230.0s)]
*  I'm trying to understand why it has taken so long. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=234.0s)]
*  It's privately funded, no cost to the taxpayer. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=238.0s)]
*  I don't know, but I think for us we just kept going [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=241.0s)]
*  because at the end of this pathway are children who need urgent medical care [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=246.0s)]
*  and I can't think of anything more important to spend your time trying to improve. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=252.0s)]
*  These volunteers call themselves nobodies. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=258.0s)]
*  But they've taken an interest and given two children from Gaza a chance. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=261.0s)]
*  And there's a list of other children they can save, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=267.0s)]
*  but they can't do it all on their own. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=270.0s)]
*  John Sparks, Sky News, Heathrow. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kJpz1gg1s&t=274.0s)]
