# Sky investigates full timeline of IDF's attack on Gaza aid workers
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E)
*  This is the final footage filmed by Medek in Gaza, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=0.0s)]
*  gunned down and killed by Israeli forces on March 23rd, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  along with more than a dozen of his colleagues. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=8.24s)]
*  They were on their way to help another emergency crew [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=10.8s)]
*  wounded in an earlier Israeli attack. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=13.4s)]
*  The man who filmed the video was Rifat Radwan. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=16.12s)]
*  His body was found in a shallow grave. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=18.64s)]
*  His phone, with the footage detailing the last minutes [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=21.44s)]
*  of his life, was still in his pocket. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=24.72s)]
*  And that footage has blown up the IDF's initial narrative [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=27.52s)]
*  about the killings. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=31.12s)]
*  So many questions. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=32.12s)]
*  Why the murder? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=34.56s)]
*  They were wearing their heels. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=35.6s)]
*  The lights were on. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=37.16s)]
*  The world wants answers. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=38.64s)]
*  What exactly happened here? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  And will anyone be held accountable? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=42.12s)]
*  Using visual evidence, audio analysis, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=44.6s)]
*  and our interviews with family members, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=47.64s)]
*  a survivor, colleagues, doctors and forensic specialists, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=49.72s)]
*  we've pieced together the most comprehensive timeline so far [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=52.96s)]
*  of what happened on the morning of March 23rd. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=57.12s)]
*  From 3.52 when the first ambulance was dispatched [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  onto 5.08 when the attack began, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=63.48s)]
*  and then 7.25 when the last of the communication [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=66.44s)]
*  with first responders was lost. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=70.2s)]
*  It all builds a clearer picture of the Israeli military's attack [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=72.48s)]
*  and burial of what was clearly marked emergency vehicles. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=76.52s)]
*  Now that their families and colleagues want accountability [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=80.88s)]
*  and justice for their deaths. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss-xFx0496E&t=84.36s)]
