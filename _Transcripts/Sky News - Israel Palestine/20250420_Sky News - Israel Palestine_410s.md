# Israeli military fires deputy commander as it releases findings into deadly attack on aid workers
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU)
*  Good afternoon. We begin with breaking news. An Israeli military investigation into the killings of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza last month has resulted in a deputy commander being fired after what it described as professional failures. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=0.0s)]
*  The IDF claimed there was no attempt to conceal the event and that there had been breaches of orders and a failure to fully report the incident. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=16.0s)]
*  I'm going to read you the IDF's statement now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=25.0s)]
*  Including using ambulances to transport terrorists and weapons. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=55.0s)]
*  The examination found no evidence to support claims of execution or that any of the deceased were bound before or after the shooting. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=59.0s)]
*  Such claims are blood libels and false accusations against IDF soldiers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=69.0s)]
*  On the night of the incident, March 23rd, 2025, the troops were conducting a vital mission aimed at targeting terrorists. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=74.0s)]
*  Throughout the operation, vehicles and ambulances moved along the route without obstruction since the forces did not perceive any threat posed by them. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=83.0s)]
*  The forces also apprehended two pedestrians who raised suspicion and released them subsequently. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=92.0s)]
*  This indicates that the troops did not engage in indiscriminate fire but remained alert to respond to real threats identified by them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=99.0s)]
*  The first incident, the troops fired at a vehicle identified as a Hamas vehicle. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=108.0s)]
*  Following this, the troops remained on high alert for further potential threats. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=114.0s)]
*  The second incident, approximately an hour later, the troops opened fire on suspects emerging from a fire truck and ambulances very close to the area in which the troops were operating after perceiving an immediate and tangible threat. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=119.0s)]
*  Supporting surveillance had reported five vehicles approaching rapidly and stopping near the troops with passengers quickly disembarking. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=134.0s)]
*  The IDF says the deputy battalion commander assessed the vehicles as employed by Hamas forces who arrived to assist the first vehicles passengers. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=143.0s)]
*  Under this impression and sense of threat, he ordered to open fire. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=153.0s)]
*  Fifteen Palestinians were killed, six of whom were identified in a retrospective examination as Hamas terrorists. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=159.0s)]
*  Due to poor night visibility, the deputy commander did not initially recognize the vehicles as ambulances. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=167.0s)]
*  Only later, after approaching the vehicles and scanning them, was it discovered that these were indeed rescue teams. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=174.0s)]
*  The third incident, about 15 minutes later, the IDF says troops fired at a Palestinian UN vehicle due to operational errors in breach of regulations. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=181.0s)]
*  The troops commander initially reported the event and additional details emerged later in the examination. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=193.0s)]
*  The IDF says at dawn it was decided to gather and cover the bodies to prevent further harm and clear the vehicles from the route in preparation for civilian evacuation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=201.0s)]
*  The body removal and vehicle crushing were carried out by field commanders. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=212.0s)]
*  The examination concluded that removing the bodies was reasonable under the circumstances, but the decision to crush the vehicles was wrong. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=217.0s)]
*  In general, there was no attempt to conceal the event, which was discussed with international organizations and the UN, including coordination for the removal of bodies. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=226.0s)]
*  The examination determined that the fire in the first two incidents resulted from an operational misunderstanding by the troops, who believed they faced a tangible threat from enemy forces. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=237.0s)]
*  The third incident involved a breach of orders during a combat setting. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=250.0s)]
*  In its conclusion of the examination process, the chief of the general staff emphasized the commitment to continuing the fight against Hamas while upholding IDF values, operational discipline and orders. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=256.0s)]
*  He affirmed that the Golani reconnaissance battalion is a professional and high quality battalion that has been operating with great distinction for a year and a half. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=271.0s)]
*  Alongside this, the examination identified several professional failures, breaches of orders and the failure to fully report the incident. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=280.0s)]
*  The chief of the general staff and the commanding officer of the Southern Command accepted the examination's findings. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=291.0s)]
*  The chief of the general staff and the Southern Command recommended the following command measures. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=298.0s)]
*  The commanding officer of the 14th Brigade will receive a reprimand, which will be recorded in his personal file, for his overall responsibility for the incident, including the procedure of combat and management of the scene afterward. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=307.0s)]
*  The statement from the IDF goes on to say that the deputy commander of the Golani reconnaissance battalion will be dismissed from his position due to his responsibilities as the field commander in this incident and for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=323.0s)]
*  The commanders emphasize that the deputy commander of the Golani reconnaissance battalion is a highly respected officer whose military service and personal story reflect a spirit of combat, volunteerism and great dedication. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=343.0s)]
*  Following October 7th, he returned from abroad to serve in reserve duty, continued to operate in Gaza until he was injured in the combat and returned to service after his recovery. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=358.0s)]
*  Over the past six months, he was on active reserve duty and served as the battalion's deputy commander. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=369.0s)]
*  Now the statement goes on to say the IDF regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=376.0s)]
*  The examination process also serves as part of an ongoing effort to learn from operational incidents and reduce the likelihood of similar occurrences in the future. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=384.0s)]
*  Existing protocols have been clarified and reinforced, emphasizing the need for heightened caution when operating near rescue forces and medical personnel, even in high-intensity combat zones. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZCJ1L1tLU&t=395.0s)]
