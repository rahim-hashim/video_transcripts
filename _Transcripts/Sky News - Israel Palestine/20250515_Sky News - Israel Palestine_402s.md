# Surgeon who worked in Gaza discusses latest Israeli strikes
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA)
*  Great to have you with us today, Dr. Sidwell. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=0.0s)]
*  I know that you left Gaza on the 1st of April, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  but what are your friends telling you [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=5.28s)]
*  about what happened in yesterday's strikes? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=7.24s)]
*  Morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=9.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, I worked at European Hospital a year ago in Gaza, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=11.76s)]
*  actually. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=14.56s)]
*  And then when I was back this time, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=14.96s)]
*  I worked at Nasser, which was also bombed yesterday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=16.4s)]
*  Both were hit. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=19.36s)]
*  So there was a photojournalist who [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=21.68s)]
*  had been nearly killed in an Israeli airstrike [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=25.04s)]
*  on his tent, the media tent just outside of Nasser Hospital, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=27.88s)]
*  where actually I used to hang out with the journalists there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=32.64s)]
*  He was killed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=35.32s)]
*  He was the target of the attack. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=36.04s)]
*  And then another patient was killed in the strike on Nasser. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=37.32s)]
*  Just so people understand, even if he was in Hamas, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=41.44s)]
*  you don't just get to kill him in a hospital. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=44.2s)]
*  But it doesn't even seem like he was in Hamas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=46.04s)]
*  His only crime seems to have been documenting the October 7th [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=48.92s)]
*  Hamas attacks on Israel. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=51.72s)]
*  But yeah, so they bombed this hospital in Nasser [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  for the second time in less than two months [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=57.56s)]
*  to kill someone that they don't like. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  The first time that they did it, they killed one of my patients, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=62.52s)]
*  Ibrahim Barhum, a 16-year-old boy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=65.0s)]
*  And this time, they killed this photojournalist [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=67.88s)]
*  and another patient who, unfortunately, I [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=69.76s)]
*  don't know anything about. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=71.44s)]
*  At European Hospital, there were multiple airstrikes, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=73.36s)]
*  somewhere between 9 and 12. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=76.84s)]
*  It's not really clear. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=78.18s)]
*  And then there were two more the next day [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=79.72s)]
*  on the workers who were cleaning up the rubble, actually. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=81.48s)]
*  The claim, like you said, was that the Israelis were [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=84.64s)]
*  attacking an underground Hamas command center. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=87.12s)]
*  And the Israelis actually released a video, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  which I think you might have been playing just a moment ago. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=91.08s)]
*  They released a video purportedly showing this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=94.08s)]
*  Well, Sky News itself actually did an investigation about this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=96.56s)]
*  It's on your website, showing that not only does the video not [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=99.56s)]
*  even show European Hospital, but that the reported, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=103.0s)]
*  what the Israelis claim was terror infrastructure [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=107.12s)]
*  underneath the hospital, which again, they weren't even [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=109.76s)]
*  looking at the hospital in that video, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  were just water drainage ditches. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=114.36000000000001s)]
*  So these kinds of claims are nonsensical. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=116.24s)]
*  They always are. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=119.32s)]
*  And these attacks on hospitals are just attacks on hospitals. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=120.24s)]
*  That's really all they are. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=123.16s)]
*  And they're killing patients. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  They're killing health care workers. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=125.6s)]
*  It's got to stop. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  It really has to stop. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=128.84s)]
*  And Dr. Sidwell, I know that you were at the NASA hospital [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=130.84s)]
*  on the 23rd of March when there was a strike then. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=133.88s)]
*  Take me back to that day. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=139.16s)]
*  What did you see? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=141.12s)]
*  What did you hear? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=142.22s)]
*  What was it like? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=143.72s)]
*  That day was five days after the resumption [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=147.0s)]
*  of the really widespread bombardment of the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=150.96s)]
*  And the last operation that I had done the day [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=154.68s)]
*  the bombardment restarted was a 16-year-old boy named Ibrahim, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  whom I just mentioned, Ibrahim Barhum. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=161.4s)]
*  Nice kid, 16 years old, doing well in school, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=164.12s)]
*  had a loving family. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=167.96s)]
*  And on the 23rd, he was ready to go home. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=169.26s)]
*  Well, right after it was Ramadan during that time, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=173.2s)]
*  and Muslims, they'd eat an evening meal called iftar. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  So after they had had iftar, I went down, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=182.11999999999998s)]
*  and I was going to change Ibrahim's dressings. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=185.76s)]
*  His room was on the second floor of the hospital. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=187.76s)]
*  And our living quarters were on the fourth floor. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  So I walked out of the fourth floor past the ICU. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=192.72s)]
*  And I was pulled into the ICU to look at another patient whom [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=195.32s)]
*  I'd never met before. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=198.2s)]
*  I spent about 10 minutes working that patient up. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=199.64s)]
*  And then I said, look, this guy needs [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=201.92s)]
*  to go to the operating room. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to go down and change Ibrahim's dressings. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  You guys get this kid into the OR, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=207.28s)]
*  because this is the patient in the ICU was bleeding badly. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=208.88s)]
*  And by the time I've changed Ibrahim's dressings, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=211.6s)]
*  I'm going to come back up and we'll take care [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=214.11999999999998s)]
*  of this guy in the ICU. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=215.88s)]
*  As I walked out of the ICU, Ibrahim's room exploded. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  So if it had happened literally two minutes later, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=220.72s)]
*  I would have been standing right next to him when he was killed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=222.76s)]
*  I'm sure I would have been killed too. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=225.56s)]
*  And again, the reason that they decided [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=227.92s)]
*  to blow up this hospital room was [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=230.52s)]
*  to kill a wounded person in Hamas named Ibrahim, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  named Ismail, by whom I believe. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=235.4s)]
*  And because they're from the same extended family, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=237.32000000000002s)]
*  they were kind of distant cousins [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=239.44s)]
*  from what I understand. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=240.78s)]
*  The nurses had put them into the same room [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=241.96s)]
*  just to make family visits easier. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  And so Ibrahim had to suffer for that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  Now, I've never had a patient blown up and then blown up [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=248.8s)]
*  again in his hospital bed. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=253.36s)]
*  That's pretty unusual. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=254.8s)]
*  But I have to be honest, it was pretty scary [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=257.0s)]
*  to be in a hospital that was being bombarded. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=259.88s)]
*  The Palestinians did everything they could to keep us safe. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=263.2s)]
*  They kind of shoved us over to what [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=265.52s)]
*  they thought was the safest area of the hospital [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=267.52s)]
*  to try and keep us safe. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=270.2s)]
*  But you can't. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=271.28s)]
*  How are you going to keep people safe if the hospital itself [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=272.4s)]
*  is being bombed? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=274.96s)]
*  I walked through the, I actually think [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=277.2s)]
*  the footage that I shot was shown on Sky News back then. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  I walked through the destroyed men's surgical ward. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=283.12s)]
*  It just looks like what happens when [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=285.64s)]
*  you blow up a surgical ward. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=287.18s)]
*  Mangled beds everywhere. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=288.7s)]
*  There's some blood splattered on the wall. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=290.14s)]
*  All the lighting and everything is destroyed. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=292.38s)]
*  There's a giant hole in the hole of the hospital [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=294.61999999999995s)]
*  where the missile came through. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=297.34s)]
*  And there's two dead bodies. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=299.73999999999995s)]
*  Goodness me. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=302.85999999999996s)]
*  Look, Hamas say that, sorry, Israel and the military [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=304.62s)]
*  there say that actually they're going to continue [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=310.02s)]
*  until they destroy Hamas. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=314.5s)]
*  What do you think that means for the patients [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=317.3s)]
*  at these hospitals? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=321.1s)]
*  I have to be honest. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=325.22s)]
*  I think it means Gaza is just going to be destroyed. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=326.18s)]
*  And I think that includes the patients in the hospitals. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=328.42s)]
*  If destroying Hamas requires dropping 12 bombs [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=332.62s)]
*  on one small hospital, European hospital is a 200 bed facility. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=338.22s)]
*  It's not big. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  If it requires dropping 12 bombs on them [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=343.5s)]
*  and then releasing a video that doesn't even [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=346.36s)]
*  show the building that you're purporting to bomb, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=348.92s)]
*  I think that shows pretty clearly. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=352.24s)]
*  You're just bombing the hospital to bomb the hospital. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=353.88s)]
*  It's got nothing to do with fighting Hamas. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  So if the Hamas thing is just an excuse to destroy all of Gaza, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=358.0s)]
*  then I think it means they're going [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  to continue destroying all of Gaza like they have. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=363.72s)]
*  With the full support of my government, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=366.52000000000004s)]
*  I should point out that's the most important reason for me [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=368.24s)]
*  to be involved in this. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=370.76s)]
*  And so I think it means the patients are [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=372.6s)]
*  going to continue suffering. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=374.64s)]
*  And just to keep in mind, half of Gaza is children. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=375.84s)]
*  They're the ones that are suffering the most, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  just like the ones in India and Kashmir that you just showed. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=380.96s)]
*  India, Pakistan, Kashmir. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=384.23999999999995s)]
*  Dr. Simmel, thank you so much for your time. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  We really do appreciate it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jDYt4tQwA&t=389.03999999999996s)]
