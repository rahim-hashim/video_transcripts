# British surgeon compares Gaza to 'killing fields'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsOmNmLUs3Y)
*  If Cambodia was the killing fields then Gaza now is the slaughterhouse. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsOmNmLUs3Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Well it's another day of devastation here in Gaza. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsOmNmLUs3Y&t=9.0s)]
*  Stories coming from the north absolutely horrific, particularly around the Indonesian hospital [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsOmNmLUs3Y&t=13.0s)]
*  but also in the Al Moase area this morning where 36 people were killed in the so-called safe zone. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsOmNmLUs3Y&t=20.0s)]
*  We've been operating all morning so far, all for explosive injuries. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsOmNmLUs3Y&t=29.0s)]
*  One young woman with leg fracture and shoulder fracture and a large wound on her buttock [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsOmNmLUs3Y&t=37.0s)]
*  who came in yesterday and is not yet aware that everyone in her family was killed in the onslaught. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsOmNmLUs3Y&t=46.0s)]
*  It's difficult to describe in words what's happening here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsOmNmLUs3Y&t=54.0s)]
*  The constant sound of bombardment, jets overhead. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsOmNmLUs3Y&t=61.0s)]
