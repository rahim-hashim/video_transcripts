# At least 60 killed in overnight airstrikes on Gaza, medics say
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4)
*  Some of the airstrikes in Gaza are so enormous now, they can be seen from miles away. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=0.0s)]
*  This was northern Gaza this morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=5.2s)]
*  Closer to the impact, there was panic. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  And who could be expected to survive this? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=18.2s)]
*  Anyone close by wouldn't have stood a chance. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=21.2s)]
*  This was a medical clinic. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=24.4s)]
*  It's now barely standing and certainly cannot function again. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=27.4s)]
*  A mosque close by was also hit. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=31.4s)]
*  Carefully, the paramedics carry the dead down to the street below. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=36.4s)]
*  Down there, a scorched leg blown off in the blast is wrapped into the brown blanket. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=40.4s)]
*  And they search through the debris for more body parts. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=46.4s)]
*  In Gaza, there is little dignity left now in life or death. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=49.6s)]
*  13 people were killed here, health officials say. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  In all, more than 100 have been killed across Gaza today alone. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=61.6s)]
*  You see what's happened. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=72.6s)]
*  There is no resistance here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=74.6s)]
*  There is none of that here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=76.8s)]
*  This is a clinic that provides treatment for those who need it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=78.8s)]
*  There was only a group of ill and injured people willing to get treated. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=83.8s)]
*  We were surprised by the Israeli airstrike that in one moment covered us in rubble. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=87.8s)]
*  People died and some lived. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=92.8s)]
*  Most of the people in this square around me were killed. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=94.8s)]
*  I don't think any of them are alive. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=97.8s)]
*  They hoped Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East this week would fight for the dead. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=100.8s)]
*  Would finally bring them some respite. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=106.0s)]
*  That's looking unlikely now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=109.0s)]
*  Instead, Israel's military operations are getting even more intense. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=115.0s)]
*  The Palestinian death toll in 19 months of war, today, past 53,000. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=122.0s)]
*  Alistair Bunkle, Sky News, in Jerusalem. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmP0Tps6I4&t=129.0s)]
