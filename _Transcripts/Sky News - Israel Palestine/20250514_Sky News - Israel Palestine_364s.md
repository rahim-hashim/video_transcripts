# 'We were thrown on the floor': Gaza hospital workers describe moment Israeli missiles hit
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M)
*  Dr Tom Potokar is a British surgeon and the director of Interburns and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=0.0s)]
*  Milena Chi is an intensive care specialist at the European Hospital in Gaza [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=5.0s)]
*  which was hit yesterday in those Israeli airstrikes. Both joining us now from the hospital in Kain Yunis. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=9.0s)]
*  Good to have you with us. Tom, first and foremost, just tell us what happened in those moments, if you will. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=14.0s)]
*  Yeah, so last night we'd just finished operating. Milena was in the intensive care unit. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=20.0s)]
*  I'd gone back to the residence and then there was one extremely loud explosion followed very, very rapidly by a number of others. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=27.0s)]
*  I understand there was nine. I couldn't count. But yeah, certainly there seemed to be quite a few. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=37.0s)]
*  Rushed outside to see a huge crater in the entrance to the hospital. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=43.0s)]
*  Quite a few wounded lying around. Quite a lot of destruction to the hospital. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=49.0s)]
*  Inside, rubble on the floor, shrapnel, bits of ceiling coming down, water leaking from the roofs and, you know, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=55.0s)]
*  large cracks in the actual walls of the hospital building as well. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=64.0s)]
*  Milena, just talk to us about your experience in that moment. What was happening for you? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=69.0s)]
*  I was in intensive care at this moment looking after a patient and there was a very strong and loud blast and noise. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=74.0s)]
*  And we could not stand on our feet, so we were thrown on the floor. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=82.0s)]
*  The explosion happened just probably two meters away from the wall of the critical care. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=87.0s)]
*  So there were some panels which fell from the ceiling and quite a lot of dust. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=94.0s)]
*  It's a very shattering experience. It's quite scary and even my colleagues are very used to it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=102.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, they were very scared and shocked. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=108.0s)]
*  Maybe it is two more. It is three more at the moment. So this is my experience. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=112.0s)]
*  Just, if you will, how many people were killed and injured in this strike at the hospital where you were? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=124.0s)]
*  Sorry, there were two more, so we couldn't hear you. Two more. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=130.0s)]
*  Sorry, there's quite a few blocks going on. Could you repeat that? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=133.0s)]
*  Just, if you will, how many people were killed and injured in these strikes that took place that you both experienced? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=136.0s)]
*  So there was reported 28 killed and somewhere in the region. I don't think there's precise details about the number of injured. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=144.0s)]
*  Somewhere between 50 and 70, from what I understand. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=153.0s)]
*  The patients were not admitted, I think one or two here, but they were taken straight away to other hospitals because obviously people were extremely frightened. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=157.0s)]
*  A lot of the staff were trying to flee, as were quite a lot of the patients, and nobody knew if there was going to be further strikes. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=167.0s)]
*  So they didn't want to be admitting patients. So the patients and also the entrance and everything was blocked for ambulances. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=175.0s)]
*  So the ambulances on the other side immediately took patients to other facilities. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=181.0s)]
*  What impact, Tom, has this had on the capacity for you guys to operate and provide healthcare provision and services? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=187.0s)]
*  Well, at the moment the hospital is barely functional. There are still patients in the hospital, but the water supply has been affected, so there's no water on the intensive care unit. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=197.0s)]
*  The operating theatre was right outside, was damaged with a lot of rubble on the floor and outside the theatre. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=210.0s)]
*  The drainage has been affected and the sewerage, etc. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=218.0s)]
*  So it needs some structural repairs for those things, which will take some time. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=224.0s)]
*  So there's not been any operating happening this morning. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=231.0s)]
*  And obviously everyone's doing the best they can to look after the patients. Those that can be discharged have been discharged. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=235.0s)]
*  We talk about the patients. Milena, if you will, just talk to us about who is in your care at the moment and the care that you're having to provide. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=242.0s)]
*  What injuries are you having to treat at the moment? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=250.0s)]
*  Intensive care is full at the moment. I have 11 patients, three of them are children. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=253.0s)]
*  The majority of the patients that we look after have blast injuries to different areas of their body. So they are injuries secondary to explosions. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=259.0s)]
*  And to what degree are you able to provide care? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=272.0s)]
*  You're thinking of the fact that there has been that aid embargo now on the strip since the 2nd of March. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=276.0s)]
*  The Israeli authorities not allowing aid into the territory. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=284.0s)]
*  Where are you at with regards to the medical supplies and equipment that you need to be able to look after people? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=288.0s)]
*  Gareth, there is no medical supplies whatsoever. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=295.0s)]
*  There is no tissues to wipe our hands when we wash them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=300.0s)]
*  Now there is even no water. They lack soap, cleaning materials, medications, monitors, supplies, consumables, whatever you can think about it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=304.0s)]
*  It's lacking. But I need to say that despite all that, my colleagues are absolutely amazing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=322.0s)]
*  They turn up to work every day at 8 o'clock. They are very polite. They are very considerate for their patients. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=329.0s)]
*  They do what they can. And they all fulfill their humanitarian duty the same way as we are trying to do as well. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=337.0s)]
*  Milena Chi, intensive care specialist, Dr Tom Potica, British surgeon and director of Interburns, both speaking to us from the European Hospital in Gaza. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=350.0s)]
*  Appreciate your time. Thank you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0uf5FcUu9M&t=358.0s)]
