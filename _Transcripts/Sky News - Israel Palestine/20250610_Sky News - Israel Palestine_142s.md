Video Description: Greta Thunberg has been deported from Israel after the Gaza-bound aid ship she was on was seized by the country's military.
The 22-year-old climate campaigner was one of a dozen people aboard the Madleen, which set sail from Sicily on 1 May on a mission aiming to break Israel's sea blockade of Gaza.
The boat was boarded by the Israeli military and brought to shore on Monday.

# Greta Thunberg deported from Israel after Gaza aid boat seized
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk)
*  Israel has deported the pro-Palestinian activist Greta Thunberg [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=0.0s)]
*  after she and several others on board a humanitarian aid ship [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=3.52s)]
*  destined for Gaza were intercepted at sea. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=6.88s)]
*  Israel's Foreign Ministry says the Swedish campaigner [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=9.52s)]
*  is now on a plane to Sweden via France. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Our Middle East correspondent, Alistair Bunkle, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=14.64s)]
*  has the latest from Jerusalem. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=16.48s)]
*  Greta Thunberg and some of the other activists [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=18.76s)]
*  put on a flight to Paris. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=21.52s)]
*  I think it's just taken off. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=23.88s)]
*  It looks like it's an El Al flight [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=24.84s)]
*  with the Israeli national carrier [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=26.28s)]
*  from Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport to Paris-Chardagall, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=28.68s)]
*  where she'll probably then travel back to Sweden from there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  So the Madeline, the yacht that she was on [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=36.24s)]
*  with 11 other activists, tried to break the Gaza blockade [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=39.96s)]
*  intercepted by the Israeli military [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=44.32s)]
*  around 3 a.m. yesterday morning. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=46.16s)]
*  Then there was a period of real quiet [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=49.92s)]
*  as they were towed to the port in Ashdod. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=51.72s)]
*  They arrived there late yesterday evening, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  and this deportation has happened pretty swiftly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=59.8s)]
*  Not everyone, I understand, is going immediately. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=62.279999999999994s)]
*  There were six French nationals on the yacht, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=64.96s)]
*  of which five, we understand, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=68.16s)]
*  are actually challenging that deportation, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=70.24s)]
*  and will have to go through court hearings in Israel [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=72.64s)]
*  before, presumably, they will ultimately be deported as well. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't say there's massive sympathy here [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=79.16s)]
*  for what they were trying to achieve. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=82.28s)]
*  I think, in the global opinion, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=84.84s)]
*  I mean, if we can generalize it, it's probably split. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=87.2s)]
*  Some saying that, like Israel, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=90.84s)]
*  this was more of a publicity stunt. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=93.52s)]
*  It didn't achieve anything ultimately, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  and if anything, it distracted from the reality [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=97.92s)]
*  of what's going on day to day in Gaza. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=101.4s)]
*  Others will say that the likes of Greta Thunberg, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=104.16s)]
*  in particular, given her global profile, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=107.08s)]
*  can only help keep the situation in Gaza on a global agenda, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=111.28s)]
*  and yeah, they didn't make it through the blockade, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=117.24s)]
*  but they challenged the Israelis, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=120.0s)]
*  and they highlighted the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=122.0s)]
*  So, you know, I say, internationally, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  if I can judge it, split opinion, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=128.12s)]
*  in Israel, I guess, more people were, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=130.92s)]
*  most people were against what she was trying to do [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=133.76s)]
*  and feel that it sucked up the resources [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  of the Israeli military and the Israeli government [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=138.04s)]
*  as they worked out what to do with it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufQyiutcwYk&t=140.2s)]
