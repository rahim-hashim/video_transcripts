# BREAKING: Israel attacks Iran's nuclear facilities - Iran 'responds with mass drone launch'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss)
*  Hello, very good morning. Thanks for joining us here today. Israel has launched what it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=0.0s)]
*  calls a preemptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities and other military targets. Benjamin [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=4.8s)]
*  Netanyahu promised the mission, dubbed Operation Rising Lion, would continue for as many days [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  as it takes, saying Iran's nuclear program poses a threat to Israel's very survival. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=17.48s)]
*  Well, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed a harsh punishment in retaliation [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=23.72s)]
*  for the attack, saying Israel has brought a bitter and painful fate upon itself and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=29.64s)]
*  it will certainly face it. Well, the strikes, including on the capital Tehran, have killed [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=34.92s)]
*  the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Major General Hossein Salami, according to Iranian [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=39.92s)]
*  state media. Well, Israel's military says 200 fighter jets completed strikes on more [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  than 100 targets, including nuclear facilities in different areas of Iran. Israel's military [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=52.0s)]
*  claims Iran is advancing a secret program to build nuclear weapons and says Tehran has [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=58.9s)]
*  the capacity to make a nuclear bomb within days. Well, Iran's Supreme Leader says residential [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=64.14s)]
*  areas in Tehran have been hit, while the International Atomic Watchdog has confirmed the Natanz nuclear [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=70.9s)]
*  site was also targeted in the attacks. While Iranian media is reporting, two of Iran's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=78.26s)]
*  top nuclear scientists have been killed. Well, this is where strikes have been reported [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=85.02s)]
*  so far in the capital Tehran, where Iranian state media is reporting residential areas [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=90.46s)]
*  have been hit and civilian casualties are also reported there. Khoromabad in western [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=96.61999999999999s)]
*  Iran, which is home to a large missile base, and Iran's main uranium enrichment facility [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=104.66s)]
*  in Natanz, where the International Atomic Energy Agency is now closely monitoring radiation [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=111.1s)]
*  levels. Well, in the last few minutes, Israeli military has confirmed that Iran has launched [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=115.69999999999999s)]
*  more than 100 drones towards Israel in the past few hours. Well, Israel's Prime Minister [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu says it launched the strike because of Iran's nuclear program poses a [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=131.74s)]
*  threat to the country's very survival. Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=137.66s)]
*  military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival. This operation [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=144.1s)]
*  will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat. For decades, the tyrants [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=151.34s)]
*  of Tehran have brazenly, openly called for Israel's destruction. They've backed up their [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=157.96s)]
*  genocide rhetoric with a program to develop nuclear weapons. In recent years, Iran has [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=164.58s)]
*  produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atom bombs. Nine. In recent months, Iran [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=170.54000000000002s)]
*  has taken steps that it has never taken before, steps to weaponize this enriched uranium. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=178.82s)]
*  And if not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=184.86s)]
*  nuclear weapon in a year. It could be within a few months, less than a year. This is a [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  clear and present danger to Israel's very survival. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=194.94s)]
*  Well, this was live now to Jerusalem. We can speak to our Middle East correspondent, Alistair [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=199.94s)]
*  Bunkle, who's there for us this morning. Hello to you, Alistair. So Benjamin Netanyahu has [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=206.3s)]
*  called this a decisive moment in Israel's history. Just how significant are these strikes [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  by Israel on Iran? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=218.86s)]
*  They are very significant. They're targeting not just Israel's nuclear sites, Iran's nuclear [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=223.34s)]
*  sites, excuse me, but also their ballistic missile program. And as we know now, key leaders [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=228.9s)]
*  in the Iranian regime. The head, the commander of the Revolutionary Guard, the senior political [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  adviser to the supreme leader and potentially others. Multiple waves of Israeli strikes [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=242.0s)]
*  over the last few hours. More than 200 Israeli aircraft involved in the operation, we're [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=248.88s)]
*  told. They've struck more than 100 sites in and around Iran, the length and the breadth [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=254.28s)]
*  of the country. This is designed to, if not totally eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=259.92s)]
*  at least to severely degrade it and push it back many, many years. But it is more than [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=267.92s)]
*  that. It is striking at Iran's wider military capabilities, its ability to be able to respond [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  to Israel. And interestingly, in the last few minutes we've heard that Iran has launched [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=284.44s)]
*  around 100 drones at Israel. Israel is working to shoot them down now. That would be Iran's [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=290.64s)]
*  first response, first retaliation as we know it. And it's not in the form of ballistic [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=298.44s)]
*  missiles, it's in the form of drones that can be lethal, but obviously travel much more [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=304.84s)]
*  slowly than ballistic missiles and don't carry the same payload as ballistic missiles. Maybe, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=310.0s)]
*  that points to the damage that Israel has managed to inflict on Iran's ability to respond [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=316.68s)]
*  to this. We know that in addition to the Israeli Air Force operating overnight, many reports [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=325.36s)]
*  around in Israeli media that the Mossad, Israel's famous intelligence agency that has had success [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=332.4s)]
*  in Iran before, they have also been working to eliminate ballistic missile sites and parts [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=340.28s)]
*  of Iran's nuclear capability. So a huge, wide-ranging attack on Iran and just the beginning. We [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  expect this to last many days. This is not a one and done, but it does look as though [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=354.32s)]
*  Israel is trying to make it once and for all. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQXtf0iScss&t=360.47999999999996s)]
