# 'There must be levels of hell – and we must be on the last,' says emergency worker
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ)
*  Good to have you with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=0.0s)]
*  What is the situation with [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=2.32s)]
*  your facilities at the moment? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=3.84s)]
*  Well, right now most of our [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=7.44s)]
*  facilities are full of injured people. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Yesterday I was touring the Nasser [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=13.08s)]
*  Hospital and it's not only well, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=16.04s)]
*  the ICU and the intensive care unit [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=18.84s)]
*  and the burns units that are full of injured. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=21.76s)]
*  It's also the extension of tents [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=26.28s)]
*  which are usually used for light [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=28.720000000000002s)]
*  cases that are now full with injured. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=31.68s)]
*  I was in the pediatric ward and we have [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  a pediatric intensive care unit there, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=39.32s)]
*  and almost all of the cases were injured children. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Some of them were disfigured. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=47.08s)]
*  Some other had burns. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  There were like several brain injuries. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=52.88s)]
*  So yeah, this is what it looks like. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=57.08s)]
*  The only place where there were no injured [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=60.36s)]
*  was the neonatology intensive care [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=63.96s)]
*  unit for premature babies. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=66.6s)]
*  But as I was touring the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=69.6s)]
*  neonatology intensive care unit, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=72.88s)]
*  I came across the case of a child [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=76.56s)]
*  who is a premature and who was in isolation. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=79.96s)]
*  Because of the living conditions actually, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=84.6s)]
*  he came back to his tent with his mother, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=88.16s)]
*  where he should be living now, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  and got beaten by a rat. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=96.08s)]
*  So this is how people are living now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=98.28s)]
*  They can't even protect themselves from rats. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=100.96s)]
*  There had been 11 weeks of no aid [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  entering Gaza since Israel imposed [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=108.08s)]
*  that blockade on the 2nd of March. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=110.32s)]
*  We're hearing reports that 388 trucks [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=112.72s)]
*  have crossed into Gaza between [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=116.52s)]
*  Monday and Saturday last week. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=118.88s)]
*  Is any of that aid reaching you? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=121.12s)]
*  Are you getting any supplies, any fresh facilities? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=123.52s)]
*  Well, in our case, we were able to enter [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=128.84s)]
*  four trucks into Gaza, four trucks of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=131.68s)]
*  medicines and medical material, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=134.88s)]
*  which is obviously not enough. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=138.32s)]
*  So now we are running to supply new trucks [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=140.44s)]
*  and try to be able to have these trucks [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=145.8s)]
*  as soon as possible into Gaza. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=149.16s)]
*  We have a lot of trucks waiting, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=152.2s)]
*  but they're coming from other places. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=155.16s)]
*  So there are like, I believe, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=160.12s)]
*  more than 900 trucks overall, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=163.32s)]
*  not only MSF without borders trucks waiting. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=165.28s)]
*  But because of some restrictions [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=171.16s)]
*  by the Israeli authorities, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=173.48s)]
*  there are just a certain amount [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=175.44s)]
*  and certain specific trucks that can enter. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=178.64s)]
*  So this is why now we are working to resupply [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=181.68s)]
*  and have our trucks enter as soon as possible. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=185.24s)]
*  When you are seeing disfigured children, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=190.04s)]
*  when you are treating young people [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=193.12s)]
*  with burns and brain injuries, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=195.36s)]
*  when a premature baby is brought back [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  into intensive care because they were [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=200.56s)]
*  bitten by a rat in the tent [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=202.2s)]
*  that they currently call home, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=203.64s)]
*  when only four aid trucks come in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=205.52s)]
*  in the space of weeks to give you [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=208.52s)]
*  the medical care and facilities that you need, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=210.4s)]
*  how do you personally cope in trying to do your job? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=213.24s)]
*  Are you managing to cope in doing the job? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=216.6s)]
*  Well, you know, we are the lucky ones here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=221.76s)]
*  The international staff inside Gaza, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=223.6s)]
*  we feel we're the lucky ones [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=227.28s)]
*  because we can escape this horror. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=229.24s)]
*  We can go back to our families. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  We can go back to our homes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=235.8s)]
*  This is not the case of the Palestinian medical staff. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=239.56s)]
*  This is not the case of the Palestinian humanitarian workers [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  who are actually the majority of the people [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  helping here in Gaza. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=249.88s)]
*  Once they have finished their day job, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=252.8s)]
*  they go back to a tent. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=256.92s)]
*  They go back to struggling to find water. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=259.64000000000004s)]
*  They go back to struggling to find food for their children. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=262.76s)]
*  They go back to fearing [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=268.24s)]
*  that something might happen overnight. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  And then they go back to thinking [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=272.92s)]
*  that their places are destroyed [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=275.88s)]
*  and that they will never see their houses again. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=279.12s)]
*  So actually, we just feel lucky. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  We have a place to stay. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=285.72s)]
*  We have a family to go back to. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=286.88000000000005s)]
*  This all began on the 7th of October 2023. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  You and I are now speaking on the 26th of May 2025. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  How does the situation in Gaza now [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=297.76000000000005s)]
*  compare to what's been before? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=300.92s)]
*  Is this at its worst? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=302.6s)]
*  I think it is at its worst, yes. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=307.36s)]
*  The first time I was in Gaza was December 2023. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  I found it horrible. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=316.28s)]
*  I described it to other journalists as being hell on earth. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  And I was convinced it was hell on earth. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=322.96s)]
*  I mean, there were bombings everywhere. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=326.92s)]
*  We could not sleep because of the noise. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=329.36s)]
*  The people were displacing by thousands, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=333.96s)]
*  by hundreds of thousands. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=338.88s)]
*  They didn't know where to go. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=340.56s)]
*  It was a horrible moment. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=342.68s)]
*  But then here we are again. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=345.76s)]
*  Here we are again with displacement orders. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=348.28s)]
*  Here we are again with people [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=350.84s)]
*  fearing for their lives overnight. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=353.52s)]
*  Here we are again, but all worse [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=356.48s)]
*  because they're mourning so many more people [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=359.12s)]
*  than at the beginning of the war. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=362.56s)]
*  Their children have not been to school since a year and a half. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=364.88s)]
*  There is no university for their teenagers [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=370.64s)]
*  to dream about. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=374.56s)]
*  Everything is just worse. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=377.92s)]
*  Every hope has been crushed. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=380.56s)]
*  So right now, I don't know what to say. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=382.88s)]
*  I think it's, I mean, there must be levels of hell, I guess. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=386.88s)]
*  And I guess we're on the last one. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=391.88s)]
*  Joining us live from Khan Eunice, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=396.68s)]
*  Pascal Croissart, Emergency Coordinator [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=399.0s)]
*  for Medicines en Frontier. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=401.12s)]
*  Appreciate your time, thank you. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVdz_aSLJGQ&t=402.44s)]
