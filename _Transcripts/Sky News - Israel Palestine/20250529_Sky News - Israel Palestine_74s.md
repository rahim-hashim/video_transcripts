# ‘Gaza’s children not just a statistic’
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g)
*  Karim Mahmoud Abdel Amit Jouda. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=0.0s)]
*  And Steve, you were just reading some names out. Could you tell me what that was? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=3.36s)]
*  They were the names of children who'd been killed in the bombing of Gaza in the last 18 months, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=7.12s)]
*  more than 18 months, about 20 months, I must be getting on for. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=12.48s)]
*  And it was just showing that those are not just statistics, they're real people, they're real [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=16.48s)]
*  children who had lives, who died, and it's to some way go to some extent to humanise them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=20.96s)]
*  There is a well-worn phrase that one death is a tragedy and 10,000 is a statistic. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=28.48s)]
*  I think that's the land we're in right now, is that it can sound kind of sterile to mention [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  a statistic, but they're all children who had lives, who had nothing to do with the conflict, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  and they need to be remembered as such. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=47.28s)]
*  Do you think increasingly people are saying enough is enough? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  I think it's sort of tragically, it's taken the mass indiscriminate killing of innocent people [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=53.92s)]
*  to get to this stage, but it would have been difficult to see if you had above the power [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  of that, but it was 18 months ago, but I don't think it is anymore. I think more and more people [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=66.88s)]
*  are realising that it has to stop. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5NIoxhz6g&t=70.8s)]
