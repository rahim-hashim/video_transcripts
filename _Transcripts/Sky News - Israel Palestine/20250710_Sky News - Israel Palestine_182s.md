# Ten children among at least 15 killed waiting for Gaza health clinic to open
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg)
*  This is the aftermath of what Israel calls a targeted strike on a Hamas operative. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=0.0s)]
*  The images are too graphic to show, but most of those killed are women and children. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=9.0s)]
*  Mothers cradle their babies. It is absolute carnage. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=16.0s)]
*  Families had gathered outside a clinic distributing baby formula in Deir al-Bala in central Gaza and were waiting for food when it happened. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=23.0s)]
*  Suddenly at like 7.15am a strike hit in the front door of our primary health clinic, just two metres in front of the clinic. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=33.0s)]
*  So basically we had 16 civilians died, 10 of them are children, 3 of them are women. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=44.0s)]
*  Israel's attacks on Gaza are intensifying all the time as the ceasefire negotiations grind on. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=57.0s)]
*  People here are packing their belongings, displaced again. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=64.0s)]
*  After Israeli tanks moved in on the Almawasi area, the so-called humanitarian safe zone. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=69.0s)]
*  Israel claims it does not target civilians and abides by international law. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=79.0s)]
*  But as fathers rush their lifeless children to hospital, they are denials that are simply not believed here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=85.0s)]
*  This is the aftermath of another mass casualty event. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=94.0s)]
*  The Nasser hospital is overwhelmed and this is now the daily reality. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=99.0s)]
*  A woman weeps over the body of her child. She doesn't know where to turn or what to do. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=105.0s)]
*  Not far away, another family is in total shock. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=113.0s)]
*  This woman's sister was killed and her children were seriously injured after an Israeli strike in Khan Yunis. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=118.0s)]
*  They don't know yet their mother is gone. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=125.0s)]
*  She says, I rushed to the hospital when I found out my sister was dead. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=128.0s)]
*  As she speaks, the boy asks for his mum. She tells him not to worry, mama is fine. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=133.0s)]
*  But despite mounting casualties, Israel's war machine is not slowing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=142.0s)]
*  These IDF pictures show troops moving through the fractured landscape of southern Gaza. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=148.0s)]
*  The Israeli military claims its operations are to destroy Hamas and its infrastructure. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=154.0s)]
*  It claims these images show the demolition of tunnels. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=161.0s)]
*  It is unclear when there will be a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=165.0s)]
*  And until there is, Gaza faces more death, more displacement and more despair. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=170.0s)]
*  Alex Rossi, Sky News, Jerusalem. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJTFVDDoCcg&t=177.0s)]
