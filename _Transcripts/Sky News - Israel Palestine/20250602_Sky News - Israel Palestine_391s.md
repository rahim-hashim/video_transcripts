Video Description: Life in Gaza has become so desperate that some children, who have lost everything, are expressing suicidal ideation, according to Save the Children's Gaza Lead.
The charity has expressed deep concern that some children in Gaza are so traumatised by the war and grief of losing family that they don't want to live anymore. 
Save the Children's Gaza Lead, Georgia Tacey said: "They have lost everything and they are talking about that they also want to end their lives so they can go and be with their parents or siblings who have recently passed."
Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK. In the US, call the Samaritans branch in your area or 1 (800) 273-TALK.

# Save the Children says life in Gaza is 'absolute nightmare' for traumatised children
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4)
*  Sure. I mean, life has become incredibly precarious and dangerous here in Gaza after what's nearly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=0.0s)]
*  been for three months of an aid blockade. I was out of Gaza just for three weeks and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=5.72s)]
*  in that time after returning I've seen a significant deterioration in the physical and mental health [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  of our own team and the children we serve. Walking around the camps and the shelters [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=16.2s)]
*  just close by down the road where there used to be a lot of energy and community spirit [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=21.56s)]
*  even amongst all the poverty. There's now a lot of despair and fatigue and listlessness. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=26.52s)]
*  We're seeing huge spikes in malnutrition in children and pregnant mothers. There's very [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=32.2s)]
*  little food on the market and what is available is just extortionally expensive. And so it's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=36.8s)]
*  a really, really desperate situation for children and families right now in Gaza. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=42.84s)]
*  Yeah, it does sound really desperate, Georgia. Give us an insight into what Save the Children [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=47.4s)]
*  are able to do, are able to help given the context of where you're working. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=53.48s)]
*  So we're very fortunate to still be able to be doing daily water distributions in 16 shelters [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=59.48s)]
*  across the Gaza Strip. We're running nutrition programs to give supplemental feeding to children [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=66.8s)]
*  and mothers who are malnourished. We're running child-friendly spaces where we give children [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=72.44s)]
*  an opportunity to escape the absolute nightmare they're living and process some of the stress [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=78.12s)]
*  and trauma they're experiencing. And we're running temporary education spaces for children [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  just to try and keep up with the minimum amount of education to get them through. So it's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=89.0s)]
*  a drop in the ocean. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. And what you're doing sounds amazing given the circumstances. I was just interested [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=97.0s)]
*  in what you said there about child-friendly spaces. Tell us how you're able to emotionally [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  help children. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=107.02s)]
*  Well, this is what Save the Children do in crisis. We have trained professionals and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=109.7s)]
*  social workers and counsellors that work directly with children who are surrounded by grief [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=113.14s)]
*  and trauma. So many of the children we're working with have lost their parents, their [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=118.66s)]
*  siblings, their neighbours, their friends who have been killed right in front of them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=122.94s)]
*  Many of them have had to endure painful surgeries without anaesthesia, without family or support. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=127.06s)]
*  So our teams are there providing them a space where they can play, they can do art therapy, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=133.58s)]
*  they can process the trauma through both psychological exercises as well as physical exercises. And [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=140.06s)]
*  we're also teaching children how to be good friends to one another to support their children [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=146.86s)]
*  and friends who are also going through similar crises. So a couple of hours a day, it's just [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  an escape from the atrocities that they're seeing in their own backyard. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=157.34s)]
*  What struck you the most, Georgia? Any stories you can tell us about interactions you've [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=163.42s)]
*  had with children in those child-friendly spaces? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=167.66s)]
*  You know, we always say, which is true, that children are incredibly resilient and they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=171.34s)]
*  are and they are always a joyful space for us to go into. We often brace ourselves for [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=175.1s)]
*  what horrific stories are we going to hear today, but you often leave feeling so much [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=180.38s)]
*  better that we ourselves are healed through working with children. But I will say what [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=183.98s)]
*  is deeply, deeply concerning right now is the amount of children who are expressing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=189.78s)]
*  suicidal ideation. They have lost everything and they are talking about that they also [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=193.94s)]
*  want to end their lives so they can go be with their parents or their siblings who have [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=198.82s)]
*  recently passed. So that's deeply troubling. They're desperate and they're starving. And [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=202.22s)]
*  so what we want to have is those borders open and let us do our jobs, let us deliver aid [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  to these communities. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=212.34s)]
*  On the ground, when you're talking to families, mums and dads, children too, what's the overall [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=214.54s)]
*  sense that you're getting from them? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=220.38s)]
*  Well, I think the big change in these last couple of weeks has been this despair that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=223.34s)]
*  they hear of a ceasefire, everyone gets very hopeful and they build themselves up for any [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  minute there's going to be a ceasefire. And then they see these catastrophic aid distributions [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=233.45999999999998s)]
*  where people are being shot at and killed from just trying to receive aid. And so you [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  do see these big psychological dips of both caregivers and children. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=243.38s)]
*  And then it's local time, it's 8.45 in the morning where you are. Give us an insight [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=250.18s)]
*  to the day of an aid work, aid distribution centres. What do you do? How do you plan for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=255.26s)]
*  a day in Gaza? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=260.98s)]
*  Well, certainly for our team, our national staff here, it is very different from 18 months [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=262.46s)]
*  ago just to get to work as a really dangerous enterprise. Because of the fuel crisis, everyone [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=268.14s)]
*  is mainly on foot, they can walk up to two hours a day just to get to our office. And [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=274.09999999999997s)]
*  that is after they've been up in the morning finding firewood, trying to find some food [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=278.38s)]
*  for their own children so they can risk their lives to come to work to serve other people's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  children. Then they will be going out in our buses to different sites where they might [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=286.78s)]
*  be either running child services or they might be delivering water or they might be delivering [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=291.62s)]
*  hygiene packages. And they are out meeting with community leaders, making sure people [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  know that our distribution will be safe and calm and equitable and reaching the most vulnerable. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=301.54s)]
*  They're out there for a couple of hours a day. Our security team are running 24-7 to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=307.58s)]
*  make sure that we are avoiding, where we can, airstrikes and any dangerous evacuations. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=312.58s)]
*  And then they're coming back to the office in enough time to report on what they've seen [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=318.12s)]
*  and done for the day before they start the arduous and dangerous journey back to their [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=322.22s)]
*  homes where they are anxious to make sure their entire family is still intact after [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=326.18s)]
*  a day of their phone having a million alerts about all the different evacuation notices, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=330.86s)]
*  airstrikes, explosions. And so our staff are just constantly living in this hypervigilant [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=335.58000000000004s)]
*  anxious state whilst they're serving the most vulnerable. They're also thinking about, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=341.06s)]
*  is my family going to be intact tonight when I get home? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  Georgia, just before you leave us, because I know you have to get on personally, what [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=349.3s)]
*  keeps you doing this job? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=353.21999999999997s)]
*  Exactly those people I just described. It's very hard not to get emotional about it, just [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=356.38s)]
*  to see the strength and resilience that our team have. And one of my colleagues who I [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=361.18s)]
*  commented the other day, I said, man, you look amazing. He's like, I'm faking it. I've [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=366.26s)]
*  got to fake it for everyone. And hopefully my children will think it's normal and they'll [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=370.18s)]
*  also act with confidence. So I think they're faking it till they make it. And I really [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=374.9s)]
*  appreciate it. And it's really inspiring. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=379.05999999999995s)]
*  OK, thank you so much for your time, Georgia Tacey there from Save the Children in Gaza. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=381.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQbXnJ_qS4&t=386.97999999999996s)]
