*  in Westminster where the names of children killed in the war were read out. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=12.88s)]

*  They're real people, they're real children who had lives, who died and it's to some [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=28.04s)]
*  way go to some extent to humanise them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  Do you think the international community, the UK, France, Canada, condemning what's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=36.56s)]
*  happening is sufficient? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=42.12s)]
*  There's certainly more material things need to be done. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=43.12s)]
*  We need to stop sending arms to Israel right now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=46.36s)]
*  I think that would be a very important signal. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=48.36s)]
*  When people talk about being frightened to speak out, I don't have a lot of patience [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=54.56s)]

*  Everybody has to imagine what it would be like to be living in that nightmare, that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=60.32s)]
*  hellscape and act as human beings. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=64.08s)]

*  Do you think increasingly people are saying enough is enough? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=82.36s)]
*  I think it's sort of tragically, it's taken the mass indiscriminate killing of innocent [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=85.88s)]
*  people to get to this stage. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=94.08s)]
*  But it would have been difficult to stick your head above the parapet. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=96.4s)]
*  In fact, it was 18 months ago. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=98.88s)]
*  But I don't think it is anymore. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  I think more and more people are realising that it has to stop. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtgfpvp5Ugk&t=101.96000000000001s)]
