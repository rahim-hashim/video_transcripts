Video Description: The International Court of Justice hears arguments about what Israel must do to provide aid to Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.

# World Court hears arguments against Israel's Gaza aid blockade | Day three
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4)
*  The ongoing conflict in Gaza is a critical issue for the international community. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=0.0s)]
*  This week, many speakers have focused on the factual circumstances of that conflict. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5.44s)]
*  They have voiced significant concerns about the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12.16s)]
*  You have also heard concerns about Israel's decision to cease engagement with UNRWA. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=18.72s)]
*  You have heard little, however, about the serious, incredible concerns about Hamas misusing UNRWA's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=24.4s)]
*  facilities and humanitarian assistance. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  You have also heard little of Israel's security needs after the terrorist attacks on October 7, 2023. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=35.6s)]
*  These security needs persist today. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=45.28s)]
*  Many hostages, including Americans, are still being wrongfully held in horrendous conditions. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  These are grave circumstances, and they warrant careful attention. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=56.56s)]
*  But the General Assembly's expedited request, and therefore this advisory proceeding, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=62.4s)]
*  focuses solely on a request to identify legal obligations. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  It is not about adjudicating the facts or determining legal consequences. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=74.88s)]
*  The United States submits that what is before the Court is a legal question [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=81.28s)]
*  consisting of two narrow legal issues, and that the answers are clear under well-established rules [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  of international law. These answers would apply regardless of the particular state. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=94.16s)]
*  The first issue focuses on the obligations of an occupying power, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=100.8s)]
*  and the second focuses on the obligations of a UN member state. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=105.6s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, allow me to first address the obligations of an occupying power [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=112.0s)]
*  to the United Nations, international organizations, and third states with respect to humanitarian [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  assistance. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=124.16s)]
*  International law does not impose any unqualified obligations on an occupying power regarding all [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=125.76s)]
*  these entities, much less any particular entity. The applicable international rules have been [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=133.36s)]
*  carefully developed through state consent to treaties and customary international law. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=140.96s)]
*  As the Court repeatedly recognized, international humanitarian law is the lex specialis governing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=147.92s)]
*  the obligation of parties to armed conflict. Within that lex specialis, it is the law of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  occupation that establishes an occupying power's specific rights and obligations. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=161.04s)]
*  Before developing international law, the United States has been very careful to recognize that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=167.6s)]
*  rights and obligations. Before diving into the particular obligations of any occupying power, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=174.4s)]
*  we should step back to understand the context for why states have agreed to specific rights and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=182.4s)]
*  duties in occupation law. As the Court has previously observed, occupation is a question of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=187.84s)]
*  fact. An occupation law describes the rights and responsibilities for administering control [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=194.8s)]
*  over occupied territory. An occupying power has obligations related to maintaining public [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=201.28s)]
*  order and safety, and protecting the civilian population. It also has the right, while an [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  occupier, to pursue its military objectives and govern enemy territory. In the law of occupation, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=214.4s)]
*  therefore, military and humanitarian interests converge. This means that where specific provisions [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=222.4s)]
*  of that law call on an occupying power to provide the civilian population with relief, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=231.04s)]
*  the occupying power does not lose its right to ensure its own security. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=237.76s)]
*  With this framing in mind, I will address the specific limited obligations of an occupying [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=245.04s)]
*  power toward third states and organizations in two categories. First, obligations on allowing [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  and facilitating relief for the civilian population, and second, rules relating to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=258.96s)]
*  the impartiality of humanitarian organizations. In both categories, occupation law preserves an [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  occupying power's discretion to address its security interests, including the ability to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=272.88s)]
*  curtail the activities of third states or organizations that are contrary to its security. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=278.88s)]
*  For the first category, most submissions of the Fourth Geneva Convention state that when the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=284.8s)]
*  population of the occupied territory is, quote, is inadequately supplied, the occupying power shall [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=290.08s)]
*  agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population and shall facilitate them by all the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=296.24s)]
*  means at its disposal. Several submissions incorrectly assert that this means that Article [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  59 requires an occupying power to agree to all relief offered by all outside organizations. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=308.16s)]
*  But the text of Article 59 contains no such expansive language, nor does it prescribe [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=315.12s)]
*  which relief schemes an occupying power must consent to. The only mention of third parties [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=323.36s)]
*  comes in the next paragraph of Article 59, which states, quote, that the occupying power [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=330.32000000000005s)]
*  shall be provided by all the means at its disposal. The word impartial is obviously important, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=336.8s)]
*  and I will return to it. But for now, focus on the fact that this provision is not only [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  a provision of food, food supplies, and clothing, but also a provision of food supplies, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=349.44s)]
*  medical supplies, and clothing. The word impartial is obviously important, and I will return to it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=355.68s)]
*  But for now, focus on the fact that this provision is actually a definition of what [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=363.6s)]
*  a relief scheme provides. That is, food, medical supplies, and clothing. The language on third [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=370.32s)]
*  parties merely describes possible providers of relief, which is clear from the words may [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=378.0s)]
*  and such as before the example of the International Committee of the Red Cross. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  It is also critically important that Article 59 does not remove an occupying power's authority [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  to ensure public order and safety in the territory. In other words, an occupying power retains a [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=396.24s)]
*  margin of appreciation concerning which relief schemes to permit. Thus, even if an organization [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=403.92s)]
*  offering relief is an impartial humanitarian organization, and even if it is a military [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=413.04s)]
*  organization, and even if it is a major actor, occupation law does not require an occupying [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=419.04s)]
*  power to allow and facilitate that specific actor's relief operations. An occupying power [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=424.48s)]
*  may also fulfill its humanitarian obligations toward the civilian population while advancing [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=431.92s)]
*  its own military and security interests. An example can be found in Article 55 of the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=437.52s)]
*  Geneva Convention. Article 55 describes the obligation of an occupying power [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=444.56s)]
*  to ensure the food and medical supplies of the population. But as the ICRC commentary explains, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=450.64s)]
*  under Article 55, quote, the occupying authorities retain complete freedom of action [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=458.32s)]
*  in regard to this and are thus in a position to take the circumstances of the moment into account. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=465.28s)]
*  End quote. Similarly, while Article 63 recognizes that national Red Cross societies and other [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=472.4s)]
*  relief societies are permitted to continue their humanitarian work under Red Cross principles, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=480.32s)]
*  an occupying power may still impose restrictive measures for urgent reasons of security. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=486.4s)]
*  I turn now to the second category, which is a fundamentally important limitation built into [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=493.12s)]
*  occupation law. Articles 59 and 61 of the Fourth Geneva Convention make clear that collective [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=499.04s)]
*  relief may be conducted by third states or, quote, impartial humanitarian organizations. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=506.32s)]
*  As many submissions acknowledge, impartiality requires that humanitarian relief [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  be distributed in a non-discriminatory manner. However, the concept of impartiality in the phrase [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=521.2s)]
*  impartial humanitarian organization also refers to taking no side in the armed conflict. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=528.72s)]
*  The ICRC commentary to Article 59 makes this clear. It says that, quote, only those states [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=536.32s)]
*  which are neutral are capable of providing the essential guarantees of impartiality. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  End quote. And the commentary to Article 61 shows that the term impartiality in describing [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=549.76s)]
*  organizations providing relief is synonymous with neutrality. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=557.44s)]
*  Here, there are serious concerns about UNRWA's impartiality, including information that Hamas [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=563.2800000000001s)]
*  has used UNRWA facilities and that UNRWA staff participated in the October 7 terrorist attack [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=571.12s)]
*  against Israel. Israel therefore has ample grounds to question UNRWA's impartiality. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=578.6400000000001s)]
*  Some have argued that the evidence is insufficient or that the UN's investigation and the Kelowna [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=587.44s)]
*  report have resolved concerns about UNRWA. But the Kelowna report itself recognizes that, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  quote, neutrality-related issues persist for UNRWA and that there continue to be serious [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=602.32s)]
*  challenges with respect to UNRWA's oversight and accountability. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=610.32s)]
*  Again, the court need not and should not reach these factual issues. But given these concerns, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  it is clear that Israel has no obligation to permit UNRWA specifically to provide humanitarian [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=623.84s)]
*  assistance. UNRWA is not the only option for providing humanitarian assistance in Gaza. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=630.6400000000001s)]
*  In sum, there is no legal requirement that an occupying power permit a specific third state [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=637.84s)]
*  or international organization to conduct activities in occupied territory that would compromise its [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=644.32s)]
*  security interests. To hold otherwise would be contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=650.08s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the court, I turn now to the obligations of Israel as a UN member state. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  The Security Council and General Assembly have worked for decades toward an end to the conflict [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=666.16s)]
*  between Israel and the Palestinians. Throughout that long history, Israel has hosted and engaged [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  with the UN, UN agencies and UN representatives. Some participants have argued that this engagement [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=678.4s)]
*  has resulted in a lack of transparency and transparency in the UN's response to UNRWA's [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=686.16s)]
*  participation. Some participants have argued that this engagement has resulted in or arisen out of [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=692.8s)]
*  additional obligations on Israel solely by virtue of Israel's membership in the United Nations. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=697.8399999999999s)]
*  Those arguments rest on mischaracterizations of the UN Charter. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=705.4399999999999s)]

*  Mr. President, Madam Vice President, members of the Court, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1526.8s)]
*  It is an honor to address the Court, the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1538.8s)]
*  on behalf of the Russian Federation. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1546.8s)]
*  Today, we confront a crisis of legality and humanity in light of systematic undermining [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1548.8s)]
*  of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees by Israel [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1558.8s)]
*  and its negligence towards the overall obligations under international law, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1564.8s)]
*  including those stemming from the status of Israel as an occupying power. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1570.8s)]
*  The urgency of this matter cannot be overstated. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1576.8s)]
*  Gaza balances on the brink of famine. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1582.8s)]
*  Hospitals lie in ruins. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1586.8s)]
*  Millions of Palestinians in the Strip as well as in the West Bank, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1588.8s)]
*  including East Jerusalem, face existential despair. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1594.8s)]
*  Mr. President, the General Assembly's request for an advisory opinion adopted by 137 states [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1598.8s)]
*  in Resolution 79-232 is based on Article 96 of the UN Charter and Articles 65 of the ICJ Statute. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1606.8s)]
*  These articles provide for the advisory resdiction of the Court. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1618.8s)]
*  Some states, including Israel, in their written statements, have argued that this request is politically charged, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1622.8s)]
*  concerns bilateral relations, and the subject of the ongoing proceedings between South Africa and Israel [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1632.8s)]
*  one application of the Genocide Convention. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1640.8s)]
*  This is not the first time the Court considers the right of the United Nations to adopt an advisory opinion. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1644.8s)]
*  For the first time, the Court considers the relevant aspects of the conflict between Israel and Palestine. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1650.8s)]
*  The Court's 2004 Wall Advisory Opinion and 2024 Opinion on the Policies and Practices of Israel [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1658.8s)]
*  in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, established irrefutable precedents. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1666.8s)]
*  In 2004, the Court affirmed that Israel's construction of the Wall violated international humanitarian law. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1674.8s)]
*  In 2024, it reaffirmed Israel's status as an occupying power in the Palestinian territory, including the Gaza Strip. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1682.8s)]
*  These opinions constitute a solid foundation for facilitating peace in the region [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1694.8s)]
*  and ensuring the rights of Palestinians to self-determination, as well as providing for legal qualification of Israeli actions. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1700.8s)]
*  They also serve as a basis for the present request of the United Nations General Assembly. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1710.8s)]
*  Today, we address a new dimension, Israel's October 2024 laws banning unreserved operations, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1716.8s)]
*  which in our view directly contravene the norms of the IHL, the UN Charter, and the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Divinities of the United Nations. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1726.8s)]
*  Under Article 30 of the letter, disputes over its interpretation must be referred to this Court. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1738.8s)]
*  Thus, the Russian Federation advised the Court to follow its own reasoning on jurisdiction and discretion [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1748.8s)]
*  to hear the present case used in 2024 advisory opinion. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1757.8s)]
*  Since the factual and legal background of these cases are quite similar, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1762.8s)]
*  besides, the question put before this Court is strictly legal. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1768.8s)]
*  It concerns Israel's duties as an occupying power under IHL and its obligations to uphold the privileges and the munities of the UN agencies, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1774.8s)]
*  other international organizations, and third states in and in relation to the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1788.8s)]
*  Therefore, we maintain that judicial restraint here would undermine the very architecture of international law. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1797.8s)]
*  Mr. President, to understand the importance of this moment, we must reflect on history. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1806.8s)]
*  As established in 1949 by General Assembly Resolution 302, ANWA was created to address the catastrophic displacement of 750,000 Palestinians. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1814.8s)]
*  Today, it serves 5.9 million Palestinian refugees across Gaza and West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1829.8s)]
*  For 75 years, ANWA has been more than just an aid agency. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1839.8s)]
*  It is a symbol of international community's collective responsibility to the Palestinian people, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1845.8s)]
*  striving for a state of their own, an exercise of their right to serve determination in accordance with international law and return. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1852.8s)]
*  The role of ANWA in facilitating the humanitarian aid is crucial, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1863.8s)]
*  and its work is strongly supported by the vast majority of the international community. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1868.8s)]
*  The agency's mandate, education, health care, and emergency relief is not mere charity. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1875.8s)]
*  These fears are legal obligations of the occupying power under IHL. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1884.8s)]
*  When Israel occupied Gaza and the West Bank in 1967, it inherited the duty to ensure the welfare of the population on the occupied territory. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1890.8s)]
*  Instead, this responsibility was outsourced to ANWA and other UN agencies and programs, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1900.8s)]
*  relying on the agency's schools, clinics, and distribution networks to mitigate the humanitarian impact of Israel's own policies. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1908.8s)]
*  In Gaza, as mentioned in the United Nations Security Council press statement of 30 October 2024, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1918.8s)]
*  ANWA remains the backbone of all humanitarian response, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1929.8s)]
*  and no organization can replace or substitute ANWA's capacity and mandate to serve Palestinian refugees and civilians [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1934.8s)]
*  in urgent need of life-saving humanitarian assistance. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1943.8s)]
*  Now, with the resumption of Israel's military operation in Gaza, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1948.8s)]
*  together with the imposition of a total blockade since 2 March, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1954.8s)]
*  the Strip has continued to endure devastating destruction and a humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented scale. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1959.8s)]
*  The West Bank, where Israel has launched its full-scale military operation on 21 January, risks repeating a terrible Gaza scenario. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1969.8s)]
*  ANWA's installations and personnel are under attack there too, as well as in East Jerusalem, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1979.8s)]
*  where after the enactment of the Knesset bills on the cessation of ANWA's operations, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1987.8s)]
*  all the offices, including the historic premises Sheikh Jarrah and Qalandia, operated since 1950, were arbitrarily closed. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=1994.8s)]
*  By doing so, Israel, for the first time in history, unilaterally prohibited the work of the United Nations Agency [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2005.8s)]
*  and deprived it of its privileges and immunities. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2014.8s)]
*  It is also worth mentioning here that since this year, ANWA has been again nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2019.8s)]
*  Awarding this prize will obviously be timely and well deserved, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2028.8s)]
*  taking into account the highest prize the Agency has paid during the recent crisis in the Middle East. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2033.8s)]
*  Israeli military operations claimed lives of 290 of ANWA's staff members. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2040.8s)]
*  To this effect, Russia has been consistently advocating for unconditional and sustainable ceasefire, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2047.8s)]
*  the release of all hostages and detainees, safe and unhindered humanitarian access, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2056.8s)]
*  as well as the restart of the peace process on a universally recognized international legal basis [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2062.8s)]
*  with two state solution formulae at the centre. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2069.8s)]
*  Mr. President, it is the position of the Russian Federation, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2074.8s)]
*  which is based entirely on the advisory opinions of the Court of 2004 and 2024, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2080.8s)]
*  that Israel, as the occupying power, is bound by the IHL, including the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Hague regulations. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2089.8s)]
*  The Court observed in the wall advisory opinion that in the 1967 armed conflict, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2100.8s)]
*  Israel occupied the territory between the so-called Green Line and the former eastern boundary of Palestine [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2109.8s)]
*  under the British mandate, namely the West Bank and East Jerusalem. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2116.8s)]
*  The situation since then has not improved, but rather deteriorated. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2122.8s)]
*  According to the 2024 advisory opinion, Israel's withdrawal from Gaza Strip has not entirely released it [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2129.8s)]
*  of its obligations under the law of occupation. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2138.8s)]
*  Therefore, Israel to this day remains an occupying power in terms of IHL, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2142.8s)]
*  and its relevant rules and principles are fully applicable to Israel. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2149.8s)]
*  We consider the following provisions of IHL as especially pertinent to the case in hand. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2155.8s)]
*  Under Article 43 of the Hague regulations, and I quote, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2163.8s)]
*  the occupant shall take all the measures in his power to restore, to ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety. End of quote. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2168.8s)]
*  Under the Court's interpretation in the opinion of 2024, this includes the duty to administer the territory for the benefit of the local population. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2180.8s)]
*  Article 50, paragraph 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides that the occupying power shall, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2193.8s)]
*  with the cooperation of the national and local authorities, facilitate the proper working of all institutions devoted to the care and education of children. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2203.8s)]
*  Article 55, paragraph 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention further provides that, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2215.8s)]
*  and I quote, to the fullest extent of the means available to it, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2222.8s)]
*  the occupying power has the duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2228.8s)]
*  It should, in particular, bring in the necessary foodstuffs, medical stores, and other articles, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2235.8s)]
*  if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate. End of quote. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2245.8s)]
*  Article 56, paragraph 1 of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides that, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2250.8s)]
*  and I quote, the occupying power has the duty of ensuring and maintaining the medical and hospital establishments and services, public health, hygiene in the occupied territory. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2256.8s)]
*  End of quote. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2270.8s)]
*  Article 51 obliges Israel to facilitate humanitarian relief schemes by all the means at its disposal, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2272.8s)]
*  if the whole or part of the population of the occupied territory is inadequately supplied. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2280.8s)]
*  None of that is happening today. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2288.8s)]
*  As stated in the UN Secretary General's press encounter on Gaza of the 8th of April 2025, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2293.8s)]
*  Israel and its supporting states claim that other agencies can replace UNRWA, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2303.8s)]
*  and the occupying power has discretion to determine whether, when, and to what extent, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2309.8s)]
*  other parties may be present and operate in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2317.8s)]
*  I respectfully ask the Court not to follow this line of logic. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2323.8s)]
*  Firstly, no organization possesses UNRWA's infrastructure in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2327.8s)]
*  65 clinics, 12 food distribution centers in Gaza, and 30,000 local staff. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2336.8s)]
*  Without UNRWA, Gaza's humanitarian system will collapse. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2345.8s)]
*  And secondly, the mention before Article 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention unquotely obliges the occupying state to agree to the relief schemes on behalf of the said population. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2351.8s)]
*  The Fourth Geneva Convention not only lays down that the occupying power must agree to the said relief schemes, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2369.8s)]
*  but insists that it must facilitate them by all the means at its disposal. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2377.8s)]
*  The occupation authorities must therefore cooperate wholeheartedly in the rapid and scrupulous execution of these schemes. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2385.8s)]
*  Israel claims its laws on UNRWA are necessary for national security. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2396.8s)]
*  Israel has the right to ensure its own security. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2402.8s)]
*  But the path to this goal lies exclusively through comprehensive Middle East settlement process [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2407.8s)]
*  and the realization of the legitimate right of Palestinians to their own state within the borders of 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2414.8s)]
*  The right derives from one of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, the right to self-determination of peoples. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2428.8s)]
*  Even so, the security concerns do not absolve Israel from other norms of international law, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2438.8s)]
*  including the norms on privileges and immunities of international organizations. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2448.8s)]
*  Furthermore, the Fourth Geneva Convention in its Article 59 provides for safeguards that the relief consignments may be searched by the occupying power. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2454.8s)]
*  UNRWA has cooperated with Israeli authorities for decades, sharing staff leads, facilitating aid coordination, and conducting a thorough audit. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2466.8s)]
*  The results of which are available to the public. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2478.8s)]
*  We maintain that security issues should be subject to substantive cooperation and discussions between Israel and UNRWA to mitigate these concerns. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2483.8s)]
*  Since the laws on the cessation of UNRWA operations also prohibit all contacts between Israel's government and UNRWA, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2495.8s)]
*  the much-needed negotiations are stalled on the part of Israel. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2505.8s)]
*  Given the crucial role UNRWA has played in over 75 years of its activities in the region, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2513.8s)]
*  on behalf of the Palestinians, the cessation of its operations will result in the catastrophic scarcity of supplies and assistance to populations of the occupied Palestinian territory, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2520.8s)]
*  including refugees in the neighboring countries – Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2535.8s)]
*  Israel's laws on the prohibition of the work of UNRWA will undoubtedly worsen the humanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian territory [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2543.8s)]
*  and will make the population in the territory inadequately supplied, the language used in Article 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2553.8s)]
*  The role of the Agency in providing complex assistance to the Palestinians is crucial to ensure their fundamental rights, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2566.8s)]
*  including the cornerstone UN Charter right to self-determination, within the two-state solution framework. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2574.8s)]
*  Mr. President, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2583.8s)]
*  Turning to the issues of privileges and immunities, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2585.8s)]
*  the Russian Federation submits that UNRWA's legal status is clear. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2590.8s)]
*  As a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly under Article 22 of the UN Charter, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2595.8s)]
*  with a clear humanitarian mandate, it is entitled to privileges and immunities under the 1946 Convention. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2601.8s)]
*  Furthermore, according to Article 105 of the UN Charter, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2610.8s)]
*  the organization shall enjoy in the territory of each of its members such privileges and immunities as unnecessary for the fulfillment of its purposes. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2617.8s)]
*  Israel's October 2024 laws revoking UNRWA's immunities, criminalizing its staff, and seizing its assets [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2630.8s)]
*  constitute a violation of this framework. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2639.8s)]
*  In no way do the provisions of the UN Convention of 1946 allow the unilateral revocation of privileges and immunities. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2644.8s)]
*  The privileges and immunities of the United Nations play an important role in ensuring the functioning of this organization. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2653.8s)]
*  They are necessary to fulfill the basic functions of the United Nations, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2664.8s)]
*  such as maintaining peace and security, promoting international cooperation, and protecting human rights. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2669.8s)]
*  Privileges and immunities allow the United Nations to carry out its activities freely, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2676.8s)]
*  without fear of persecution by states or individuals. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2683.8s)]
*  This ensures the independence and the partiality of the organization in carrying out its tasks. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2688.8s)]
*  Israel's legislation is not merely unlawful. It is an attack on the UN fundamental principles. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2696.8s)]
*  If tolerated, it sets a very dangerous precedent for states to dismantle any UN agency they deem inconvenient. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2704.8s)]
*  Within the broader context of Arab-Israeli conflict, it is necessary to highlight that other UN structures, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2715.8s)]
*  Anfield and Andof in Lebanon and Syria, have also been negatively affected and obstructed by Israeli invasions [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2724.8s)]
*  and continued unlawful military presence. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2735.8s)]
*  In a more broad context, the United Nations and missions of states to the UN were also impacted. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2739.8s)]
*  There were numerous violations by Biden and the Obama administrations of the agreement [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2747.8s)]
*  regarding the headquarters of the United Nations of 1977 and the UN Convention of 1946. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2754.8s)]
*  Part of the official premises of the Russian mission is the United Nations in New York. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2761.8s)]
*  It was blocked. Issues of visas of the state representatives for meetings under the auspices of the United Nations [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2767.8s)]
*  and of the UN staff members of a specific nationality were deliberately hindered. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2776.8s)]
*  Movement restrictions were put into effect. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2782.8s)]
*  Similar violations regarding issues of visas are committed by France as the host country of UNESCO. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2788.8s)]
*  The erosion of privileges and immunities strikes at the heart of multilateralism, undermining the UN's capacities. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2797.8s)]
*  Mr. President, Adam was president, members of the court. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2810.8s)]
*  This case transcends legal technicalities. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2815.8s)]
*  Andras collapse would not only doom millions of Palestinians, it would shatter the credibility of the UN system. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2820.8s)]
*  Therefore, the Russian Federation respectfully submits the following. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2830.8s)]
*  First, in our opinion, the court has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the General Assembly. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2834.8s)]
*  Second, we believe that there are no compelling reasons for the court to exercise its discretion not to consider the question posed by the General Assembly. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2843.8s)]
*  Third, Israel, as the occupying power, has the obligation not to impede the Palestinian people from exercising its right to self-determination. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2855.8s)]
*  Fourth, as the occupying power, Israel is obliged under IHL to ensure and facilitate the unkitted provision of humanitarian aid and assistance to the Palestinian population. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2868.8s)]
*  Fifth, due to the unique role of UNRWA in the occupied Palestinian territory, Israeli laws on the prohibition of the agency's activities violate IHL norms and principles. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2884.8s)]
*  Implementation of these laws will undoubtedly worsen the humanitarian situation for the Palestinian population and significantly hinder the realization of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2901.8s)]
*  Sixth, the passing laws on UNRWA, Israel unilaterally deprives UNRWA of its privileges and immunities, which is a violation of the UN Charter and the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations of 1946. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2918.8s)]
*  Mr. President, Madam Vice President, Members of the Court, let this Court's opinion be a beacon of hope, a reformation that international law, and not the so-called rules-based order, governs actions of states and international organizations. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2941.8s)]
*  Thank you for your attention. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2962.8s)]
*  I thank the representative of the Russian Federation for his presentation. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2965.8s)]
*  I now invite the following delegation, that of France, to take the floor. And I would like to call Mr. Diego Colas to the podium. You have the floor, sir. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2975.8s)]
*  Merci, Monsieur le Président. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2987.8s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, France would like, first of all, to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this Court. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2988.8s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, my presence before you forms part of the continuing efforts made by my country in order to put an end to the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, and more generally throughout the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=2997.8s)]
*  France deplores the considerable difficulties in accessing reliable information owing to the serious attacks against an increasing number of journalists. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3016.8s)]
*  That being so, the information which Dutch reach us from Gaza is alarming. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3027.8s)]
*  On the 24th of April, according to the figures of the Gaza Health Ministry, the human toll of the war amounted to over 51,300 deaths and 117,000 wounded. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3032.8s)]
*  We must also mention the total interruption of humanitarian aid since the 2nd of March, the depletion of essential items including food stocks, as well as the violent military operations carried out, many of which affect civilians and humanitarian workers. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3046.8s)]
*  With regard to humanitarian workers, 418 of them have been killed since October 2023, including 290 personnel from the UN Relief and Works Agency for the Palestinian Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, or the agency. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3068.8s)]
*  In response to this situation that France will never cease to condemn, our position will remain firm and unwavering. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3087.8s)]
*  Humanitarian aid must reach Gaza at scale. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3095.8s)]
*  Restrictions to its access must be lifted without delay. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3100.8s)]
*  All the crossing points must be open. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3104.8s)]
*  And the work of humanitarian organisations must be facilitated and their personnel protected in compliance with international law. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3107.8s)]
*  It is against this backdrop of emergency that the present proceeding take place, and which will enable the Court to clarify Israel's obligations in relation to the humanitarian presence and activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, and in relation to it, in support of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3116.8s)]
*  The question put to the Court calls for four introductory remarks. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3141.8s)]
*  First of all, it deals with Israel's obligations. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3146.8s)]
*  It will therefore fall to the Court to precisely identify these obligations and the conditions of their observance. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3150.8s)]
*  The question does not explicitly mention, as was the case for other requests for opinion, the legal consequences of a given behaviour. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3158.8s)]
*  However, the General Assembly, which requested the opinion, and States, will have to draw all the relevant consequences from it. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3167.8s)]
*  Secondly, the question put refers to the activities of other international organisations. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3174.8s)]
*  Given the essential role of non-governmental organisations such as Médecins du Monde or Action contre la Fin in the occupied Palestinian territory, France considers that their activities must also be taken into account in the present proceeding. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3183.8s)]
*  However, in the time allocated in view of the factual circumstances which gave rise to the seating of the Court, my statement will chiefly deal with the presence and activities of ANWA. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3201.8s)]
*  Thirdly, because of the expression in relation to the territorial scope of the question is not limited to the occupied Palestinian territory alone. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3216.8s)]
*  This wording indeed invites the Court to examine the international obligations that Israel must honour on its own territory insofar as their fulfilment is likely to have consequences throughout the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3229.8s)]
*  Finally, France has constantly recalled the importance of complying with the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3245.8s)]
*  The only chance for it to be exercised according to France is a two-state solution, the only solution capable of guaranteeing peace and security in the long term for Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3253.8s)]
*  As my country has already underlined, supplying humanitarian aid and development aid will allow for the necessary conditions for the Palestinian people in the long run to be able to exercise its right to self-determination. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3268.8s)]
*  This aid therefore is part and parcel of the exercise of the right for Palestinians for their self-determination. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3284.8s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, in light of these introductory remarks, my argument will successively describe Israel's obligations which stem from its quality as a member state of the United Nations and then those stemming from its quality of occupying power in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3291.8s)]
*  It is important to underline that these obligations are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary, they are simultaneously applicable and complement each other. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3313.8s)]
*  With regard to the obligations arising from United Nations law, I will begin by addressing the general obligations of Israel in relation to the presence and activities of UNRWA in the occupied Palestinian territory and in relation to it, and then more specifically the privileges, immunities and facilities owed to the agency as a UN organization. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3325.8s)]
*  First of all, it should be recalled that as for any subsidiary body of the General Assembly of the United Nations, the presence and activities of UNRWA on a given territory are subject to the consent of the parties concerned. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3353.8s)]
*  Israel and UNRWA have concluded several agreements, including an agreement concerning assistance to Palestinian refugees which entered into force on 14 June 1967, which I will hereafter call the 1967 Agreement. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3369.8s)]
*  This agreement governs the activities of UNRWA in the occupied Palestinian territory, but also activities in relation to it. Some of its provisions indeed refer to the entry of vehicles and personnel of the agency into Israel. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3388.8s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority has also reached a number of agreements with UNRWA, including an agreement relating to the location of its headquarters in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, signed in Ramallah on 5 July 1996. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3404.8s)]
*  On 28 October 2024, Knesset adopted two laws aiming at prohibiting the activities of the agency in Israel and through a questionable extension of its domestic law throughout the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3420.8s)]
*  This legislation, amongst others, has given rise to a notification addressed to UNRWA on 3 November 2024 in which Israel deems it has terminated the 1967 Agreement. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3436.8s)]
*  In France's view, the general principle of the consent of the parties concerned by UNRWA's activities must apply in combination with Israel's other international obligations in the occupied Palestinian territory on the one hand and on its own territory on the other hand. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3449.8s)]
*  I will deal with both of these aspects successively because the combination is not identical in both situations. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3469.8s)]
*  First of all, in the occupied Palestinian territory, as a member of the United Nations, Israel's margin of appreciation in banning UNRWA's activities are first of all qualified by its general obligation to cooperate in good faith with the UN. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3477.8s)]
*  This obligation in particular stems from Article 2, Paragraph 5 of the Charter, which provides that the members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present Charter. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3494.8s)]
*  As underlined in the Charter, the implementation of this provision is a prerequisite for the achievement of the aims of the United Nations laid down in Article 1 of the Charter. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3508.8s)]
*  In this connection, it should be recalled that the UN's objective into ALIA is that of achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of a humanitarian character. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3524.8s)]
*  The Court has long held a broad interpretation of the duty of assistance of Member States by applying it also to the actions of the General Assembly, although there is no suggestion that the legal consequence of this duty is to confer a binding force on its recommendations. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3538.8s)]
*  Furthermore, Israel's obligation to cooperate with the UN in the specific framework of humanitarian assistance in Gaza has been recalled on several occasions by the United Nations bodies. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3558.8s)]
*  For example, in its order indicating provisional measures of 28 March 2024, which is still producing effects to this day, your Court ordered Israel to take all necessary and effective measures to ensure without delay, in full cooperation with the United Nations, the unhindered provisions at scale by all concerned, and to ensure that the UN's [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3571.8s)]
*  of urgently needed basic services. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3601.8s)]
*  Israel, therefore, is under an obligation to provide full assistance to the action of the Agency in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which implies, as a minimum, the obligation not to impede its activities. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3607.8s)]
*  Turning now to the territory of Israel, the obligations of Israel vis-à-vis UNRWA in the Occupied Palestinian Territory must be distinguished from those concerning the presence of the Agency on the Israeli territory as such. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3628.8s)]
*  In its advisory opinion relating to the headquarters of the WHO in Egypt, the Court has recognized the sovereign power of decision of a State when it comes to the presence of a UN Agency on its territory. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3648.8s)]
*  The withdrawal of consent of a State to this presence stems from the same sovereign power of decision. Having said this, this power is governed by the obligations owed to the UN by a Member State in the case of a denunciation of the agreement relating to the presence of a UN Agency on its territory. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3664.8s)]
*  These obligations have been described in detail by the Court in its aforementioned opinion. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3684.8s)]
*  This opinion may very well be transposed to the instant case, in part because the 1976 agreement says nothing of the modalities for denouncing it. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3690.8s)]
*  Pursuant to these obligations, Israel and UNRWA must first of all negotiate in good faith the conditions for transferring the Agency's activities outside the Israeli territory. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3702.8s)]
*  Israel must also allow the Agency a reasonable notice period to prepare for its departure and finally grant it and grant its personnel the privileges, the immunities and facilities necessary for a smooth transitional period. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3714.8s)]
*  Furthermore, the exercise by Israel of its power of withdrawing its consent to the presence of UNRWA on its own territory means that it must take into account the consequences of such a decision on the occupied Palestinian territory. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3730.8s)]
*  This decision indeed has consequences in relation to the occupied Palestinian territory within the meaning of the question put to the Court. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3748.8s)]
*  Many of UNRWA's activities in the occupied Palestinian territory are conditional on facilities or authorizations issued by Israel on its own territory, including for any transit to or from the occupied Palestinian territory. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3758.8s)]
*  Doing away with these facilities could concretely and lastingly impede physical access to the occupied Palestinian territory and therefore impede UNRWA's ability to operate there. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3774.8s)]
*  Such consequences would obviously be incompatible with Israel's obligation not to impede the actions of the Agency on the occupied Palestinian territory, as previously discussed. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3786.8s)]
*  This obligation must therefore equally be considered as qualifying the sovereign power of decision of Israel in relation to the presence and activities of UNRWA on its territory. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3798.8s)]
*  I would now like to turn to the obligation to respect the privileges and immunities and the facilities of UNRWA. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3814.8s)]
*  Article 105 of the UN Charter and the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, which I will call General Convention, specifies the privileges, immunities and facilities that Israel must afford to the United Nations and its staff. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3821.8s)]
*  It should be noted that the scope of the Convention, this General Convention, was explicitly extended to the occupied Palestinian territory by the 1967 agreement. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3839.8s)]
*  However, even if this agreement were considered to have been duly denounced, the General Convention would still remain applicable to UNRWA, both in Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3851.8s)]
*  Indeed, if Article 105 of the Charter refers to the territory of each of its members, the provisions of the General Convention, commonly regarded as an amplification of Article 105, are drafted in particularly open terms. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3867.8s)]
*  They refer, for example, to UN property and assets wherever located and by whomsoever held. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3884.8s)]
*  This is in Section 3. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3893.8s)]
*  The object and purpose of the General Convention is to protect the assets and the agents of UN with a view to enabling them to exercise their missions for which these members have been mandated. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3894.8s)]
*  Therefore, it would be indeed paradoxical and even contrary to the object and the purpose of the Convention to deprive the organization of any form of protection on the grounds that it is acting in occupied territory, whereas it is a territory over which it has a particular responsibility itself. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3910.8s)]
*  Consequently, Israel is obliged to apply the General Convention in the territory that it occupies, even in the absence of a special agreement to that effect. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3933.8s)]
*  I will now address successively Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law and then under international human rights law. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3947.8s)]
*  As far as international humanitarian law is concerned, France underscores to begin with that Israel, just like other states, has the obligation to respect and ensure respect of the Geneva Conventions under all circumstances. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3963.8s)]
*  Furthermore, as the Court recalled in its opinion of July 2024, neither the duration nor the unlawfulness of Israel's occupation in Palestine results in releasing the occupying power from its obligation in this respect. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=3980.8s)]
*  So in this context, I will limit my comments to detailing two obligations. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4000.8s)]
*  The first of these obligations is to ensure and to facilitate unhindered supply of basic necessities that are essential to the survival of the civilian population. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4008.8s)]
*  This obligation originates in Article 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a party, and which applies to the whole of the occupied Palestinian territory, including Gaza, as your Court recalled in its opinion last July. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4024.8s)]
*  The question of the application of this provision arises with extreme gravity at the very moment when the current hearings are taking place. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4044.8s)]
*  In Gaza, the entry of trucks delivering humanitarian assistance has been totally suspended since the 2nd of March. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4055.8s)]
*  International organizations that are still present are warning us about the depletion of food stocks and multiple shortages of medicine. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4063.8s)]
*  It should be noted that even in the West Bank, the increasing number of controls is hampering the intervention of human organizations on a daily basis. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4075.8s)]
*  Article 59 imposes on the occupying power two obligations that it cannot be released from if it is established that all or part of the population of the occupied territory is inadequately supplied. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4087.8s)]
*  In this case, the occupying power must, on the one hand, accept humanitarian assistance, because this is a performance obligation. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4103.8s)]
*  Therefore, the occupying power must not refuse any humanitarian assistance. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4115.8s)]
*  On the other hand, the occupying power shall facilitate the relief schemes by all the means at its disposal. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4123.8s)]
*  And by virtue of this obligation of conduct, the occupying power must, in good faith, use all means available to facilitate the delivery of aid that it has accepted. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4131.8s)]
*  Article 59 is worded in such a way that it covers both collective relief provided by states and the aid provided by impartial humanitarian organizations. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4143.8s)]
*  However, it does not provide any restrictive list of relevant organizations in this context. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4155.8s)]
*  In principle, an occupying power therefore has a margin of discretion in the choice of organizations capable of providing the necessary aid. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4163.8s)]
*  In practice, however, the occupying power is obliged to take into account the specific circumstances of the territories that it occupies in order to authorize the use of humanitarian assistance. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4173.8s)]
*  Finally, it should be emphasized that Article 59 contains a safeguard clause allowing the use of humanitarian assistance to the local population. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4187.8s)]
*  That is to say, those that are genuinely capable of providing sufficient aid to supply the local population. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4199.8s)]
*  Finally, it should be emphasized that Article 59 contains a safeguard clause allowing, notably, the occupying power to search the consignments and to regulate their passage according to prescribed times and routes. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4207.8s)]
*  While controls may be justified under this clause, France would like to recall that they cannot lead to preventing humanitarian assistance because that would render Article 59 devoid of substance. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4228.8s)]
*  In the present case, it should be borne in mind that UNRWA is indeed the main provider of humanitarian assistance and essential services in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4245.8s)]
*  Furthermore, France notes that to benefit from these provisions, UNRWA must be an impartial body within the meaning of Article 59. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4259.8s)]
*  And in this context, France has noted the conclusions of the Colonna report on UNRWA's adherence to the principle of neutrality. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4271.8s)]
*  It stresses that the agency is committed to implementing and continuing to apply a zero tolerance policy in this regard. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4281.8s)]
*  These circumstances, coupled with the catastrophic current situation, reduces significantly Israel's margins of discretion in executing its obligation under Article 59. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4291.8s)]
*  Indeed, in the absence of other actors with sufficient capacity to provide adequate supplies effectively to the population, Israel is obliged as occupying power, as long as the situation persists, to authorize and facilitate UNRWA's relief schemes in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4308.8s)]
*  Israel's second obligation as an occupying power is to protect humanitarian workers. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4330.8s)]
*  Indeed, for humanitarian aid to be effectively delivered to civilians, the safety of staff working for the organizations providing that aid must be ensured on the ground. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4339.8s)]
*  And parties to the conflict must conduct hostilities with this protection in mind. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4352.8s)]
*  In this respect, the obligation to protect humanitarian workers can be considered as a corollary of the right of the civilian population to be rescued. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4360.8s)]
*  Under customary international law, the rule according to which humanitarian relief personnel must be respected and protected is also regularly recalled by the Security Council. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4373.8s)]
*  This reminder seems all the more necessary given that, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, on the 22nd of April 2025, at least 418 humanitarian workers have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the outbreak of the war in October 2023. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4386.8s)]
*  In this context, France reiterates its condemnation of Israeli firing on ambulances that killed rescue workers, 15 rescue workers, from the Palestinian Red Crescent, the civil defense and UNRWA. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4402.8s)]
*  I would now like to turn to Israel's obligation to respect international human rights law in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4417.8s)]
*  As the Court has had the occasion to indicate, Israel's obligations derive, among others, from the two covenants of 1966 as well as from the United States and the United Kingdom. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4429.8s)]
*  Moreover, the Court has already recalled that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict or of occupation. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4441.8s)]
*  Indeed, Israel's obligation to provide humanitarian access under international humanitarian law is not limited to the use of humanitarian aid. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4451.8s)]
*  And in view of the serious and imminent risk of famine that Palestine is facing, the Court has already made clear that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict or of occupation. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4461.8s)]
*  Indeed, Israel's obligation to provide humanitarian access under international humanitarian law is supplemented by various other obligations under international human rights law. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4471.8s)]
*  And in view of the serious and imminent risk of famine that Palestinian civilians in Gaza are facing, I would also like to emphasize the right to health and the right to adequate food. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4483.8s)]
*  In accordance with Article 2 of Paragraph 1 of ICESCR, each State Party undertakes, individually and through international assistance and cooperation, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present covenant by all appropriate states. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4493.8s)]
*  In accordance with Article 2 of Paragraph 1 of ICESCR, each State Party undertakes, individually and through international assistance and cooperation, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present covenant by all appropriate states. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4503.8s)]
*  Consequently, if human assistance is in a given situation indispensable to the realization of the two aforementioned rights, a State must consider this aid as a means that is appropriate to their realization, with the meaning of this provision. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4525.8s)]
*  In view of the untenable situation in which the Palestinian civilian population finds itself, there can be no doubt that humanitarian assistance can be qualified as a measure that is conducive to Israel's implementation of its obligation under ICESCR. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4541.8s)]
*  Moreover, since such aid would be essential to the enjoyment by the Palestinians of their fundamental rights, Israel could not restrict access to it without violating the aforementioned obligation. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4559.8s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, it follows from all these elements that Israel is under the obligation, given the critical humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, to authorize and facilitate the presence and activities of humanitarian actors there, in particular those of UNBRA. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4576.8s)]
*  To conclude, France reiterates its appeal to the Israeli authorities to put an end to the dramatic humanitarian situation in Gaza, and to this end, it calls on Israel to cooperate with its international partners, including the United Nations, to ensure, as a matter of urgency, access and security for humanitarian operations in the Gaza Strip and the whole of the occupied territory. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4599.8s)]
*  Thank you very much for your attention. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4627.8s)]
*  I would like to thank the representative of France for his presentation. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4630.8s)]
*  Next delegation to take the floor. The Court will observe a coffee break of 15 minutes. The hearing is suspended. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4639.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4657.8s)]
*  Please be seated. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4687.8s)]
*  The sitting is resumed. I will now invite the next participating delegation, Hungary, to address the Court. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4714.8s)]
*  And I give the floor to Ambassador Jörg Kocic. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4722.8s)]
*  Mr. President, Madam Vice President, Distinguished Members of the Court, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4726.8s)]
*  It is an honor to appear before you today on behalf of Hungary, concerning the case obligations of Israel in relation to the presence and activities of the United Nations, other international organizations, and third states in and in relation to the occupied Palestinian territory. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4737.8s)]
*  Allow us to take this opportunity to express Hungary's commitment to the principal judicial forum of the United Nations that plays a fundamental role in the field of international law. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4755.8s)]
*  During its 80 years long history, the Court has contributed significantly to the strengthening of the rules-based international order. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4768.8s)]
*  The increasing number of states submitting their disputes to the Court's adjudication and the unprecedented workload of the Court reflects the trust of states both in the Court's mandate and in the quality of its work. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4779.8s)]
*  It is of great importance to maintain the confidence in the work of the Court and to abstain from proceedings that may erode that confidence and may create a situation where the Court becomes an actor in an ongoing conflict. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4794.8s)]
*  The Government of Hungary recognizes the importance of the numerous proceedings for an advisory opinion and the potential impact that they have on the prospects for peace and stability in the Middle East. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4812.8s)]
*  When discussing the issue of the advisory opinion proceedings and the question posed to the Court within the request at hand, one must reflect upon the broader political context taking into account the dimensions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4827.8s)]
*  Although the current proceeding aims to address specific issues of international law obligations with regards to a member state of the United Nations, the pattern of politicization of international judicial fora cannot be disregarded when examining this case before the esteemed Court. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4846.8s)]
*  Hungary recalls that in 2004, this esteemed Court clearly stated in its advisory opinion concerning the construction of a wall that the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties on the basis of international law and through the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4866.8s)]
*  Since 2004, this original approach has not changed, although numerous aspects of the political context have shifted. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4894.8s)]
*  The horrendous terrorist attack conducted against Israel by Hamas on 7 October 2023 was a turning point. Hungary strongly condemns these horrific terrorist attacks and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4904.8s)]
*  Since then, Israel has been fighting the terrorist organization Hamas with the aim to prevent such monstrous terrorist attacks ever happening again. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4922.8s)]
*  The evil of terrorists is well shown by the fact that they use innocent civilians as well as education and healthcare facilities, including those associated with the United Nations as shields, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4933.8s)]
*  sparing the lives of both Israeli and Palestinian civilians is of the utmost importance now as well as in the future, with a sustainable peace free of terror. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4948.8s)]
*  The terrorist attack of 7 October 2023 can also be considered a turning point with regards to the intensification of activities in the field of international law in relation to the conflict, including those of the esteemed Court. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4960.8s)]
*  We welcome that the Esteemed Court has called several times for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages held by Hamas and underlined that all parties to the conflict must abide by international humanitarian law and international human rights law. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4977.8s)]
*  We must also note that the proceeding brought before this Esteemed Court may directly contribute to the escalation of the conflict. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=4998.8s)]
*  We are of the view that the present and the former requests for rendering an advisory opinion, as well as the procedure initiated by the Republic of South Africa against the State of Israel, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5007.8s)]
*  may be considered as an interference in an ongoing conflict that does not contribute to the de-escalation and an eventual settlement. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5019.8s)]
*  It is our conviction that politicization of the Court and in fact utilization of the Court creates new dividing lines and continues to fuel tensions. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5030.8s)]
*  Hungary has also welcomed the ceasefire agreements related to the hostilities. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5042.8s)]
*  Unfortunately, the latest ceasefire agreement collapsed in March of this year, leading to an all-consuming high-level conflict. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5048.8s)]
*  In view of this, Hungary stresses the need for a new ceasefire agreement in order to secure the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5056.8s)]
*  and to achieve a lasting resolution of the conflict through negotiations between the parties concerned. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5066.8s)]
*  Bearing in mind this broader context, let me now turn to addressing the three main issues that Hungary considers the most important to highlight, as we have also done so in our written statement. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5075.8s)]
*  Hungary wishes to present issues related to the jurisdiction of the Court, arguing that the Court should use its discretionary power to decline to given opinion. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5087.8s)]
*  With regards to the questions posed to the Esteemed Court, we wish to present arguments based on the established legal framework regarding the agreements on privileges and immunities of the United Nations, with a particular focus on UNRWA. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5097.8s)]
*  Finally, Hungary wishes to reiterate its position concerning the context of the present advisory procedure. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5111.8s)]
*  Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Court, With regard to the first issue, Hungary duly submits that Article 96 of the Charter of the United Nations establishes the possibility for certain organs of the United Nations to be used to [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5119.8s)]
*  initiate advisory proceedings. In addition, it is necessary to take into account Paragraph 1 of Article 65 of the Statute of the Court, according to which the Court may give an advisory opinion on any legal question. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5131.3s)]
*  The Court was unilaterally asked to present a decision on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5146.3s)]
*  In addition, it is necessary to take into account Paragraph 2 of the Statute of the Court, according to which the Court may give an advisory opinion on any legal question. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5153.3s)]
*  The Court was unanimously convinced that Article 65 means that the Court has a discretionary power to decline to give an advisory opinion, even if the conditions of jurisdiction are met. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5160.3s)]
*  The Court has to take into consideration several aspects when elaborating on the question of whether to use its discretionary power to refuse to give an opinion. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5172.3s)]
*  As regards to the limits of the discretionary power, the Court's jurisprudence is consistent in this regard. Only compelling reasons should lead the Court to refuse its opinion. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5183.3s)]
*  With regard to the compelling reasons, in the present case we are of the view that several compelling reasons should be taken into account that individually, as well as cumulatively, may require the Court to refrain from issuing an advisory opinion to the present question. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5195.3s)]
*  First, in 2024, in another advisory opinion proceeding on the legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the Court has already given its opinion with regards to the applicable rules and principles of international law, and expanded on its understanding of Israel's specific legal conditions. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5213.3s)]
*  Second, a contentious proceeding is currently pending before the Court that also touches upon the specific legal conditions of the United Nations. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5243.3s)]
*  Second, a contentious proceeding is currently pending before the Court that also touches upon the specific legal conditions of the United Nations. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5252.3s)]
*  Second, a contentious proceeding is currently pending before the Court that also touches upon the specific obligations of Israel. Giving the advisory opinion might essentially prejudge elements relevant to the case brought against Israel by the Republic of South Africa, thus gravely undermining the integrity of the Court's judicial function. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5261.3s)]
*  Giving the advisory opinion might essentially prejudge elements relevant to the case brought against Israel by the Republic of South Africa, thus gravely undermining the integrity of the Court's judicial function. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5277.3s)]
*  We recall the existing precedent for rejecting a request for an advisory opinion based on compelling reasons. The predecessor of the Court, the Permanent Court of International Justice, declined to issue an advisory opinion on the status of Eastern Karelia, a decision that gave rise to the Eastern Karelia principle. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5289.3s)]
*  This decision and principle has never been overruled. We know that the Court, in its subsequent decisions, has always taken due care to demonstrate the factual differences from the Eastern Karelia case when considering the exercise of its jurisdiction. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5311.3s)]
*  This must lead us to the conclusion that the legal criteria set out in that decision remain authoritative. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5328.3s)]
*  In the decision not to render an advisory opinion, it was stated, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5335.3s)]
*  The question put to the PCIJ was directly related to the main point of the dispute actually pending between two states, so that answering the question would be substantially equivalent to deciding the dispute between the parties. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5340.3s)]
*  The situation in the present case is strikingly similar, as an advisory opinion rendered will unquestionably influence and thus might potentially prejudge determinations to be made in the parallel, contentious proceeding. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5360.3s)]
*  Third, the question submitted to the Court has been formulated in a manner that is blatantly prejudicial and one-sided. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5375.3s)]
*  The question posed by the request is indeed so targeted at Israel that it proceeds on the assumption that Israel has failed to meet its obligations under international law. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5386.3s)]
*  Without any regard to Israel's legitimate security interests and concerns, or to the obligations of the United Nations and third parties in relation to the very subject matter of the question, [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5396.3s)]
*  Replying to the question would inherently entail an affirmation of the statements in the request. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5410.3s)]
*  Last but not least, we emphasize that the request would require the Court to undertake significant factual investigations and make concrete findings on disputed and dynamic matters, which cannot properly be pursued in the framework of advisory proceedings. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5416.3s)]
*  However, the advisory proceedings of the Court are inherently ill-suited for the fact-specific analysis. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5436.3s)]
*  Disregarding such analysis may further hinder the legitimacy of the Court, as the limitations of advisory proceedings should be duly taken into account by the Court when deciding to exercise its jurisdiction. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5444.3s)]
*  Therefore, we reaffirm that an advisory opinion in the present case would be contrary to the common interpretation of compelling reasons and therefore could have a negative impact on the perceived legitimacy of the Court. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5454.3s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5467.3s)]
*  Without prejudice, I would like to ask you to please remain seated. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5471.3s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5475.3s)]
*  Without prejudice, I would like to ask you to please remain seated. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5479.3s)]
*  Without prejudice, I would like to ask you to please remain seated. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5483.3s)]
*  Without prejudice, I would like to ask you to please remain seated. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5487.3s)]
*  Without prejudice, I would like to ask you to please remain seated. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5491.3s)]
*  Members of the United Nations have assumed voluntarily obligations to enable the UN, its specialized agencies, funds and subsidiary bodies to fulfill its principal purpose, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, namely the maintenance of international peace and security and the peaceful settlement of this peace. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5494.3s)]
*  The obligations enabling the fulfillment of these peaceful purposes are as such neither absolute nor unqualified. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5524.3s)]
*  The obligations that members of the UN have taken upon themselves are in the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the 1946 Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5536.3s)]
*  We have to underline the necessity of the joint interpretation of numerous articles of the UN Charter and provisions of the 1946 Convention. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5549.3s)]
*  Article 1 of the Charter states clearly the purposes of the organization, and the introductory sentence of Article 2 makes a clear link to the first article. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5560.3s)]
*  In it, the introductory sentence of Article 2, a distinction is made clearly indicating that obligations arising from Article 1 and 2 are also prescribed for the organization itself. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5571.3s)]
*  Obligations arising from Article 2 must have to be interpreted consistently taking into account the actions of the UN, its specialized agencies and subsidiary bodies as well. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5585.3s)]
*  Thus, when paragraph 5 of Article 2 of the Charter stipulates that all members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present Charter, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5600.3s)]
*  it is clear that a limitation to this obligation is included. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5612.3s)]
*  The organization is obliged to take actions in accordance with the Charter. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5618.3s)]
*  Thus, if actions of the organization were to be found contrary to the Charter, the member in question cannot be expected to give the assistance required by the said article. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5623.3s)]
*  Article 105 of the Charter provides that the organization shall enjoy in the territory of each of its members such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the fulfillment of its purposes. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5633.3s)]
*  This provision is also clearly linked to Article 1 and 2 of the Charter that contain that the fulfillment of the purposes of the organization must be in accordance with the Charter. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5646.3s)]
*  Article 105 also sets a clear limitation in terms of the extent of the privileges and immunities, making it clear that there is a functional approach to be applied. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5658.3s)]
*  The obligation of impartiality in the execution of the functions of the organization can be derived from Articles 100 and 101 of the Charter. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5671.3s)]
*  This obligation is further codified in the staff regulations and rules of the United Nations, including in its core values. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5681.3s)]
*  Moreover, the duty to act impartially constitutes a fundamental principle of the status of international civil servants. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5690.3s)]
*  It must be noted that the 1946 Convention has a specific functional approach as laid down in the preamble of Articles 4 and 5 of the Convention. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5698.3s)]
*  As is customary in international law, privileges and immunities are intended to enable the efficient functioning of actors and services. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5708.3s)]
*  The joint interpretation of Articles of the Charter, the 1946 Convention, and the staff regulations and staff rules, including provisional staff rules of the United Nations, is necessary. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5717.3s)]
*  It can thus be concluded that the United Nations has a specific functional approach to the implementation of the Charter. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5728.3s)]
*  The UN shall act in accordance with the purposes of the Charter, and this creates a limitation to the privileges and immunities provided to the organization in carrying out its functions. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5736.3s)]
*  The UN shall act in accordance with the purposes of the Charter, and this creates a limitation to the privileges and immunities provided to the organization in carrying out its functions. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5746.3s)]
*  As Resolution 79-232 is specifically focused on UNRWA, observations must be made with regards to this subsidiary body established by the UN General Assembly. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5756.3s)]
*  Resolution 302 of 1914, the UN General Assembly, is the first UN resolution to be adopted by the UN General Assembly. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5766.3s)]
*  The UN General Assembly is the first UN resolution to be adopted by the UN General Assembly. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5775.3s)]
*  Resolution 302 of 1949 did not specifically outline UNRWA's privileges and immunities. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5781.3s)]
*  It simply called on States to grant the same privileges and immunities as for its predecessor. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5791.3s)]
*  This clearly means that in order to be able to implement the requirements of the Charter and the 1946 Convention, additional agreements with the host States needed to be concluded. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5797.3s)]
*  This has in fact become the practice concerning other host States of UNRWA. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5809.3s)]
*  With regards to Israel, an exchange of letters was conducted on 14 June 1967 between Israel and UNRWA, the so-called Komei-Mishel-Mor agreement. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5816.3s)]
*  The exchange of letters specifically states that the Israel government will facilitate the task of UNRWA to the best of its ability, subject only to regulations or arrangements which may be necessitated by considerations of military security. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5829.3s)]
*  Thus taking into account the legitimate security concerns of Israel, the exchange of letters also makes specific reference to the 1946 Convention. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5848.3s)]
*  UNRWA's failure to maintain neutrality and the involvement of UNRWA staff members in acts of terror undermined its status as a legitimate aid organization. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5860.3s)]
*  UNRWA's tie to terrorism has become an established fact, particularly following the revelations regarding the involvement of UNRWA employees in the 7 October 2023 attacks. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5873.3s)]
*  Following allegations that at least 19 UNRWA employees participated in the attacks, the United Nations itself also responded, thus acknowledging the necessity to react to the presented evidence of this involvement. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5887.3s)]
*  The involvement of UNRWA staff members in acts of terror constitutes a serious breach of the principle of impartiality and the lack of acting in accordance with the principles enshrined in the UN Charter. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5903.3s)]
*  Furthermore, it is a well-established international norm reflected in multiple conventions and UN resolutions, such as Resolution 1373 of 2001, that organizations are prohibited from providing assistance to terrorist organizations. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5917.3s)]
*  These facts constitute a ground for the abrogation from the Komi-Mission-Mor agreement and justify the limitations due to privileges and immunities granted to UNRWA as a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5931.3s)]
*  Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Court, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5943.3s)]
*  Without prejudice to our firm position that the Court should decline to give the advisory opinion, I now turn to our third and final quorum. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5948.3s)]
*  Further elaborating on the introductory remarks, we would like to refer to the broader context in which the request for the advisory opinion was made. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5957.3s)]
*  It is important to note that Israel withdrew its military presence from the Graz strip in 2005. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5966.3s)]
*  It is the terrorist organization Hamas that has been the target of the Israeli military presence since 2005. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5973.3s)]
*  It is the terrorist organization Hamas that has been the target of the Israeli military presence since 2005. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5983.3s)]
*  It is the terrorist organization Hamas that has been the target of the Israeli military presence since 2005. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5991.3s)]
*  It is the terrorist organization Hamas that has been the target of the Israeli military presence since 2005. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=5998.3s)]
*  It should not be separated from the ongoing conflict, and regrettably it may only be interpreted as an additional avenue within the conflict. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6005.3s)]
*  There is a realistic fear that the Court itself is being used as a battleground. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6014.3s)]
*  As explained above, the involvement of a subsidiary body of the United Nations General Assembly through its staff members in actual acts of terrorism [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6020.3s)]
*  is precisely the reason why there is a need to consider the abrogation of privileges and immunities. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6031.3s)]
*  Unfortunately, the esteemed Court will implicate itself in matters that unduly politicize the esteemed institution of an otherwise strictly judicial character. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6038.3s)]
*  Our concern is not in vain. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6051.3s)]
*  The advisory opinion of 19 July 2024 did in fact become part of the already heated political debate. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6053.3s)]
*  We firmly believe that the peace and long-term solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be achieved through enabling meaningful dialogue between the parties concerned. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6062.3s)]
*  The proceedings before the Court, due to their highly politicized and divisive nature, further escalate the tensions between the parties. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6076.3s)]
*  In conclusion, Hungary has in the present statement put forward four compelling reasons why the Court should not render the advisory opinion, which has been requested of it. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6084.3s)]
*  Without prejudice to this request, Hungary has also put forward arguments with regards to the broader political context, which must be taken into account, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6098.3s)]
*  as well as the legal framework of privileges and immunities of the United Nations and UNRWA. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6108.3s)]
*  Therefore, Hungary respectfully requests the Court to decline providing an advisory opinion. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6114.3s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, this concludes my presentation today. I thank you for your kind attention. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6122.3s)]
*  I thank the representative of Hungary for his presentation. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6128.3s)]
*  I now invite the delegation of Indonesia to address the Court, and I call upon His Excellency, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sigiorno, to take the floor. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6133.3s)]
*  Mr. President, Madam Vice President, Honorable Judges of the Court, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6151.3s)]
*  It is a great honor and privilege for me to appear before you, Honorable Judges, on behalf of the Republic of Indonesia, to defend justice and humanity of the people of Palestine. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6172.3s)]
*  Indonesia is and will always stand with the people of Palestine to attend their independence. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6186.3s)]
*  Our commitment to and profound bond with the Palestinian people is rooted in humanity, that it is their inalienable right to live in peace in their very own homeland. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6194.3s)]
*  Indonesia attaches its utmost importance to the rule of international law and has a strong confidence that the decision of this distinguished Court will guide the General Assembly and its Member States in delivering justice to the persecuted and oppressed Palestinian people. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6209.3s)]
*  Let me stress that while many countries, including Indonesia, clearly express that no country should be above the law, Israel has consistently imposed its nefarious policies and measures in the occupied Palestine territory in utter disrespect to international law. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6231.3s)]
*  Israel continuing unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory and its coercive environment created had made it impossible for the Palestinian people to exercise its basic rights as a nation, the right to self-determination. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6253.3s)]
*  Against this backdrop, Indonesia assumes its moral duty to furnish information on the issues brought by the General Assembly to this Court. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6273.3s)]
*  I will firstly address the issue of jurisdiction, followed by the merit of the case on Israel's obligations as a UN member and as the occupying power. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6285.3s)]
*  Honourable judges, on the jurisdiction, Indonesia asserts that this Court has jurisdiction to provide its opinion requested by the General Assembly under Article 96, Paragraph 1 of the UN Charter and Article 65 of the Court Statute, and that there are no grounds for declining to do so. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6299.3s)]
*  The question raised to this Court is a legal question and within the scope of activities of the General Assembly. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6329.3s)]
*  And this is consistent with the opinion of the Court, such as in the Chagos Advisory Opinion, which stated that the request for an advisory opinion from the Assembly seeking to examine the situation by referencing to international law is a legal question. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6337.3s)]
*  The present request fits into that requirement as the chapeau to the present question makes it unequivocal for scrutinizing Israel's obligation by reference to international law. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6357.3s)]
*  There should be no doubt that this Court has jurisdiction to deliberate over the present request for advisory opinion. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6374.3s)]
*  Mr. President, on the merit of the case, Indonesia submits that Israel, as a member of the UN, bears a general obligation to adhere to its commitments to accept and perform obligations stipulated by the UN Charter in a good faith. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6385.3s)]
*  Israel had accepted such obligations through its declaration accepting obligations under the Charter made on 29 November 1948. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6407.3s)]
*  And Israel's acceptance was a crucial undertaking pursuant to Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Charter to be admitted to the UN membership. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6421.3s)]
*  In its declaration, Israel states that, and I quote, the State of Israel unreservedly accepts the obligations of the United Nations Charter and undertakes to honor them from the day when it becomes a member of the United Nations, end quote. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6434.3s)]
*  The term used in the declaration is unreserved and I do not need to enlighten this Court on the significance of this term. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6458.3s)]
*  Referring to this Court's opinion on the reparation for the injuries, Israel's acceptance of the obligation of the Charter must be strictly observed. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6469.3s)]
*  In this regard, Israel's ongoing violation of and its failure to fulfill its obligation under international laws have raised the question of its suitability to be called a peace-loving state, which is a prerequisite of the UN membership as prescribed in Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Charter. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6483.3s)]
*  I shall explain further that Israel's general obligations under the Charter encompasses obligations to respect the presence of the UN, to facilitate and give every assistance to the UN, as well as to carry out the decisions of the UN Security Council, the judgments and the decisions of this Court. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6507.3s)]
*  By virtue of Security Council's resolutions, Israel also owes those obligations toward other international organizations and third states. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6535.3s)]
*  Honorable Judges, I shall emphasize that Israel is under the obligation to respect the presence of the UN, including UNRWA as the UN body responsible for discharging UN's humanitarian assistance. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6547.3s)]
*  This obligation is provided for in Article 105 of the UN Charter and have been further elaborated in the two UN Conventions on the Privileges and Immunities of the UN, both of which Israel is a State Party. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6567.3s)]
*  These Conventions emphasize that the scope of Israel's obligations is relevant to the present request in relation to the premises, property, assets and funds of the United Nations, to the archives and documents of the UN and to the experts and officials of the UN. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6587.3s)]
*  This is particularly relevant in the present context where the UN has to properly discharge its humanitarian functions in the occupied Palestine territory. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6647.3s)]
*  Having said the above, I wish to submit that Israel's conduct, including its enactment of laws targeting the UNRWA's operation, contradicts Israel's obligations to respect the presence of the UN. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6661.3s)]
*  Honorable Judges, on the obligation of Israel to facilitate and provide every assistance to the UN, as well as other international organizations and third states, I wish to point out several obligations that were imposed to Israel by this Court in its various offices. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6682.3s)]
*  The first is the order of provisional measures in the case of South Africa versus Israel. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6712.3s)]
*  The second, amongst others, are obligations to take all necessary and effective measures to ensure the unhindered provision of the urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to immediately halt military offensive and any other action which may inflict on Palestinian people. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6721.3s)]
*  And to maintain the opening of the Rafah crossing for unhindered provision of the urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6746.3s)]
*  As a matter of law, those obligations imposed by the Court have a binding effect upon Israel by virtue of Article 94, paragraph 1 of the UN Charter. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6761.3s)]
*  This binding effect has also been affirmed by this Court in its 2001 judgment of the Lagran's case. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6778.3s)]
*  I wish to stress that as a failure to perform the above-mentioned obligations would result in the suffering of innocent civilians, particularly the vulnerable groups such as the elderly, women and children, and Israel's non-fulfillment of those obligations constitutes a violation of human rights obligations. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6789.3s)]
*  Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, or ICCPR, establishes that human rights protection does not stop during armed conflict. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6820.3s)]
*  And as this Court determined in its 2004 wall advisory opinion, both international humanitarian law and international human rights law are applicable in times of armed conflict. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6833.3s)]
*  Having pointed out all the above, Indonesia emphasizes that the issue we deliberated is not a matter of political exigency nor it merely a moral inquiry, but one that is grounded in international law upon which Israel is legally bound to discharge its obligations in good faith and without reservation. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6848.3s)]
*  Honorable Judges, I would like now to move to Indonesia's submission regarding Israel's obligation as an occupying power. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6874.3s)]
*  Israel's status as an occupying power in the Palestinian territory, including Gaza, is a matter beyond dispute. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6886.3s)]
*  It has been affirmed by this Court and by countless resolutions of the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6895.3s)]
*  This determination has also been made by the Court's previous advisory opinion of 9 July 2004 and 19 July 2024. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6905.3s)]
*  As an occupying power, Israel's legal obligations extend beyond the general duties owed by all States under international law. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6921.3s)]
*  The Fourth Geneva Convention governs the protection of civilians during times of armed conflict and occupation, and it places specific duties on Israel with respect to the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian population in the OPP. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6933.3s)]
*  The language of this Convention is clear, that Israel is bound to uphold at all times and under all circumstances those obligations. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6957.3s)]
*  It is important to highlight that those obligations are rooted in customary international law and have been consistently reinforced by international legal precedent. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6969.3s)]
*  With regard to this Fourth Geneva Convention, Indonesia respectfully submits that Israel is duty-bound at least to, first, ensure the provision of basic supplies. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=6986.3s)]
*  Second, to accept and facilitate relief schemes. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7002.3s)]
*  Third, maintain medical services and protect humanitarian personnel. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7008.3s)]
*  Fourth, not conduct any forms of collective punishment. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7013.3s)]
*  And fifth, not forcibly transfer and deport civilian population. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7019.3s)]
*  I will address those obligations in turn. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7027.3s)]
*  First, Indonesia submits that Israel is bound to comply with its obligations to ensure basic supplies as provided for under Articles 50 and 55 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7030.3s)]
*  In particular, Israel must ensure that the civilian population in the OPP is provided with essential supplies, including food, medical care and other necessary services. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7048.3s)]
*  And this obligation goes further to underscore the positive duty to maintain special protections for vulnerable groups, including children under 15, expectant mothers and mothers of young children. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7065.3s)]
*  Israel cannot ignore these responsibilities, as they are unequivocal and opposable to Israel as the occupying power. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7084.3s)]
*  Failure to meet this obligation will have grave consequences for the civilian population and constitute a breach of Israel's duties under international law. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7095.3s)]
*  Second, Israel is obliged to agree on relief schemes, especially to fulfill basic necessities as provided under Articles 38, 59 and 62 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7107.3s)]
*  This obligation extends to Israel as the occupying power to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies to establish relief schemes for the provision of food, medical care and other essential services. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7128.3s)]
*  This obligation becomes even more crucial as the civilian population is inadequately supplied. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7145.3s)]
*  The spirit of these provisions is clear. Humanitarian aid must be facilitated by the occupying power, not obstructed. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7153.3s)]
*  It becomes evidently clear that Israel does not fulfill this obligation. Moreover, it played a pivotal part in the unfolding of the biggest humanitarian catastrophe of this decade, if not this century. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7166.3s)]
*  The entire Palestinian territory has been living with persistently low living standards, being denied access to water, food and energy. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7184.3s)]
*  Third, the Geneva Conventions also impose strict obligations on Israel to protect medical facilities, health care personnel and the provision of health care services under Articles 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 30, 47, 53 and 54. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7195.3s)]
*  This includes ensuring that hospitals are not attacked and that medical personnel can carry out their work without interference. These duties are not optional. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7225.3s)]
*  At this juncture, Israel has clearly failed to respect those obligations. Indonesia wishes to highlight the fact that one of these failures was evident in the event of Israel's attack toward the Indonesian hospital in Gaza in 2023. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7246.3s)]
*  This attack was perpetrated against one of the most critical health infrastructure in Gaza, despite the fact that there were patients being treated. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7267.3s)]
*  Fourth, Israel is also duty-bound to not perpetrate collective punishment under Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7279.3s)]
*  Collective punishment is prohibited, and any policy or practice that imposes collective punishment is a violation of these rules. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7293.3s)]
*  Israel must therefore ensure that any measure taken in the OPT does not punish the civilian population collectively. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7303.3s)]
*  The legal principle is clear. Individuals should not suffer for the actions of others. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7313.3s)]
*  However, the reality speaks a horrible truth. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7321.3s)]
*  The imposition of a total siege by Israel, cutting off electricity, water, food and medicine, punishes the entire civilian population of Gaza for the actions of a few. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7326.3s)]
*  Statements by high-ranking Israeli officials that assign collective guilt to an entire nation reinforce the conclusion that such measures are intended to punish civilians indiscriminately. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7340.3s)]
*  This is not only illegal, but morally indefensible. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7358.3s)]
*  Fifth, Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits the transfer or deportation of civilians from the OPT. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7363.3s)]
*  This provision is designed to protect the integrity of the Palestinian population and to ensure that they are not forcibly displaced from their homes. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7374.3s)]
*  Any measures relating to evacuations may only occur for imperative military reasons, and even then must be temporary, non-destructive of the civilian population's rights. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7384.3s)]
*  Israelis must respect this obligation and refrain from engaging in any actions that would lead to the unlawful transfer of civilians from the occupied territory. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7399.3s)]
*  Yet, what we have witnessed in Gaza is the facto policy of permanent dispossession. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7414.3s)]
*  Israel is deliberately conducting a policy of forced mass displacement accompanied by destruction of civilian infrastructure. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7422.3s)]
*  More than 66% of buildings in Gaza were destroyed, and the requirement to return displaced persons to their homes has been rendered meaningless. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7431.3s)]
*  Honorable Judges, Indonesia will also like to add that Israel's obligations as an occupying power are also grounded in international human rights law, particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7442.3s)]
*  an international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights, of which Israel is a state party. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7460.3s)]
*  According to this international covenant, Israel is obliged, among others, to allow and facilitate relief schemes of the UN. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7471.3s)]
*  There are specific obligations to implement this relief scheme, such as the obligation to recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, which is stipulated under Article 11, paragraph 1 of ICE-SCR, [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7481.3s)]
*  the obligation to recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, which is under Article 12, paragraph 1 of the ICE-SCR. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7498.3s)]
*  Furthermore, there are also obligations to respect and ensure the right to liberty and security of persons under Article 9, paragraph 1 of the ICCPR. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7513.3s)]
*  And the obligation to respect and ensure that persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity under Article 10, paragraph 1 of the ICCPR. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7526.3s)]
*  Honorable Judges, finally, I shall also furnish information on the crux of the Palestinian issue, the right to self-determination. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7539.3s)]
*  The Palestinian right to self-determination is the raison d'etre on why the Court should grant the request of the UN General Assembly. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7549.3s)]
*  The questions posed are central to the fulfillment of the Palestinian right to self-determination, a fundamental principle of modern international law as provided in the UN Charter, [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7560.3s)]
*  as well as the Bandung Conference of 1955. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7572.3s)]
*  This Honorable Court has repeatedly and equivocally stated in the 2004 Wall Opinion, as well as the 2024 Legal Consequences Opinion, [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7575.3s)]
*  that Palestinians have the right to self-determination. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7585.3s)]
*  This opinion has also been exemplified by a multitude of resolutions of the United Nations. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7589.3s)]
*  The current reality contradicts all that was envisioned by such right. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7596.3s)]
*  On the ground, the world is now in a state of emergency. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7602.3s)]
*  The world is now in a state of emergency. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7607.3s)]
*  The current reality contradicts all that was envisioned by such right. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7611.3s)]
*  On the ground, the world has vividly witnessed the systematic destruction of civilian infrastructures and hospitals in Gaza, making life unattainable. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7617.3s)]
*  This action actively impedes the dispersal of Palestinian people and hinders their right to determine their very own political, social, economic and cultural status. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7629.3s)]
*  In light of these facts, time and again, Indonesia unwaveringly submits to the Court that Israel shall be under the obligation to fulfill the Palestinian people the right to self-determination. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7645.3s)]
*  Indonesia respectfully appeals to the Honorable Judges that international law must prevail and justice is rightfully delivered. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7662.3s)]
*  This Court opinion will provide much-needed guidance to the international community on how to reinforce the primacy of international law to solve the worst man-made humanitarian catastrophe of the century the Palestinian people continue to endure. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7673.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7696.3s)]
*  I thank the representative of Indonesia for his presentation. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7697.3s)]
*  This concludes this morning's sitting. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7706.3s)]

*  You have the floor. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7895.3s)]
*  Mr. President, before I proceed with my statement, I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to you and your election as the President of the Court. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7914.3s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court, we appear before you today to deliver our oral submission a year after our testament on the legal consequences of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7930.3s)]
*  On July 19, 2024, this respected Court issued an advisory opinion stating that Israel's continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, was illegal and that Israel was under an obligation to bring this unlawful occupation to an end as rapidly as possible. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7946.3s)]
*  On September 19, 2024, UNGWA adopted Resolution 1024 endorsing the advisory opinion of the ICJ. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7972.3s)]
*  This resolution underlined that all States are under an obligation not to recognize as legal the situation arising from the unlawful presence of Israel in the OPT, and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by the continued presence of Israel in OPT. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=7983.3s)]
*  The Court's past orders, provisional measures, and advisory opinions have consistently recorded the unlawful acts of the State of Israel and called on Israel to comply with international law. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8006.3s)]
*  The reason we appear once again before the Court is Israel's sustained breach of its international obligations, which have been further aggravated since October 2023. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8021.3s)]
*  We have been confronted with a war of unprecedented scale against civilians in Gaza. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8035.3s)]
*  The Israeli aggression is spilling over to the West Bank and also to neighboring countries, above all, Lebanon and Syria. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8042.3s)]
*  The international community has gravely failed to halt the Israeli aggression and the loss of tens of thousands of innocent lives in Gaza, mostly women and children. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8052.3s)]
*  Initially, the ceasefire agreement of January 15 brought much-awaited relief for both sides. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8064.3s)]
*  The release of Israeli hostages and more than 1,700 Palestinian detainees, the entry of humanitarian aid, and the reopening of return routes to northern Gaza for the displaced revived Palestinian hopes for an end to this unprecedented suffering. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8072.3s)]
*  Yet, the agreement was later nullified by Israeli noncompliance. Israel once again opted for hostility instead of peace. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8092.3s)]
*  In its current form, the Israeli aggression continues unabated, with grand schemes for the depopulation of Gaza, the annexation of West Bank, the enlargement of illegal settlements, [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8104.3s)]
*  and deportation of 2.4 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza to third countries. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8117.3s)]
*  The people of Gaza are again under a blockade, this time with zero entry of humanitarian aid. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8125.3s)]
*  Collective punishment is enforced in the name of forcing Hamas to return the hostages. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8132.3s)]
*  Israel uses hunger as a weapon. Israel sweeps hundreds of thousands of displaced people from one place to another within minutes of evacuation orders. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8139.3s)]
*  Israel targets houses, hospitals, schools, shelters, camps, safe zones, and all remaining civilian infrastructure. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8151.3s)]
*  Most recently, Israel blew up the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, Gaza's only specialized cancer treatment hospital, as well as adjacent medical school on March 21. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8161.3s)]
*  Where there is no law and force to stop Israel, there is chaos, anarchy, and mass killings amounting to genocide in Gaza, [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8177.3s)]
*  which appears imminent to be replicated in the West Bank without immediate international intervention. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8193.3s)]
*  According to the UN, in the West Bank, more than 50,000 people have been displaced following Israeli military operations against the Jenin camp, [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8201.3s)]
*  which expanded to the Tulkareem, Nour Shems, and Al-Farah camps. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8213.3s)]
*  Israeli Minister of Defense Israel Katz has declared that the military will remain in these camps throughout the coming year, and that the residents will not be allowed to return. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8218.3s)]
*  Mr. President, esteemed members of the Court, UNGA adopted Resolution 79-232 on December 19, 2024, requesting the ICJ to render an advisory opinion based on Article 96 of the UN Charter and Article 65 of the Statute of the Court. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8231.3s)]
*  This resolution sought an advisory opinion from the ICJ to clarify Israel's obligations as an occupying power and as a UN member in relation to the presence and activities of the UN, [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8254.3s)]
*  including its agencies and bodies, other international organizations, and third states in relation to OPT. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8270.3s)]
*  Turkey has submitted a written statement pursuant of the Court's order of February 27, 2025, in accordance with Article 66, paragraph 2 of the Statute of the ICJ. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8279.3s)]
*  Turkey's support for this request underscores its commitment to ensuring that Israel adheres to its international obligations. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8294.3s)]
*  Among these, obligations is the responsibility to allow unimpeded access to humanitarian aid, essential supplies, and basic services for the Palestinian civilian population in the OPT. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8304.3s)]
*  Additionally, Israel is required to facilitate the work of international organizations. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8320.3s)]
*  As a UN member, Israel must act in good faith to fulfill its obligations under the Security Council and UNGA resolutions, [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8326.3s)]
*  which include compliance with the UN Charter and the requirement to implement UN Security Council resolutions. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8336.3s)]
*  Turkey's position is anchored in key international legal instruments, including the UN Charter, international humanitarian law, and international human rights law. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8345.3s)]
*  Several principles are particularly relevant in evaluating Israel's obligations in the OPT. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8358.3s)]
*  Under Articles 2, paragraph 3 and 2, 4 of the UN Charter, all member states, including Israel, are obliged to resolve disputes peacefully and refrain from the threat or use of force. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8366.3s)]
*  These obligations extend to cooperating with the UN in maintaining global peace and security, ensuring that international norms are upheld. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8383.3s)]
*  The privileges and immunities granted to the UN, its agencies, and personnel are essential for ensuring their independent and impartial functioning. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8395.3s)]
*  They stem from the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the UN. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8407.3s)]
*  Turkey underlines their importance, particularly in the context of humanitarian operations in the OPT. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8413.3s)]
*  The inviolability of UN organizations is crucial for their ability to assist the Palestinian refugees effectively. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8421.3s)]
*  Israel, as the occupying power in the OPT, is bound by the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, which stipulates the protection and welfare of civilians under occupation. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8431.3s)]
*  These obligations include ensuring that humanitarian aid reaches the Palestinian population without obstruction, respecting the presence and work of the UN, international organizations, and third states providing aid and upholding the rights of Palestinians under international humanitarian and human rights law. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8444.3s)]
*  Turkey maintains that Israel's compliance with these obligations is necessary for achieving peace and stability in the region. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8467.3s)]
*  The basis for responding to the questions brought before the court for an advisory opinion is the State of Israel's UN membership, which is yet to be accorded to the State of Palestine as per foundational UN resolutions. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8478.3s)]
*  During the 207th plenary meeting of the UN in 1948, Moshe Sharet, the Israeli Foreign Minister of the time, reaffirmed Israel's commitment to the UN principles emphasizing peace, cooperation with neighboring Arab states, and adherence to international obligations. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8495.3s)]
*  Israel assured that its policies align with the UN Charter and relevant resolutions, leading to its recognition as a peace-loving state willing and able to uphold its obligations. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8516.3s)]
*  However, despite its commitments, Israel has not implemented UNGA resolutions, obstructed the establishment of a Palestinian state as outlined in UNGA Resolution 181, and denied refugees their rights under Resolution 194. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8530.3s)]
*  These violations continue to challenge Israel's adherence to its UN obligations, particularly as more countries recognize Palestine as a state. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8549.3s)]
*  Article 4, one of the UN Charter, sets five conditions for membership. Being a state, being peace-loving, accepting the Charter's obligations, having the ability to carry them out, and demonstrating willingness to do so. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8561.3s)]
*  The ICJ affirmed these criteria is an advisory opinion, underscoring that UN membership requires continuous compliance with the Charter's principles. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8579.3s)]
*  Failure to uphold these obligations may lead to accountability under international law. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8591.3s)]
*  UNGA and UN Security Council resolutions stress the need for states to protect UN personnel and facilities, particularly in conflict zones. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8598.3s)]
*  UNGA Resolution 57-337 reaffirmed the safety of UN personnel, while UN Security Council Resolution 1502 condemned attacks against them as violations of international law. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8609.3s)]
*  Additionally, UN Security Resolution 22-86 specifically condemned attacks on medical personnel and facilities during armed conflicts, urging member states to safeguard humanitarian actors. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8626.3s)]
*  Furthermore, the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the UN explicitly guarantees the inviolability of UN premises, archives, and assets, ensuring the organization's ability to operate independently and fulfill its mandate. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8643.3s)]
*  Under the Geneva Conventions, which both Israel and Palestine are parties to, civilians and humanitarian personnel must be protected during conflicts. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8663.3s)]
*  Common Article 3 stipulates humane treatment for those not actively engaged in hostilities, including UN staff. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8675.3s)]
*  The ICJ has ruled that the Geneva Conventions apply to all occupied territories, rejecting Israel's claim that they do not apply the Yure to the OPT. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8684.3s)]
*  Articles 104 and 105 of the UN Charter further reinforce the legal protections afforded to the UN, granting it legal personality and ensuring its ability to function without state interference. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8698.3s)]
*  Israel, as a party to the 1946 Convention, is obliged to respect these provisions. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8716.3s)]
*  Moreover, Article 2.5 of the Charter requires Israel to assist in the UN in its activities rather than to obstruct them. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8723.3s)]
*  Israel, having ratified these provisions without reservations, is legally bound to respect UN premises, personnel, and missions. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8734.3s)]
*  These privileges are granted to ensure that the UN can effectively carry out its mandate. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8745.3s)]
*  Despite these obligations, Israel has restricted access of UN personnel in the OPT, including East Jerusalem. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8753.3s)]
*  The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the OPT has reported Israeli non-cooperation in UN investigations, blocking entry of officials and medical professionals. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8762.3s)]
*  The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the OPT noted that Israel's refusal to grant access to UN investigators may constitute obstruction of justice. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8776.3s)]
*  The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has also reported that Israel denies visas to international staff working in the OPT. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8790.3s)]
*  The ICJ has emphasized the importance of UN immunity and the obligation of states to respect and protect UN personnel. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8800.3s)]
*  The 1949 Advisory Opinion on the Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the Service of the UN affirmed that attacks on UN agents hinder the organization's mission and constitute violations of international law. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8811.3s)]
*  The ICJ recognized the UN's right to claim reparations for injuries suffered by its personnel and upheld the principle of implied powers, [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8828.3s)]
*  which allows the UN to take necessary actions to fulfill its duties, even if not explicitly stated in the Charter. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8840.3s)]
*  As of September 19, 2024, it was reported that Israeli authorities stopped issuing visas to heads and staff of the international NGO community. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8849.3s)]
*  As the UNRWA Commissioner General has underlined, [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8862.3s)]
*  in fact, this came on top of the ongoing entry ban of [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8866.3s)]
*  international media to report freely from inside Gaza at a time when also a number of [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8896.3s)]
*  senior UN officials are not given permission to visit Gaza and or are prevented to travel [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8903.06s)]
*  to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Among these senior UN officials is UN Secretary [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8910.699999999999s)]
*  General Antonio Guterres, who was declared persona non grata by Israel on October 2nd, [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8919.02s)]
*  2024 and banned from entering the country and effectively the OPT. The unilateral decision [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8926.34s)]
*  of the Israeli government to completely stop the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza as of March [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8935.1s)]
*  2nd, 2025 constitutes a form of collective punishment against all civilians in Gaza. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8941.22s)]
*  This action goes against Israel's obligations as the occupying power in Gaza, as outlined in [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8949.099999999999s)]
*  the Fourth Geneva Convention to ensure access to humanitarian assistance. This policy of collective [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8956.939999999999s)]
*  punishment has been reconfirmed in a written statement issued on April 18th, 16th, 2025 by [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8964.22s)]
*  the Minister of Defense of Israel stating that the blockade on aid to Gaza will be maintained in [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8973.019999999999s)]
*  order to exert pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages. Additionally, several Israeli [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8980.34s)]
*  ministers have reiterated their harsh rhetoric calling for the policy of no aid in Gaza until [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8988.1s)]
*  the release of hostages. The Israeli Knesset voted on February 19th, 2025 to approve in a preliminary [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=8995.1s)]
*  reading the amendments to the associations bill. The said amendment stipulates that organizations [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=9004.140000000001s)]
*  receiving any funding from foreign entities and are not budgeted by the State of Israel will be [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=9011.74s)]
*  subject to an 80% tax on every donation received from such a foreign source. The draft bill [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=9018.82s)]
*  essentially aims to cut international donations destined for Palestinians in the OPT. The Israeli [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=9027.3s)]
*  failure to implement its international obligations has been most flagrant in its long-time targeting [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=9037.62s)]
*  of UNRWA and its public services to Palestinian refugees. The agency was established through UNRWA [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=9043.980000000001s)]
*  Resolution 3024 in 1949 as a subsidiary UN body tasked with providing essential services and [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=9052.660000000002s)]

*  requested UNRWA's continued presence in these territories through a Komei-Michel Moore agreement. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=9078.539999999999s)]

*  the capacity to influence effectively the action of persons likely to commit or already committing [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10889.5s)]
*  genocide, end quote. In the Court's view, I quote, a State's obligation to prevent [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10896.7s)]
*  and the corresponding duty to act arise at the instant that the State learns of or should normally [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10903.42s)]
*  have learned of the existence of a serious risk that genocide will be committed. From that moment [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10911.18s)]
*  onwards, if the State has available to it means likely to have a deterrent effect on those [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10919.5s)]
*  suspected of preparing genocide or reasonably suspected of harboring a specific intent, [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10927.66s)]
*  it is under a duty to make such use of these means as the circumstances permit, end quote. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10935.1s)]
*  Mr. President, we ask if there is a State that has not learned of the existence of a serious risk [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10942.460000000001s)]
*  that genocide would be committed in Gaza. What have those States that are in a position to [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10950.94s)]
*  prevent genocide done to fulfill their duty under the Convention? We regard obstruction [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10957.1s)]
*  of humanitarian aid by the Israeli occupying regime as, among others, evidence of genocidal [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10965.18s)]
*  intent and invite the Court to clarify the State's duties to ensure Palestinians' humanitarian access [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10972.220000000001s)]
*  in view of the State's obligation to prevent genocide under the Genocide Convention. [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10980.380000000001s)]
*  Having said that, notwithstanding the present proceedings, the rules are clear. Obligations [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10987.26s)]
*  of States and international organizations are evident. And the international community has [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=10994.460000000001s)]
*  again failed. This is the failure of the United Nations system, the United Nations member states, [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11000.380000000001s)]
*  and that of humanity. This failure has already been registered in the Archives of Human History [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11007.42s)]
*  due to and because of supremacy of politics over rule of law. [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11015.58s)]
*  Lastly, this statement shall in no way employ our recognition of the Israeli regime. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11023.02s)]
*  I thank you, Mr. President. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11029.82s)]
*  I thank the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran for his presentation. [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11034.380000000001s)]
*  And to ratify his presentation and his conclusions, we are raising the list of all [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11074.94s)]
*  obligations of Israel that are subject to the present consultation request. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11080.62s)]
*  Jordan is particularly concerned by the questions that are debated here. [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11087.58s)]
*  The Hashemite kingdom welcomes 2,400,000 Palestinian refugees registered by the UNRWA on its territory. [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11094.220000000001s)]
*  It is the guardian of the holy places, Muslims and Christians of Jerusalem, [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11103.259999999998s)]
*  and is in the first place in providing humanitarian aid to the population of the [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11108.22s)]
*  occupied Palestinian territory. Jordan maintains diplomatic relations with the State of Israel [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11114.46s)]
*  and with the State of Palestine, and opens up without any relapse for peace in the Middle East. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11122.22s)]
*  After the exposition, the situation has dramatically worsened, [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11128.3s)]
*  as a result of the ceasefire, the ban on humanitarian aid to Gaza, [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11136.14s)]
*  and the Israeli actions in Cisjordania, hence the importance and urgency of this consultation request. [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11142.699999999999s)]
*  I will briefly address the issue of exercise through your consultation skills [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11151.82s)]
*  and then examine the impact of the principle of self-determination on the different aspects [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11158.619999999999s)]
*  of the question posed by the General Assembly. My colleagues Eric Bjorgue and Alfredo Crozato [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11164.859999999999s)]
*  will address respectively the UNRWA and humanitarian aid. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11171.82s)]
*  Mr. President, there are decisive reasons for the Court to exercise its consulting skills. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11178.539999999999s)]
*  The United Nations has a permanent responsibility for the Palestinian issue [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11186.699999999999s)]
*  until all these aspects are settled in accordance with international law. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11193.26s)]
*  The arguments against the exercise of your skills are not founded. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11200.779999999999s)]
*  There would be a risk of prejudgment over the existence of a contingent matter, [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11208.3s)]
*  2. that the matter would have already been dealt with by the Court in its opinion of 2024, [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11214.22s)]
*  3. that the matter would be unidirectional and avoid taking into account the context, [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11219.98s)]
*  4. that the Court would not have the necessary elements of the facts. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11226.859999999999s)]
*  It is enough to say here that the South African matter against Israel [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11231.58s)]
*  concerns exclusively the Convention on Genocide, [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11237.98s)]
*  whereas the issue posed here has very high obligations to Israel in a more general context. [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11242.38s)]
*  The issue differs also from the one already answered by the Court in 2024. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11250.38s)]
*  The consultation life of last year provided valuable legal elements [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11257.18s)]
*  to better answer the question posed now, [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11261.58s)]
*  which has not been raised by the General Assembly in its previous request. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11265.42s)]
*  If the issue only refers to the obligations of Israel, [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11272.62s)]
*  it is because it is this State and not others that occupy the Palestinian territory. [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11277.5s)]
*  The question posed has a limited scope. [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11284.460000000001s)]
*  It does not aim to address the whole of issues related to the persistence of occupation [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11287.42s)]
*  or the situation that occurred on October 7, 2023. [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11292.699999999999s)]
*  The General Assembly, just like the Security Council and your own Court, [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11297.18s)]
*  have already demanded the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages detained in Gaza. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11302.3s)]
*  This situation does not disown Israel from the respect of its obligations [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11309.18s)]
*  in virtue of international law. [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11314.859999999999s)]
*  The question posed also concerns the legal obligations [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11317.58s)]
*  and the Court possesses the elements of the facts that allow it to be pronounced. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11322.460000000001s)]
*  If Israel has any grievances against the United Nations or its bodies, [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11329.26s)]
*  the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations [[03:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11333.82s)]
*  gives it the necessary means to resort to them. [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11338.220000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11342.779999999999s)]
*  The principle of self-determination is of vital importance [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11345.82s)]
*  in order to answer each of the elements of the question posed. [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11351.66s)]
*  Indeed, the respect and implementation of these rights by the Palestinian people [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11356.38s)]
*  is the foundation from which all other obligations in combat against Israel [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11362.699999999999s)]
*  must be interpreted and applied. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11369.82s)]
*  It requires that Israel, in the current circumstances and in accordance with its obligation [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11373.74s)]
*  not to interfere in the implementation of these rights, adopt all necessary and effective measures [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11379.66s)]
*  to protect the Palestinian civilian population. [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11386.38s)]
*  Being self-determination a fundamental principle of international law, [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11391.34s)]
*  an erga omnes and an imperative rule of international law, [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11395.98s)]
*  the obligations of Israel are not only for the Palestinian people, [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11401.18s)]
*  but also for the competences of the United Nations in the matter [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11406.94s)]
*  and the international community as a whole. [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11410.94s)]
*  As the first common article of the two human rights pacts says, [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11414.14s)]
*  I quote, [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11420.22s)]
*  In no case can a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence. [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11421.02s)]
*  End of quote. [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11428.54s)]
*  The obligation to respect the rights of the Palestinian people at their disposal [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11430.54s)]
*  does not admit any exception from Israel. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11435.34s)]
*  The powers that the Regulation of the AED and the Geneva Convention 4 [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11440.14s)]
*  recognize as occupying power cannot be applied to the encounter of the imperative right of self-determination. [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11446.539999999999s)]
*  In times of armed conflict, only the rules relating to the protection of the human person [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11456.539999999999s)]
*  have been considered by your Court as untransgressive principles of international law, [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11463.34s)]
*  and the occupier must respect them. [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11471.34s)]
*  As the Court has stated, the powers recognized by occupying power are for temporary occupation, [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11474.619999999999s)]
*  not for prolonged occupation, which constitutes de facto a permanent annexation [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11482.3s)]
*  in violation of the principle of self-determination. [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11488.939999999999s)]
*  Israel has the obligation to cooperate with the United Nations, [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11493.339999999998s)]
*  the other international and state organizations, [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11496.779999999999s)]
*  to put an end to its illicit presence in the occupied Palestinian territory as quickly as possible [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11500.3s)]
*  in order to allow the full exercise of the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination, [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11508.3s)]
*  to stop any activity that prevents this exercise and to act positively for the facilitation. [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11514.46s)]
*  This includes the obligation to respect its territorial integrity, [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11523.74s)]
*  by preventing any form of displacement of its components [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11527.82s)]
*  and by abstaining from any change in the demographic composition of the territory, [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11532.06s)]
*  by assuring and facilitating the supply without hindrance of emergency supplies [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11537.9s)]
*  essential to the survival of the civilian population, [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11545.1s)]
*  as well as basic services and humanitarian aid and development. [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11548.86s)]
*  Israel also has the obligation to respect the permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11555.02s)]
*  on its natural resources and wealth, [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11560.140000000001s)]
*  and not to hinder the diplomatic relations between consulates and other states and international organizations [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11563.34s)]
*  with the Palestinian authorities. [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11572.140000000001s)]
*  The Knesset has adopted a declaration indicating that it opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11576.54s)]
*  and this one day before your court gives its advisory opinion in July 2024. [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11583.1s)]
*  This declaration of the Israeli Parliament is once again in flagrant contradiction [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11591.1s)]
*  with the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination. [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11596.380000000001s)]
*  All the state bodies of Israel have the obligation to respect these rights [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11600.7s)]
*  and not to make obstacles to its implementation. [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11606.060000000001s)]
*  In this sense, the obligation exists to avoid any legislative or administrative disposition [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11609.34s)]
*  to prevent the implementation of the right to self-determination. [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11617.02s)]
*  Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, [[03:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11622.380000000001s)]
*  nothing justifies the maintenance of the Israeli occupation on the Palestinian people [[03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11624.86s)]
*  that prevents them from exercising their right to self-determination. [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11630.460000000001s)]
*  The first relevant obligation is therefore to respect these rights and to stop their violation. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11633.74s)]
*  It is through the strict respect of international law, [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11641.98s)]
*  and not through expansionism, oppression or force, that we can solve the problem. [[03:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11646.3s)]
*  The best guarantee for the peace of all the Middle East is the solution to two states [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11653.58s)]
*  in respect of their independence and security. [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11659.34s)]
*  I thank you for your attention and I ask the President to give the floor to Professor Eilik Björg. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11664.06s)]
*  I thank Professor Cohen. [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11673.02s)]
*  I now invite Professor Eilik Björg to address the court. [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11675.42s)]
*  You have the floor. [[03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11679.26s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the court, [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11681.98s)]
*  it is an honor to appear before you on behalf of Jordan [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11684.7s)]
*  to address Israel's obligations under the law of the United Nations. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11688.78s)]
*  I make four points. [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11694.06s)]
*  First, Israel's obligation to respect the privileges and immunities of the United Nations. [[03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11696.3s)]
*  Second, Israel's obligation to give the United Nations every assistance. [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11703.98s)]
*  Third, Israel's obligation to cooperate with other states. [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11711.42s)]
*  And fourth, Israel's obligations regarding the safety and security of the United Nations. [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11717.5s)]
*  And finally, I would like to address the three main points. [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11723.66s)]
*  First, Israel's obligation to respect the privileges and immunities of the United Nations. [[03:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11727.82s)]
*  Israel recognized in the exchange of letters with UNRWA of 1967 [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11736.94s)]
*  that a number of facilities were essential for the agency to operate effectively. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11742.94s)]
*  The fact that Israel recognized these facilities as essential indicates that they are, [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11750.62s)]
*  pursuant to Article 105 of the Charter, necessary for the fulfillment of UNRWA's purposes. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11758.140000000001s)]
*  The General Assembly has recalled that the agency, [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11768.140000000001s)]
*  as a subsidiary organ of the United Nations, [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11772.78s)]
*  enjoys the benefits of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11777.099999999999s)]
*  The main provisions of the General Convention, anyway, reflect customary international law. [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11785.82s)]
*  I will deal with three of these. [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11793.339999999998s)]
*  The immunity from every form of legal process set forth in Section 2 [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11799.259999999998s)]
*  is essential for the independent exercise by UNRWA of its functions. [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11805.42s)]
*  The inviolability of UNRWA premises set forth in Section 3 guarantees that the premises [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11813.1s)]
*  may not be entered and that the United Nations must itself be permitted to control activities [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11821.18s)]
*  occurring on those premises. [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11828.86s)]
*  All UNRWA officials enjoy immunity and the privileges set forth in Section 18. [[03:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11832.54s)]
*  The provisions relating to officials in the General Convention apply to all staff members, [[03:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11840.94s)]
*  the only exception being those recruited locally and assigned to hourly rates. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11848.060000000001s)]
*  In this case, those criteria are cumulative. [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11854.7s)]
*  The immunity of UNRWA from every form of legal process and the inviolability of its premises [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11862.460000000001s)]
*  are absolute. [[03:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11871.58s)]
*  They may not be qualified or overridden by military expediency or national security. [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11874.78s)]
*  Israel has an absolute obligation to respect the privileges and immunities of the United Nations. [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11885.66s)]
*  Israel self-evidently has an obligation in Teralia not to enter UNRWA premises, [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11893.980000000001s)]
*  not to damage or destroy such premises, not to detain UNRWA staff without charge or trial, [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11903.18s)]
*  and not to seek to extirpate the agency from the occupied Palestinian territory. [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11912.46s)]
*  Second, the text of Article 2, paragraph 5 of the Charter is to the effect that Israel has a [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11921.74s)]
*  general obligation to give every assistance to the United Nations. [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11931.74s)]
*  State practice, including that of Israel itself, confirms this. [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11936.3s)]
*  The contention by Israel that the obligation relates only to enforcement action taken [[03:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11944.619999999999s)]
*  by the Security Council has no basis in international law. [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11951.34s)]
*  The interpretation for which Israel now contends runs counter to the clear wording of Article 2, [[03:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11957.82s)]
*  5 and is inconsistent with the court's interpretation in the reparations case. [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11965.099999999999s)]
*  Israel has an obligation to give UNRWA every assistance in any action it takes, [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11973.74s)]
*  pursuant to the provisions of the Charter. [[03:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11981.259999999998s)]
*  There is a further aspect. [[03:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11986.619999999999s)]
*  Judge Lauterpacht was correct in the voting procedure, where he observed that a state which [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11987.98s)]
*  ignores a series of General Assembly resolutions acts at its peril when a point is reached, [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=11997.34s)]
*  when the cumulative effect of the persistent disregard of the articulate opinion of the [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12008.06s)]
*  organization is such as to foster the conviction that the state in question has become guilty of [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12014.14s)]
*  disloyalty to the principles and purposes of the Charter. [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12021.66s)]
*  Israel is obliged under the Charter to give due consideration in good faith [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12033.099999999999s)]
*  to the resolutions of the General Assembly. [[03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12039.1s)]
*  In whaling in the Antarctic, the court adopted this reasoning in respect of the whaling convention. [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12043.660000000002s)]
*  It applies no less to the Charter. [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12053.42s)]
*  Israel has the obligation to give due regard to General Assembly resolutions, [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12058.78s)]
*  notably those adopted in the 10th Emergency Special Session. [[03:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12064.94s)]
*  Third, one of the purposes of the United Nations is, according to Article 1, paragraph 3 of the [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12071.9s)]
*  Charter, to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of a humanitarian [[03:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12079.26s)]
*  character. As Judge El-Arian observed, the principle of international cooperation in Article 1, [[03:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12087.98s)]
*  paragraph 3, is, like the other purposes and principles of the United Nations, a legal [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12097.74s)]
*  principle, binding on states. The Charter recognizes this in Article 14, to which the court was taken [[03:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12105.74s)]
*  this morning, and which addresses the situation of a violation of the provisions of the present [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12115.5s)]
*  Charter, setting forth the purposes and principles of the United Nations. [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12124.86s)]
*  This obligation to cooperate was developed in greater detail in the Friendly Relations [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12135.1s)]
*  Declaration. Its fourth principle lays down the duty of states to cooperate with one another [[03:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12140.46s)]
*  in accordance with the Charter. [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12148.46s)]
*  Israel's obligations as regards the safety and security of United Nations personnel. [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12156.46s)]
*  Israel has obligations in this regard under the rules of customary international law, [[03:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12163.82s)]
*  codified in the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel. [[03:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12169.34s)]
*  That this Convention codifies customary international law is evident from the fact that [[03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12177.82s)]
*  the General Assembly adopted it by consensus. Notable in this regard is Israel's obligation [[03:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12184.779999999999s)]
*  to facilitate the unimpeded transit of UNRWA and other United Nations personnel across its own territory. [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12193.18s)]
*  This obligation includes unimpeded transit from one part of the occupied Palestinian territory to another. [[03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12205.18s)]
*  Israel also has the obligation to ensure the safety and security of United Nations personnel, [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12215.18s)]
*  to release detained personnel and to penalise crimes against them. [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12223.18s)]
*  Israel has, finally, the obligation not to make UNRWA or other United Nations personnel the object of an attack, [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12231.18s)]
*  or any other action that prevents them from discharging their mandate. [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12241.18s)]
*  That, Mr. President, members of the Court, concludes my presentation. I thank you and ask that you invite Professor Alfredo Crosato to the podium. [[03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12251.18s)]
*  I thank Professor Bjorgel. I now give the floor to Professor Alfredo Crosato. [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12263.18s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Court. It is an honour to appear before you on behalf of Jordan. [[03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12267.18s)]
*  I shall now focus on Israel's obligations concerning humanitarian relief in Gaza. [[03:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12273.18s)]
*  These arise from a variety of sources that include the Law of Occupation, Human Rights Law, [[03:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12279.18s)]
*  the Law on the Protection of Persons in the Event of Disasters, and these courts' orders on provisional measures. [[03:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12283.18s)]
*  All told, international law requires Israel to provide humanitarian relief to the civilian population of Gaza, [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12290.18s)]
*  a territory which is at present far from adequately supplied. Indeed, a humanitarian catastrophe is already unfolding. [[03:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12297.18s)]
*  Where Israel is unable or unwilling to fulfil its duties, it must facilitate relief schemes undertaken by third parties. [[03:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12305.18s)]
*  Time is of the essence, and Israel must do so swiftly and in cooperation with the third parties involved in good faith. [[03:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12315.18s)]
*  Let me start with the Law of Occupation and two general remarks. [[03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12322.18s)]
*  First, the Court recently reaffirmed that the Law of Occupation applies to the entire Palestinian territory, including Gaza. [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12326.18s)]
*  That situation has not changed, and any contention that Israel does not currently occupy Gaza must be rejected. [[03:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12333.18s)]
*  Israel has not been liberated from its obligations as an occupying power. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12341.18s)]
*  Second, the scope of Israel's claimed authority as an occupying power. [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12345.18s)]
*  Whatever the situation, international law does not confer such an authority or discretion allowing a state to circumvent obligations aimed at ensuring the survival of a civilian population. [[03:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12350.18s)]
*  It is impossible to conceive a good faith interpretation... [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12363.18s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt you, but could you speak more slowly? [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12367.18s)]
*  Sure, thank you very much. [[03:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12370.18s)]
*  It is impossible to conceive a good faith interpretation of the Law of Occupation, [[03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12371.18s)]
*  consistent with its object and purpose, that would result in widespread suffering of civilians and destruction of civilian objects. [[03:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12376.18s)]
*  The Court has determined that Israel's occupation is illegal. [[03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12384.18s)]
*  Its policies and practices, I quote, [[03:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12390.18s)]
*  manifest an intention to create a permanent and irreversible Israeli presence in the OPT, [[03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12392.18s)]
*  breaching the provision of acquisition of territory by force and the principle of self-determination. [[03:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12398.18s)]
*  You also found that Israel has engaged in a sustained abuse of its position as an occupying power. [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12404.18s)]
*  Any territorial control still exercised by Israel until it has withdrawn must therefore ensure the well-being of Palestinians and respect for the right to self-determination. [[03:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12411.18s)]
*  Moreover, since Israel has been abusing the Law of Occupation, it cannot claim broad rights or powers arising from it. [[03:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12422.18s)]
*  This is a core legal consequence of the general principle prohibiting the abuse of rights. [[03:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12431.18s)]
*  Israel's relevant obligations are primarily found in the Fourth Geneva Convention and customary international law. [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12437.18s)]
*  As long as Israel occupies Gaza, the customary rule reflected in Article 43 of the Hague regulations requires it to act for the benefit of the local population. [[03:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12443.18s)]
*  This is a general guiding principle and fundamental duty of Israel. [[03:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12454.18s)]
*  In addition, Article 55 of the Fourth Geneva Convention requires Israel, to the fullest extent of the means available to it, [[03:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12459.18s)]
*  to ensure the food and medical supplies of the population, including by bringing in the necessary foodstuffs, medical stores and other articles, [[03:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12467.18s)]
*  if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate. [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12475.18s)]
*  Article 69 of the Additional Protocol 1, which reflects custom, expands the range of supplies that must be provided. [[03:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12479.18s)]
*  Under Article 56, Israel must ensure and maintain the medical and hospital establishments and services, public health and hygiene, [[03:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12486.18s)]
*  and allow medical personnel of all categories to carry out their duties. [[03:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12494.18s)]
*  Article 50 mandates the facilitation of the proper working of all institutions devoted to the care and education of children. [[03:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12499.18s)]
*  The Convention also contains key provisions concerning third parties when the Occupy Empower does not or cannot fulfill the obligations I just mentioned. [[03:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12508.18s)]
*  Where Israel fails to act, civilians are not left to their own fate without more. [[03:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12517.18s)]
*  Article 59 stipulates that if the occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the Occupy Empower shall agree to relieve schemes on behalf of the population [[03:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12523.18s)]
*  and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal. [[03:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12533.18s)]
*  These schemes may be undertaken by states or by impartial humanitarian organizations, [[03:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12537.18s)]
*  and shall consist in particular of the provision of consignments, of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. [[03:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12543.18s)]
*  These are erroneous obligations of both result and conduct. [[03:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12550.18s)]
*  Israel cannot oppose those relief schemes. [[03:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12554.18s)]
*  Agreement is the required outcome, no exception. [[03:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12557.18s)]
*  Israel must also facilitate those schemes using all available means. [[03:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12561.18s)]
*  This is a high standard of conduct consistent with the gravity of the situation that Article 59 addresses, [[03:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12567.18s)]
*  prohibiting Israel from actions or omissions that may hinder humanitarian relief. [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12574.18s)]
*  Article 59 must be read together with Article 1, [[03:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12580.18s)]
*  which contains states undertaking to respect and to ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances. [[03:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12585.18s)]
*  Every state party must ensure compliance by Israel with its obligations, while respecting, of course, other rules of international law. [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12591.18s)]
*  Article 59 is a form of application of Article 1, a means for states to ensure compliance with Israel's relief obligations. [[03:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12598.18s)]
*  When states seek to provide relief schemes, individually or jointly, [[03:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12613.18s)]
*  they do not do so only by virtue of an option envisaged by Article 59. [[03:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12617.18s)]
*  They have an obligation to act of their own. [[03:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12622.18s)]
*  Article 59 may require practical arrangements for the orderly supply of humanitarian relief. [[03:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12625.18s)]
*  Insofar as these are needed, Israel must consider them in good faith, bearing in mind the needs of civilians. [[03:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12632.18s)]
*  If the arbitrary or unjustified delays would not be consistent with Article 59, they would defeat the purpose of the obligation. [[03:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12639.18s)]
*  In the present circumstances, Jordan, like virtually all participants, considers that Gaza is inadequately supplied, [[03:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12646.18s)]
*  this is manifest, and that Israel's obligations have been triggered. [[03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12653.18s)]
*  Jordan is also of the firm view that UNRWA meets the principles of impartiality and neutrality, [[03:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12659.18s)]
*  as confirmed recently by the Colona report and the OIOS investigations. [[03:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12665.18s)]
*  Furthermore, there is no other actor that could realistically replace the agency and its mandates to provide and distribute humanitarian relief and other services in Gaza. [[03:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12670.18s)]
*  Israel must therefore allow UNRWA to continue its humanitarian operations and cease all conduct which prevents the agency from doing so. [[03:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12683.18s)]
*  There is no other way to give full effect to Article 59 of the Convention in the circumstances. [[03:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12691.18s)]
*  Israel's obligations, as we noted, also arise from other sources. [[03:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12698.18s)]
*  These are separate obligations which complement and are as stringent as the law of occupation. [[03:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12702.18s)]
*  I will address a few key ones. [[03:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12708.18s)]
*  Israel must ensure the right to life of Palestinians consistent with the ICCPR and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which apply in Gaza. [[03:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12711.18s)]
*  This includes a positive duty to take action to prevent foreseeable harm or injury that may result in arbitrary deprivation of life. [[03:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12720.18s)]
*  In the present context, such risk is not only foreseeable but already materialized. [[03:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12729.18s)]
*  To avoid further loss of life, Israel must strictly respect the fundamental principles of IHL and facilitate humanitarian relief in Gaza. [[03:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12735.18s)]
*  The Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights requires Israel to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living, [[03:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12745.18s)]
*  the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and the right to education. [[03:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12752.18s)]
*  These rights are at risk of being altogether denied to Palestinians in Gaza, [[03:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12759.18s)]
*  and Israel must take immediate action and allow the supply of relief to prevent such denial. [[03:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12764.18s)]
*  Jordan has also referred to the law on the protection of persons in the event of disasters, recently codified by the ILC. [[03:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12772.18s)]
*  The obligations in this area are closely linked to those under human rights law, [[03:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12780.18s)]
*  and require Israel, among others, to cooperate in good faith with third parties, to facilitate humanitarian assistance, and not to arbitrarily withhold consent to such assistance. [[03:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12785.18s)]
*  Finally, Israel has obligations arising from the interim measures in the South Africa-Israel case. [[03:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12797.18s)]
*  It must take all necessary and effective measures to enable the unhindered provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance in Gaza. [[03:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12803.18s)]
*  It must do so as a matter of urgency, without delay, and in cooperation with the United Nations. [[03:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12812.18s)]
*  The obligations we have addressed should be interpreted and applied in a systemic manner, [[03:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12820.18s)]
*  and against the background of the principle of self-determination, which is of paramount importance. [[03:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12825.18s)]
*  Time, again, is of the essence, and Israel must perform its duties swiftly and in good faith. [[03:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12832.18s)]
*  The horror that Palestinian civilians are undergoing in Gaza must stop. [[03:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12839.18s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, this concludes my presentation and Jordan's oral submissions. [[03:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12845.18s)]
*  We thank you for your kind attention in these important proceedings. [[03:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12849.18s)]
*  I thank the representatives of Jordan for their presentation. [[03:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12853.18s)]
*  Before I invite the next delegation to take the floor, the Court will observe a coffee break of 15 minutes. [[03:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12858.18s)]
*  The hearing is suspended. [[03:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12866.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12879.18s)]
*  Please be seated. [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12909.18s)]
*  The sitting is resumed. [[03:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12936.18s)]
*  I now invite the next participating delegation, Kuwait, to address the Court, [[03:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12950.18s)]
*  and I call His Excellency Ambassador Abdullah Suleiman Al-Shahin to the podium. [[03:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12956.18s)]
*  You have the floor, sir. [[03:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12963.18s)]
*  Bismillah, Rahman, Rahim. [[03:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12978.18s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court, [[03:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12980.18s)]
*  I have the honor to address this esteemed Court today on behalf of the State of Kuwait, [[03:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12984.18s)]
*  fully conscious of the urgency and gravity of the issues before us. [[03:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12989.18s)]
*  In recognition of the limited time available, [[03:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12994.18s)]
*  Kuwait will concisely address the essential matters clearly setting forth its position. [[03:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=12997.18s)]
*  Regrettably, we meet at a time marked by a grave humanitarian crisis [[03:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13004.18s)]
*  and mounting dangers in the occupied Palestinian territory, [[03:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13009.18s)]
*  where the unfolding tragedy poses a direct challenge to the conscience of the international community [[03:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13013.18s)]
*  and to the very foundations of international law. [[03:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13020.18s)]
*  The humanitarian situation in the OPT has deteriorated alarmingly, [[03:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13023.18s)]
*  compelling the urgent attention of this Court. [[03:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13028.18s)]
*  The recent escalation of military actions by Israel, [[03:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13032.18s)]
*  hereafter referred to as the occupying power, [[03:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13035.18s)]
*  has tragically intensified the suffering of the Palestinian civilian population. [[03:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13039.18s)]
*  Civilians continue to endure harm, exacerbated by systemic obstruction of humanitarian aid. [[03:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13045.18s)]
*  This crisis is deepened further by recent legislative measures [[03:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13052.18s)]
*  that severely restrict and jeopardize the critical humanitarian role [[03:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13057.18s)]
*  provided by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees in the Near East. [[03:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13061.18s)]
*  Mr. President, Kuwait stands unwaveringly committed to the primacy of international law [[03:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13068.18s)]
*  as the fundamental mechanism through which the legitimate rights [[03:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13075.18s)]
*  and aspirations of the brotherly Palestinian people can be secured. [[03:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13079.18s)]
*  International law remains our most potent instrument for achieving justice, accountability, [[03:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13084.18s)]
*  and lasting peace in the region. [[03:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13091.18s)]
*  His principles have been recently articulated by the representative of His Highness the Emir of the State of Kuwait, [[03:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13094.18s)]
*  Sheikh Michelle Ahmed Al-Jabir Al-Subah, [[03:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13100.18s)]
*  His Highness the Crown Prince Sheikh Subah Khalid Al-Hamad Al-Subah [[03:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13103.18s)]
*  during Kuwait's address at the Extraordinary Arab Summit in Cairo. [[03:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13107.18s)]
*  Excuse me again, Your Honour, but please speak more slowly. [[03:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13112.18s)]
*  Sorry? [[03:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13116.18s)]
*  Please speak more slowly. [[03:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13117.18s)]
*  Slowly. [[03:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13119.18s)]
*  That address emphasized the imperative necessity of holding the occupying power accountable [[03:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13120.18s)]
*  through the mechanisms of international law, including international humanitarian law, [[03:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13127.18s)]
*  resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Human Rights Council, [[03:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13132.18s)]
*  and the International Court of Justice. [[03:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13138.18s)]
*  In February 2024, Kuwait, along with several states, stood before this Honourable Court, [[03:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13141.18s)]
*  condemning the occupying powers prolonged in legal occupation of Palestinian lands. [[03:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13148.18s)]
*  This Court, in its Seminole Advisory Opinion, issued on 19 July 2024, [[03:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13154.18s)]
*  unequivocally affirmed that the occupying powers' occupation is unlawful and must end as rapidly as possible. [[03:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13161.18s)]
*  Yet, the relentless continuation of military operations, [[03:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13171.18s)]
*  including devastating aerial strikes on Gaza since 18 March 2025, [[03:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13175.18s)]
*  stands as a distressing testament to this ongoing injustice. [[03:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13181.18s)]
*  In parallel, the occupying powers' actions have severely imperiled the vital humanitarian mission of UNRWA. [[03:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13187.18s)]
*  Recent legislative actions enacted by the occupying power in January 2025 [[03:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13196.18s)]
*  have severely curtailed UNRWA's capacity to function, [[03:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13202.18s)]
*  critically undermining its ability to deliver indispensable support and services to Palestinian civilians. [[03:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13206.18s)]
*  Kuwait's oral submission is structured thematically to facilitate the Court's careful consideration of the applicable legal frameworks. [[03:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13215.18s)]
*  I will begin by confirming the Court's jurisdiction and clarifying the scope of the question and relevant law. [[03:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13224.18s)]
*  I will then highlight the occupying powers' violations of the privileges and immunities of the UN and UNRWA. [[03:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13232.18s)]
*  Finally, I will address the breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law. [[03:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13240.18s)]
*  This structured approach is intended to provide the Court with a clear and coherent legal foundation [[03:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13246.18s)]
*  for its advisory opinion. [[03:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13253.18s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, [[03:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13255.18s)]
*  this inquiry is urgent and essential. [[03:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13258.18s)]
*  The Court's authoritative guidance is vital to relieving immediate suffering and reaffirming international law. [[03:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13262.18s)]
*  Mr. President, Honourable Members of the Court, [[03:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13270.18s)]
*  with your permission, I shall now address briefly, but with the requisite care, [[03:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13273.18s)]
*  the question of whether the Court possesses jurisdiction in the present advisory proceedings [[03:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13279.18s)]
*  and whether it should exercise that jurisdiction. [[03:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13285.18s)]
*  The legal basis is beyond doubt. [[03:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13289.18s)]
*  The Court's jurisprudence is clear, and the urgency of the matter before you could not be greater. [[03:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13292.18s)]
*  The advisory jurisdiction of this Court is grounded in two foundational provisions. [[03:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13299.18s)]
*  Article 96, one of the UN Charter, and Article 65, one of the Statutes of the Court. [[03:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13305.18s)]
*  Article 96 authorizes the UN General Assembly to request an advisory opinion from this Court on any legal question. [[03:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13313.18s)]
*  Article 65, in turn, enables the Court to respond to such requests, [[03:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13322.18s)]
*  provided they are made by an organ duly authorized under the UN Charter. [[03:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13328.18s)]
*  These two provisions form the legal cornerstone of the Court's advisory function. [[03:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13334.18s)]
*  They leave no room for doubt. [[03:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13340.18s)]
*  The request presently before the Court originates from the General Assembly. [[03:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13344.18s)]
*  Moreover, the question it poses is unmistakably legal. [[03:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13349.18s)]
*  Specifically, it asks whether that conduct of the occupying power complies with the rules and principles of international law, [[03:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13354.18s)]
*  including international humanitarian law, international human rights law, [[03:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13362.18s)]
*  and the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the UN. [[03:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13367.18s)]
*  It directly concerns the UN, its agencies, and other international actors, [[03:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13372.18s)]
*  as it relates to their operations and the protection of their personnel in and in relation to the OPT. [[03:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13378.18s)]
*  The great minority of participants in these proceedings have suggested that the political context surrounding this request [[03:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13387.18s)]
*  undermines its legal character and the clarity of the question. [[03:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13395.18s)]
*  But this Court has long and consistently held otherwise. [[03:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13400.18s)]
*  As reaffirmed in the Court's jurisprudence, the presence of political aspects in a question does not deprive it of its character as a legal question. [[03:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13405.18s)]
*  Indeed, this Court was created precisely to answer legal questions that arise even and especially within politically sensitive contexts. [[03:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13415.18s)]
*  It is true that Article 65 of the Statutes uses permissive languages. [[03:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13427.18s)]
*  The Court may render an advisory opinion. [[03:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13432.18s)]
*  That implies discretion. [[03:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13435.18s)]
*  But the Court's own jurisprudence makes clear that this discretion is not absolute. [[03:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13438.18s)]
*  The Court has emphasized that responding to such requests forms part of its participation in the work of the UN, [[03:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13444.18s)]
*  and that it should not, in principle, refuse to respond unless compelling or, in the Court's own language, decisive reasons are present. [[03:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13452.18s)]
*  In this context, it is essential to recall that the General Assembly's request does not invoke Section 30 of the 1946 Convention, [[03:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13464.18s)]
*  which governs the settlement of disputes between the UN and Member States. [[03:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13474.18s)]
*  As explained in Kuwait's written statement, the request does not concern such a dispute. [[03:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13479.18s)]
*  Rather, it seeks clarification of the occupying power's legal obligations, particularly as they relate to the presence and activities of the UN [[03:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13485.18s)]
*  and other international actors in and in relation to the OPT. [[03:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13495.18s)]
*  Finally, it shall be made clear that rendering an advisory opinion could in no way compromise the Court's judicial integrity in pending cases against the occupying power before this Court. [[03:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13501.18s)]
*  Kuwait categorically rejects this view. [[03:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13515.18s)]
*  The Court's advisory and contentious functions are clearly distinct. [[03:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13519.18s)]
*  Independence of a related case cannot deprive the General Assembly of its right to request an advisory opinion. [[03:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13524.18s)]
*  Also, in the present advisory proceedings, the divergence of legal views specifically concerns the actions of the UN and its organs [[03:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13532.18s)]
*  in relation to the occupying power's obligations as UN member and as the occupying power in the OPT. [[03:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13542.18s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, the question is legal, and it falls squarely within the ambit of Articles 65 and 96. [[03:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13551.18s)]
*  Nothing prevents the Court from rendering an advisory opinion to the contrary. [[03:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13562.18s)]
*  The gravity of the situation makes the Court's guidance not only appropriate, but indispensable. [[03:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13567.18s)]
*  Excuse me, the interpreter is having a problem, so please speak slowly. [[03:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13574.18s)]
*  Mr. President, I will now address the scope of the questions submitted by the General Assembly and the relevant legal framework governing the Court's analysis. [[03:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13583.18s)]
*  The present request is distinct from last year's advisory opinion, focusing on specific legal questions. [[03:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13594.18s)]
*  The General Assembly does not seek a comprehensive account of all obligations of the occupying power as a UN member, [[03:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13602.18s)]
*  but rather an opinion on its duties concerning the presence and activities of the UN, its organs, agencies such as ANUWA, [[03:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13611.18s)]
*  other international organizations, and third states and in relation to the OPT. [[03:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13621.18s)]
*  This includes measures such as legislation aimed at banning ANUWA. [[03:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13628.18s)]
*  General Assembly Resolution 79-232 recalls the occupying power's obligation to ensure unrestricted humanitarian assistance, [[03:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13635.18s)]
*  essential services, and support for the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. [[03:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13647.18s)]
*  Paragraph 10 of the resolution establishes a coherent legal framework referencing relevant sources, [[03:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13654.18s)]
*  the UN Charter, international humanitarian and human rights law, the law governing privileges and immunities of international organizations, [[03:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13662.18s)]
*  pertinent resolutions of the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council, [[03:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13672.18s)]
*  and this Court's advisory opinions from 2004 and 2024. [[03:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13679.18s)]
*  In Kuwait's view, this list is explicitly non-exhaustive. [[03:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13686.18s)]
*  As underlined by at least 25 participants in these proceedings, [[03:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13692.18s)]
*  it includes the Convention on the Rights of the Child to which the occupying power is a party, [[03:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13697.18s)]
*  given the disproportionate and devastating impact of the conflict on Palestinian children, [[03:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13704.18s)]
*  as well as the Court's binding provision measures in the genocide case wrote by South Africa against the occupying power, [[03:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13710.18s)]
*  a valid point highlighted by a great number of participants. [[03:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13719.18s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, [[03:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13726.18s)]
*  I shall now turn to the legal obligations incumbent upon the occupying power concerning the privileges and immunities of the UN, [[03:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13730.18s)]
*  with particular attention to Anwar. [[03:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13740.18s)]
*  The privileges and immunities enjoyed by the UN are firmly grounded in Article 105 of the UN Charter. [[03:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13743.18s)]
*  These privileges and immunities constitute essential protections, [[03:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13752.18s)]
*  enabling the UN to perform its mandate independently and effectively, free from interference. [[03:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13757.18s)]
*  Importantly, these protections apply not only to the UN as an entity, [[03:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13765.18s)]
*  but extend comprehensively to its representatives, officials, personnel, and assets. [[03:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13772.18s)]
*  Consequently, the occupying power bears a clear and unequivocal legal obligation to uphold and respect these privileges and immunities. [[03:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13780.18s)]
*  This obligation is explicitly reinforced and codified by the 1946 Convention, [[03:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13790.18s)]
*  which remains fully applicable and binding upon the occupying power due to its ongoing membership in the UN. [[03:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13798.18s)]
*  The 1946 Convention establishes a comprehensive legal framework to safeguard the functioning of the organization. [[03:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13807.18s)]
*  It guarantees inter-alien, the immunity of UN property from interference, the inviolability of its premises, [[03:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13815.18s)]
*  the freedom of movement of officials and expert on mission, and legal immunity for acts performed in unofficial capacity. [[03:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13825.18s)]
*  These protections extend equally to the UN specialized agencies and programs, including UNRWA. [[03:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13834.18s)]
*  Significantly, in the 1967 exchange of letters between UNRWA and the occupying power, [[03:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13842.18s)]
*  the latter expressly undertook to fully cooperate with UNRWA's humanitarian activities in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. [[03:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13850.18s)]
*  These privileges and immunities impose a binding obligation on the occupying power to allow UNRWA to function fully in its territory and in the OPT. [[03:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13861.18s)]
*  They cannot be unilaterally revoked. [[03:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13872.18s)]
*  Furthermore, Article 103 of the UN Charter ensures that obligations under the Charter prevail over any conflicting international norms. [[03:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13875.18s)]
*  Accordingly, and as Quaid and 20 other participants have underscored, [[03:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13887.18s)]
*  justification based on military necessity or national security cannot override the privileges and immunities accorded to the UN. [[03:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13893.18s)]
*  Despite these obligations, the occupying power has passed legislation that came into force in January 2025, [[03:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13905.18s)]
*  explicitly prohibiting UNRWA's operations and banning official contact with its representatives. [[03:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13914.18s)]
*  This law severely hinders UNRWA's capacity to operate in the OPT. [[03:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13921.18s)]
*  Not only by prohibiting engagement, but by obstructing the issuance of permits required for personnel movement and aid delivery. [[03:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13927.18s)]
*  Such measures constitute a clear violation of the occupying power's obligations under international law. [[03:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13937.18s)]
*  The inviolability of UN premises, the cornerstone of both Article 105 of the UN Charter and Section 3 of the 1946 Convention, [[03:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13947.18s)]
*  prohibits any forced entry, interference or attack on UN facilities. [[03:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13957.18s)]
*  This protection extends beyond physical inviolability to include immunity from domestic legal jurisdiction. [[03:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13964.18s)]
*  Yet, the occupying power has repeatedly violated this principle by targeting UN humanitarian facilities with military strikes and clear breach of its obligations. [[03:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13973.18s)]
*  In addition, the freedom of movement of UN officials is enshrined in Article 1 of the 1946 Convention. [[03:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13987.18s)]
*  These provisions prohibit immigration restrictions or administrative barriers that would obstruct UN operations. [[03:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=13996.18s)]
*  Nevertheless, the occupying power has denied entry to UN officials, barred the UN Secretary General, and declared senior UN personnel persona non grata. [[03:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14004.18s)]
*  These actions not only obstruct the UN's functions, but also violate both treaty-based and customary international law. [[03:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14017.18s)]
*  Mr. President, UN officials and experts on mission also enjoy functional immunity for acts performed in the course of their official duties. [[03:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14026.18s)]
*  This immunity includes protection from legal proceedings and procedural safeguards, such as the right to visitation and fair treatment in case of detention. [[03:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14037.18s)]
*  However, the occupying power has detained UN personnel for statements made and acts performed in their official capacities, violating Section 18 of the 1946 Convention. [[03:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14049.18s)]
*  In particular, the arbitrary detention of UNO staff has denied the UN the ability to communicate with or visit its personnel, thereby undermining their independence. [[03:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14064.18s)]
*  Quaid submits that the occupying power has consistently violated its international legal obligations relating to the privileges and immunities of the UN. [[03:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14078.18s)]
*  Such conduct is not merely unlawful. It endangers the effective functioning of the UN within and in relation to the OPT. [[03:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14091.18s)]
*  Quaid therefore respectfully calls upon the Court to reaffirm the inviolability of the UN and its agencies and to clarify the legal consequences arising from the occupying power's persistent noncompliance. [[03:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14101.18s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, I will now turn to the obligations of the occupying power under international humanitarian law and international human rights law as they apply to the OPT. [[03:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14119.18s)]
*  The Court has consistently reaffirmed that international humanitarian law applies to the OPT. [[03:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14133.18s)]
*  In its 2024 advisory opinions, the Court confirmed the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war and the 1907 Hague regulations as binding legal frameworks. [[03:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14141.18s)]
*  The occupying power, by virtue of its continued military presence and effective control over the territory, remains fully bound by these provisions. [[03:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14159.18s)]
*  First, under Article 50 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, the occupying power must ensure the proper functioning of educational institutions, particularly those serving children. [[03:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14170.18s)]
*  The systematic targeting of UNRWA schools and the displacement of students has gravely disrupted education in the OPT. [[03:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14184.18s)]
*  These acts violate the duty to protect access to education in conflict-affected areas. [[03:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14193.18s)]
*  Second, Article 59 requires the occupying power to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief, especially when local resources are insufficient. [[03:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14200.18s)]
*  The occupying power has imposed a total siege on Gaza and has systematically obstructed humanitarian aid, especially that delivered by UNRWA. [[03:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14212.18s)]
*  Access points at Rafah, Karam Abu Salim, and north of Gaza were closed. [[03:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14223.18s)]
*  Though briefly eased during the latest ceasefire agreement, restrictions were fully reinstated in March 2025, halting all supplies, including water access. [[03:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14230.18s)]
*  The obstruction of aid operation not only breaches international obligations, but may also constitute collective punishment, which is strictly prohibited under Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. [[03:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14243.18s)]
*  Furthermore, Article 63 demands that the occupying power respects the work of humanitarian organizations, something the occupying power has consistently failed to do. [[03:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14257.18s)]
*  Third, the prohibition against the use of starvation as a method of warfare is firmly entrenched as a rule of customary international law and constitutes a war crime. [[03:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14271.18s)]
*  It is unequivocally prohibited under the statutes and jurisprudence of international criminal courts and tribunals. [[03:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14284.18s)]
*  Pursuant to Articles 55 and 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, the occupying power is legally obliged to guarantee the civilian population's access to food, water, and essential provisions, [[03:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14292.18s)]
*  and to facilitate humanitarian assistance if local resources are insufficient. [[03:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14310.18s)]
*  Any deliberate interference with aid deliveries, including food, medical supplies, and clean water, is thus a violation of this obligation, severely endangering civilian lives. [[03:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14316.18s)]
*  It is deeply concerning that since March 2025, the occupying power has again resorted explicitly to starvation as a deliberate policy measure. [[03:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14331.18s)]
*  In this context, it is noteworthy that the occupying power's reenactment of recent measures constitutes another strong indication that the occupying power latently disregards the court's provisional measure order dated 28 March 2024 and the genocide case wrote by South Africa against the occupying power. [[03:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14343.18s)]
*  Fourth, the occupying power must protect humanitarian personnel and facilities. [[03:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14369.18s)]
*  Article 71-2 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts prohibits attacks, harassment, or arbitrary detention of relief workers. [[03:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14375.18s)]
*  The occupying power's targeting of UNRWA premises, aid convoys, and medical staff constitutes a serious breach of this obligation and may amount to a war crime under customary international law. [[03:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14394.18s)]
*  Fifth, under Articles 18, 20, and 56 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, hospitals, medical staff, and healthcare infrastructure are to be protected at all times. [[04:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14411.18s)]
*  Deliberate attacks on these institutions and restrictions on evacuations and medical aid have severely undermined the already fragile healthcare system in Gaza. [[04:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14425.18s)]
*  In this context, the occupying power has impeded the entry of healthcare personnel, essential medicines, and critical medical supplies into Gaza. [[04:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14438.18s)]
*  Concurrently, it has been prevented and delayed the safe evacuation of patients by international organizations and third states. [[04:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14448.18s)]
*  Mr. President, the Court has also confirmed that international human rights law continues to apply during situations of occupation, including in the OPT. [[04:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14459.18s)]
*  The occupying power remains bound by its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights to which it is a party. [[04:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14472.18s)]
*  The right to life enshrined in Article 6 of the ICCPR is absolute and non-derogable. [[04:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14487.18s)]
*  Restrictions on lifesaving aid and attacks targeting civilians constitute clear violations of this fundamental right. [[04:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14495.18s)]
*  The rights to food and water, core components of the right to an adequate standard of living as recognized in Articles 11 and 12 of the ICE-SCR, have been systematically undermined by the occupying power's destruction of critical infrastructure and obstruction of humanitarian access. [[04:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14505.18s)]
*  Similarly, the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, also guaranteed by the same Covenant, has been violated through repeated attacks on hospitals, the denial of medical evacuations, and the deliberate restriction of lifesaving medical supplies. [[04:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14527.18s)]
*  Equally, the right to education set forth in Article 13 of the same human rights instrument and reaffirmed in Article 50 of the Fourth Geneva Convention has likewise been gravely impaired by the widespread destruction of schools, forced displacement, and targeted assaults on educational institutions. [[04:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14547.18s)]
*  As far as children are concerned, pursuant to Article 6-2 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, states parties are required to take all feasible measures to ensure the survival and development of children to the greatest extent possible. [[04:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14572.18s)]
*  Accordingly, the occupying power bears a clear responsibility to ensure sufficient nutrition and protect the lives of children under its effective control. Deliberately causing malnutrition to hundreds of thousands of children is entirely unjustifiable and unequivocally prohibited under all circumstances. [[04:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14591.18s)]
*  Finally, the right to self-determination, a permanent norm of international law, underpins many of these obligations. The occupying power's sustained interference with Palestinian civil, political, and economic development, particularly through its assault on humanitarian infrastructure, represents a profound violation of this right. [[04:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14615.18s)]
*  The present advisory proceedings concern the obligations of the occupying power in relation to the presence and activities of the UN, other international organizations, and third states in relation to the OPT. [[04:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14640.18s)]
*  By clarifying these obligations and the legal consequences arising from their violation, the Court will offer indispensable guidance to the international community. [[04:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14655.18s)]
*  Kuwait expresses its full confidence that the Court's opinion will reinforce the rule of law, protect the integrity of the UN system, and reaffirm the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. [[04:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14666.18s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, this concludes Kuwait's oral statement. [[04:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14676.18s)]
*  On behalf of the delegation of Kuwait, I wish to extend our sincere appreciation to the Court for their understanding of the rights of the Palestinian people. [[04:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14681.18s)]
*  I also extend my appreciation to the Court for its careful attention and to express our gratitude to the Registry and the interpreters for their invaluable support throughout these proceedings. [[04:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14691.18s)]
*  It has been an honor to be here today. [[04:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14701.18s)]
*  I thank the representative of Kuwait for his presentation. [[04:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14704.18s)]
*  I also thank the delegation of Kuwait for their understanding of the rights of the Palestinian people. [[04:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14709.18s)]
*  I also thank the delegation of Kuwait for their understanding of the rights of the Palestinian people. [[04:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14714.18s)]
*  I also thank the delegation of Kuwait for their understanding of the rights of the Palestinian people. [[04:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14719.18s)]
*  I also thank the delegation of Kuwait for their understanding of the rights of the Palestinian people. [[04:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14726.18s)]
*  I now present the delegation of Luxembourg to speak and call Mr. Tobias Schell. [[04:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14734.18s)]
*  Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the Court, [[04:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14752.18s)]
*  It is an honor for me to present before you today, as an agent of the Government of Luxembourg, our oral observations in the context of the present request for consultative opinion. [[04:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14756.18s)]
*  By its participation, Luxembourg expresses its deep attachment to the international justice system and to the essential role that your Court plays in the affirmation and application of the rules that govern this system. [[04:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14767.18s)]
*  The participation of Luxembourg in the context of the present request reflects its willingness to contribute to the strengthening of the international order founded on the rule of law, for which your Court dreamed of an essential role. [[04:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14782.18s)]
*  The solicited consultative opinion is included in the continuity of the one made by your Court on July 19, 2024, concerning the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem. [[04:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14800.18s)]
*  In this opinion, your Court has observed the elicited presence of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territories and has affirmed the obligation for Israel to put an end to this elicited presence in the shortest possible time. [[04:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14820.18s)]
*  In particular, in regards to the prolonged occupation of the TPO, which has persisted since 1967, your Court has observed that the Israeli state, acting as an occupying power, holds a set of powers and responsibilities towards the territory on which it exerts an effective control. [[04:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14838.18s)]
*  The solicited consultative opinion would allow you to complete and deepen the legal conclusions to which your Court has come in the 2024 consultative opinion and to clarify the specific obligations of Israel in terms of the presence and activities of the United Nations in the TPO in connection with it. [[04:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14864.18s)]
*  The legal conclusions of this opinion will serve as a foundation for analyzing the obligations of Israel in the context of the present consultative procedure. [[04:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14890.18s)]
*  Since the terrible terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas on October 7, 2023, and the capture of more than 200 hostages by Hamas, the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, but also in the rest of the TPO, has dramatically worsened. [[04:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14902.18s)]
*  The rapid deterioration of the living conditions of the Palestinian population requires that your Court examine, as a priority and of utmost urgency, the additional questions raised by the General Assembly in order to clarify the obligations of Israel as a member state of the UN and occupying power in terms of the presence and activities of the UN in the TPO. [[04:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14921.18s)]
*  It is understood that the current oral observations limit themselves to answering the legal questions posed to the Court in terms of Israel's legal obligations, without prejudging the possible responsibilities of other actors. [[04:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14951.18s)]
*  In terms of the reliability of the request, Luxembourg believes that your Court is competent to respond to the request for a consultation from the General Assembly, and that it should be entitled to it, given the absence of decisive reasons to oppose a refusal. [[04:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14973.18s)]
*  In terms of the bottom line, Luxembourg wishes to present some observations on the legal points raised in the questions posed to your Court. [[04:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=14994.18s)]
*  The obligations of Israel must be examined at two distinct levels, as occupying power exercising effective control over the TPO and as a member state of the United Nations. [[04:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15004.18s)]
*  The obligations of Israel concern the presence and activities of the UN in the TPO of unlimited flows, international and charter organizations, humanitarian international law, international human rights and international customary law. [[04:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15016.18s)]
*  It is now clearly established that Israel remains the occupying power in the TPO, including the West Bank of Jordan, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. [[04:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15035.18s)]
*  The occupation is, in essence, a temporary situation. It would not be justified in transfer of sovereignty. [[04:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15048.18s)]
*  The quality of occupying power imposes to Israel a set of legal obligations that subsist, regardless of any consideration related to the length and duration of the occupation. [[04:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15057.18s)]
*  In this regard, your Court has highlighted that the obligations that occur in the international and international events that elicit from Israel do not dispense them from their continued duty to abandon the international obligations to which their behavior is subject. [[04:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15072.18s)]
*  In particular, Israel remains committed to observing the obligation that it embodies to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the obligations to which it is committed in the regard of international humanitarian law and international law related to human rights. [[04:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15090.18s)]
*  The powers and duties of Israel, in the exercise of its responsibilities as occupying power in the TPO, are governed by international humanitarian law, and in particular the regulation of the AED of 1907, which is part of international customary law, imposes itself on Israel, although it is not part of contracting the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, as well as international customary law. [[04:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15107.18s)]
*  Israel has, as occupying power, the general obligation to manage the territory occupied in the interest of the local population. This obligation comes from Article 43 of the AED. [[04:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15137.18s)]
*  This obligation also relies on the right to self-determination. [[04:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15151.18s)]
*  In the consultative report of 2024, your course stated that the dependence of the West Jordanian Sea, and more particularly the Gaza Strip, on Israel for the supply of essential goods and services, has an obstacle to the jouissance of fundamental human rights, in particular the right to self-determination. [[04:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15156.18s)]
*  However, Israel is united, by virtue of the right to self-determination, of which the Palestinian people enjoy, to take measures aimed at reducing this dependence, in particular by authorizing and facilitating the supply of essential goods and services by the United Nations. [[04:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15181.18s)]
*  By virtue of Article 55 of the fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is united to ensure the supply of the population of the TPO with the first essential necessities at the time of survival when the local resources are insufficient. [[04:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15199.18s)]
*  As you have observed in your consultative report of 2024, the occupying power has the continued obligation to ensure that the local population has adequate access to food, including water supply. [[04:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15217.18s)]
*  The primary responsibility of the supply of humanitarian aid therefore falls on the part of the power of which the civilians and other protected persons are. [[04:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15234.18s)]
*  However, if their essential needs cannot be met in this way, the party in power, its adversary, and the state-owned enterprises must allow external actors to provide humanitarian aid under certain conditions. [[04:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15245.18s)]
*  Article 59 of the fourth Geneva Convention includes two obligations. [[04:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15263.18s)]
*  On the one hand, the obligation to accept aid actions, and on the other hand, the obligation to facilitate these actions in all the measure of these means. [[04:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15269.18s)]
*  These obligations have an unconditional nature. [[04:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15280.18s)]
*  The occupying power would not be able to withstand it as long as it is established that the population of the occupied territory is insufficiently provided. [[04:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15284.18s)]
*  These collective aid actions could be undertaken by states or impartial humanitarian organizations. [[04:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15294.18s)]
*  Although the occupying power has a certain level of appreciation for the acceptance and facilitation of humanitarian aid, it remains committed to taking into account the real needs of the population of the occupied territory, as well as the available resources to provide humanitarian assistance. [[04:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15303.18s)]
*  Luxembourg has to emphasize the indispensable role played by the United Nations agencies and programs in providing essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population of the TPO, and in particular the vital role of the UNRWA. [[04:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15326.18s)]
*  Its essential role in providing humanitarian assistance to Palestinian refugees through the essential education, health, aid, social services and emergency aid programs has been recognized by the Security Council, which has described it as the backbone of all humanitarian interventions in Gaza. [[04:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15343.18s)]
*  It has also emphasized that no organization can replace or replace the capacity and mandate of UNRWA to serve Palestinian refugees and civilians who need urgent humanitarian assistance. [[04:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15366.18s)]
*  The unchangeable and vital role of UNRWA has also been highlighted by the General Assembly in its resolution of the UNRWA 1025. [[04:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15382.18s)]
*  UNRWA is the main supplier of humanitarian aid and essential services in the TPO. [[04:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15393.18s)]
*  In regard to the extreme gravity of the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and to the lack of alternatives that have the capacity required to provide adequate provision for the population, [[04:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15400.18s)]
*  it is an important task for Israel, in its capacity as an occupying power, to facilitate access without hindrance to the UNRWA agencies, including UNRWA, to humanitarian aid, in accordance with Article 59 of the Fourth Convention of Geneva. [[04:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15413.18s)]
*  Article 59, paragraph 3, imposes to all states contracting Israel's part, the obligation to authorize the free passage of the couriers and, in a complementary manner, the obligation to ensure protection. [[04:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15431.18s)]
*  Article 59, paragraph 9, paragraph 4, contains a safeguard clause allowing the occupying power to exercise its right to inspect and control the sending of its couriers and to monitor the distribution. [[04:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15449.18s)]
*  The technical provisions prescribed must however not be subject to the obligation to ensure the rapid passage and without hindrance of its couriers, as your course on the situation in Gaza affirmed. [[04:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15466.18s)]
*  Israel would not, however, exercise its right to inspect and control in an abusive or arbitrary manner to make the principle itself unapparent, or to delay the release of its couriers. [[04:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15480.18s)]
*  As the UN Secretary General has highlighted in his press release on April 8, 2025, the mechanisms of authorization recently proposed by the Israeli authorities for the release of risk aid, to limit aid without hindrance, while at the point of passage, food, medicine and shelter are accumulated and vital equipment are blocked. [[04:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15496.18s)]
*  The obligation to allow the free passage of humanitarian aid is complemented by the obligation to protect aid and humanitarian personnel, a rule that is dedicated to international and customary law. [[04:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15523.18s)]
*  In order for humanitarian aid to be provided to the civilian population, the security of humanitarian personnel who provide this aid must be ensured. [[04:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15538.18s)]
*  The personnel of this course are protected against attacks by the principle of distinction. [[04:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15548.18s)]
*  The practice not only emphasizes the prohibition of attacks against humanitarian personnel, but also that of harassment, intimidation and arbitrary detention at their encounter. [[04:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15554.18s)]
*  And announces, as an example, the condemned acts committed against humanitarian personnel. [[04:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15569.18s)]
*  Bad treatment, physical and moral violence, murder, coup, kidnapping, hostage-taking, harassment, theft, arrest and illegal detention. [[04:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15576.18s)]
*  The Security Council regularly recalls the need for parties in conflict to respect and protect humanitarian personnel. [[04:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15587.18s)]
*  In its Resolution 2730 of May 24, 2024, the Security Council has condemned without any doubt the fact of targeting the members of humanitarian personnel in the exercise of their functions, [[04:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15598.18s)]
*  to kill them, to harass them, to subject them to pursuits, to arbitrary arrests or arbitrary detentions. [[04:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15613.18s)]
*  According to the figures communicated by the United Nations Humanitarian Affairs Coordination Office on February 18, 2025, [[04:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15621.18s)]
*  at least 384 humanitarian workers have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the war in October 2003, [[04:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15629.18s)]
*  of which 277 were employees of the United Nations, most of whom were part of the UNRWA personnel. [[04:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15639.18s)]
*  As for humanitarian personnel, the goods used for humanitarian aid must also be respected and protected by international customary law, [[04:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15648.18s)]
*  yet it is entitled to the protection that international humanitarian law guarantees to civil-character goods. [[04:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15660.18s)]
*  Article 56, paragraph 1 of the 4th Convention of Geneva, [[04:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15670.18s)]
*  predicts that, in all the measure of these means, the occupying power will have the duty to ensure and maintain, [[04:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15674.18s)]
*  with the help of national and local authorities, the establishments and medical and hospital services, [[04:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15681.18s)]
*  as well as public health and hygiene in the occupied territory, [[04:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15688.18s)]
*  and that the medical personnel of all categories will be authorized to accomplish their mission. [[04:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15693.18s)]
*  It is not doubted that the hospitals and health centers of the UNRWA, and more generally health activities run by the UNRWA, [[04:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15702.18s)]
*  can be classified as establishments and medical services. [[04:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15710.18s)]
*  The occupying power has the obligation to ensure and maintain these establishments and medical services, [[04:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15714.18s)]
*  which forces them to take all necessary measures to ensure that these establishments carry out their work well. [[04:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15721.18s)]
*  As for the occupying power, it involves the obligation for Israel to abstain from taking measures that would force the health and health centers of the UNRWA [[04:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15729.18s)]
*  to end their activities or to end their infrastructure. [[04:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15740.18s)]
*  This also involves facilitating the movement of medical personnel without hindrance, [[04:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15746.18s)]
*  facilitating the delivery of medical supplies and equipment in the TPO, [[04:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15752.18s)]
*  and the possibility for the health and health personnel of the UNRWA to provide medical care to the injured and the sick. [[04:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15758.18s)]
*  Article 50, paragraph 1 of the 4th Geneva Convention, [[04:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15766.18s)]
*  provides that the occupying power will facilitate, with the competition of national and local authorities, [[04:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15770.18s)]
*  the proper functioning of the establishments dedicated to the care and education of children. [[04:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15776.18s)]
*  The activities of these institutions must therefore not be hindered by the occupying power. [[04:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15783.18s)]
*  As for the TPO, it involves the obligation for Israel to abstain from detaining the staff of the UNRWA schools, [[04:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15791.18s)]
*  to use these schools for military operations or to endow their locals. [[04:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15800.18s)]
*  The occupying power is not only to abstain from any action that would prevent the activities of these institutions, [[04:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15807.18s)]
*  but also to actively support them if the national authorities responsible are failing. [[04:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15814.18s)]
*  It must, in particular, facilitate the repair of damaged schools, facilitate the production of the necessary supplies [[04:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15821.18s)]
*  for educational activities or even secure the initiatives to allow children to access schools. [[04:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15829.18s)]
*  The obligation to facilitate the proper functioning of the institutions dedicated to the care and education of children, [[04:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15837.18s)]
*  as provided in article 50, paragraph 1, [[04:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15843.18s)]
*  must be interpreted jointly with other rules of humanitarian international law, [[04:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15846.18s)]
*  which include the well-being of children, [[04:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15851.18s)]
*  such as article 24 of the 4th Geneva Convention, [[04:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15854.18s)]
*  and the obligation, by virtue of the international customary law, [[04:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15857.18s)]
*  to give respect and protection to children affected by an armed conflict. [[04:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15860.18s)]
*  The obligations of states in the field of human rights also apply when the state exerts its sovereignty outside its territory, [[04:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15867.18s)]
*  in particular in occupying situations. [[04:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15876.18s)]
*  Your course has reminded us that the main international instruments relating to human rights, [[04:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15880.18s)]
*  the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, [[04:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15886.18s)]
*  the International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, [[04:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15889.18s)]
*  the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, [[04:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15893.18s)]
*  and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, [[04:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15899.18s)]
*  to which Israel and other parties are applicable in the TPO. [[04:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15902.18s)]
*  As your course has highlighted several times, [[04:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15908.18s)]
*  the protection offered by the conventions governing human rights does not cease in case of armed conflict or occupation. [[04:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15912.18s)]
*  The international humanitarian law and the international human rights law are complementary and must be taken into account simultaneously. [[04:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15920.18s)]
*  The instruments mentioned are enclosed in a set of dispositions applicable in the context of the supply of humanitarian aid in the TPO, [[04:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15929.18s)]
*  and concern in particular the right to life, the right of every person to be sheltered from hunger, [[04:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15938.18s)]
*  the right to a sufficient level of life for each person and their family, [[04:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15944.18s)]
*  including all food, clothing and sufficient accommodation, the right to health and the right to water. [[04:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15948.18s)]
*  It should be noted that the international pact on social and cultural economic rights [[04:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15957.18s)]
*  is the law of the UN. Israel enjoys a number of rights but also assumes duties. [[04:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15992.18s)]
*  The resolution 273 of May 11, 1949, by which the UN General Assembly admitted Israel as a member of the UN, [[04:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=15997.18s)]
*  specifies that it accepts without reservation any. [[04:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16007.18s)]
*  The obligations that come from the Charter and commit to respect them from the day it becomes a member of the UN. [[04:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16012.18s)]
*  According to my disposition of the Charter, Israel, as any member of the UN, [[04:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16021.18s)]
*  is held to an obligation of assistance in the UN that it must be fulfilled with good faith. [[04:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16026.18s)]
*  This is also true for the UN agencies that are an integral part of the UN system. [[04:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16033.18s)]
*  Given the factual circumstances that led to the seizure of the Charter, [[04:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16041.18s)]
*  namely the adoption by the Knesset on October 28, 2024, of two laws aimed at banning the activities of UNRWA, [[04:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16045.18s)]
*  the following analysis will essentially carry out on the presence and activities of these agencies in the TPO. [[04:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16054.18s)]
*  The privileges and immunity necessary to the action of the UN and its agencies on the territory of each of these Member States [[04:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16060.18s)]
*  are protected in accordance with Article 105 of the Charter. [[04:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16069.18s)]
*  The privileges and immunity that the UNRWA enjoys are defined in more detail in the general convention [[04:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16074.18s)]
*  on the privileges and immunity of the United Nations in 1946, to which Israel was assigned in 1949. [[04:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16080.18s)]
*  As a member of the UNRWA, Israel is held to respect the obligations in the matter of the privileges and immunity that come with it. [[04:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16088.18s)]
*  According to Section 35 of the General Convention, Member States cannot denounce this Convention as long as they are members of the UNRWA. [[04:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16099.18s)]
*  As for UNRWA specifically, the General Assembly reiterated repeatedly the application of the General Convention to this agency [[04:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16110.18s)]
*  and reminded that Israel is held to respect the UNRWA mandate as well as its privileges and immunity. [[04:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16122.18s)]
*  As a subsidiary body of the UNRWA, UNRWA benefits from the same immunities and privileges in all its Member States, including Israel. [[04:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16130.18s)]
*  In the exchange of letters, as Michel More concluded in 1967, [[04:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16141.18s)]
*  Israel acknowledged that the General Convention was in charge of the relations between the Israeli government and UNRWA regarding the exercise of functions of the agency. [[04:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16146.18s)]
*  The laws of October 28-24 foretell the abrogation of the so-called agreement and the revocation of the privileges and immunity granted to UNRWA. [[04:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16155.18s)]
*  However, it should be noted that this exchange of letters could not constitute the legal basis of the presence of UNRWA or the UN on the Israeli territory. [[04:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16164.18s)]
*  This is the pre-existing conclusion of the provisional agreement. [[04:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16174.18s)]
*  The agreement does not create the immunity privileges of UNRWA, but only recognizes their existence. [[04:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16178.18s)]
*  As a result, the resiliation of the agreement would not deprive the Agency of immunity privileges which it enjoys through the General Convention. [[04:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16185.18s)]
*  According to Section 34 of the General Convention, Israel must be able to apply the provisions of the Convention by virtue of its own rights. [[04:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16194.18s)]
*  It cannot invoke the provisions of its internal law as justifying the non-execution of obligations. [[04:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16205.18s)]
*  It is clear that the internal laws of Israel, including the laws of the Knesset, must be implemented in a way that is compatible with the international obligations of Israel by virtue of the Convention. [[04:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16212.18s)]
*  Luxembourg considers that certain provisions of the laws adopted by the Knesset are likely, if they are implemented, to violate the obligations of Israel under Article 105 of the Charter and the General Convention. [[04:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16226.18s)]
*  By virtue of these laws, any contact between the employees of Israel and UNRWA or through an intermediary is prohibited. [[04:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16242.18s)]
*  This makes it impossible for the Agency to exercise its functions without contacting the Israeli authorities, especially regarding the delivery of visas to its staff. [[04:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16251.18s)]
*  This measure goes against the obligation of assistance that Israel owes to the UN and its organizations by virtue of the Charter. [[04:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16268.18s)]
*  The laws of the Knesset also suggest that criminal pursuits against UNRWA staff cannot be excluded. [[04:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16277.18s)]
*  If the scope of this arrangement does not seem to be clear, it is important to note that any criminal pursuit committed by Israel against UNRWA staff would be incompatible with the Convention that grants an immunity of jurisdiction to UN officials for the acts carried out by them in the exercise of their functions. [[04:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16286.18s)]
*  According to Section 20 of the Convention, the immunity of UN officials could be raised to the decision of the UN. [[04:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16310.18s)]
*  If Israel wishes to raise this immunity in particular cases, it should demand it from the UN and motivate it. [[04:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16319.18s)]
*  In invoking the laws of the Knesset, Israel demanded that UNRWA stop its activities in Jerusalem and leave all its staff until the 30th of January 2025, although this is incompatible with the inviolability of UNRWA staff. [[04:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16331.18s)]
*  It is good to have these assets under the section 3 of the Convention. [[04:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16351.18s)]
*  The inviolability of UNRWA staff is absolute. [[04:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16356.18s)]
*  It cannot be excluded for the reasons that, in particular circumstances of hostilities, the inviolability of UNRWA staff and goods should be restricted or replaced by military opportunities. [[04:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16360.18s)]
*  The Charter and the Convention do not admit any reserve in this regard. [[04:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16378.18s)]
*  It is the result of what precedes that Israel's demands regarding UNRWA's stop its activities, the evacuation of its staff and the loss of immunity and inviolability in Jewish staff and staff, if they are implemented, go against Israel's legal obligations to the Charter and the Convention. [[04:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16382.18s)]
*  The UN and its staff, including UNRWA, must continue to benefit from the privileges and immunities necessary to accomplish their mission. [[04:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16407.18s)]
*  Luxembourg considers, therefore, that the laws of the Knesset are incompatible with the obligations of Israel, in virtue of international law. [[04:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16418.18s)]
*  Their implementation would, as a consequence, prevent UNRWA from continuing its essential activities in the Charter, thus putting the unique and irreplaceable mandate conferred on the agency in danger. [[04:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16427.18s)]
*  Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the Court, allow me to make a few final remarks. [[04:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16444.18s)]
*  The legal obligations that [[04:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16451.18s)]
*  are in the hands of Israel, both as occupying power in the Charter and as a member of the United Nations, [[04:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16453.98s)]
*  require cooperation with the United Nations agencies, including UNRWA, to ensure the continuity of humanitarian operations in the Charter. [[04:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16460.18s)]
*  The respect of these obligations is even more imperative in the face of the dramatic humanitarian urgency that is taking place in the Gaza Strip. [[04:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16470.18s)]
*  The survival of hundreds of thousands of civilians depends on access to humanitarian aid. [[04:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16479.18s)]
*  The access of the United Nations in the Charter, particularly through UNRWA, is essential and indispensable, [[04:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16485.18s)]
*  both in terms of the progression of humanitarian aid and the basic service provision, such as health and education. [[04:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16492.18s)]
*  At this end, the role of UNRWA, recognized by the international community as irreplaceable, must be fully protected. [[04:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16502.18s)]
*  As occupying power, Israel is held by international humanitarian law to administer the TPO in the interest of the local population, [[04:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16510.18s)]
*  particularly by providing humanitarian aid to the civilian population and by facilitating the actions of these courses organized by the TPO in the United Nations agencies. [[04:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16520.18s)]
*  This also involves allowing the free passage of humanitarian aid and ensuring their protection. [[04:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16532.18s)]
*  As a member of the UNRWA, Israel must facilitate and protect the presence of UNRWA activities and these organs, [[04:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16539.18s)]
*  particularly by respecting the applicable immunities. [[04:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16546.18s)]
*  Mr. President, Madam Members of the Court, this concludes my intervention and I thank you for your attention. [[04:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16551.18s)]
*  I thank the representative of the UNRWA for her presentation, which will be held in the audience this afternoon. [[04:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16562.18s)]
*  The oral proceedings will resume tomorrow at 10 a.m. in order for the Maldives, Mexico, Namibia, and Norway to be heard on the questions submitted to the Court. [[04:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16571.18s)]
*  The sitting is closed. [[04:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16587.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16601.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbR9CQVAMV4&t=16631.18s)]
