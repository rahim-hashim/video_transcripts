# BREAKING: Netanyahu says Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar has been 'eliminated'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8)
*  But the reports that coming from the Israeli Prime Minister, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=0.0s)]
*  Benyam Esen Yahu, that Mohammed Sinwar has been killed. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=4.16s)]
*  Now, the IDF carried out massive series of airstrikes [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=7.96s)]
*  on the European hospital in Gaza a couple of weeks ago. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=12.88s)]
*  They believed that they had intelligence [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=16.6s)]
*  that Mohammed Sinwar was in the tunnels [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=18.72s)]
*  underneath that hospital. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=21.48s)]
*  And they think that that was a moment that he wasn't [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=23.76s)]
*  close to any of the hostages. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=26.28s)]
*  And so they took that opportunity [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=28.52s)]
*  to carry out a huge series of airstrikes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=30.84s)]
*  But there had been no confirmation [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=33.8s)]
*  whether or not they had got Mohammed Sinwar. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=35.64s)]
*  Obviously, getting kind of any confirmation [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=38.6s)]
*  is pretty difficult, because they cannot get IDF soldiers [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=40.36s)]
*  to the scene. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=44.72s)]
*  And so they, I'm speculating here, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=45.8s)]
*  would have had to have relied on things possibly [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=48.44s)]
*  like communications intercepts to try and determine [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=51.04s)]
*  whether or not Hamas communications were indicating [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=54.6s)]
*  that Sinwar was dead. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=60.08s)]
*  Now, if what Benyam Esen Yahu has said is accurate, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=61.4s)]
*  the only reason I caveat that is because there's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=66.4s)]
*  been no official release from the Prime Minister's office, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=68.8s)]
*  no official statement from the Israeli military. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  But if Mohammed Sinwar has been killed by the IDF, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=75.2s)]
*  then that is very significant. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=78.68s)]
*  Mohammed Sinwar was the brother of Yahya Sinwar. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=80.2s)]
*  Yahya Sinwar killed towards the end of last year. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  He was the leader of Hamas. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=87.88s)]
*  He was the mastermind behind October the 7th. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  And he was succeeded as the leader of Hamas in Gaza, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=93.68s)]
*  at least, by his brother. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=97.88s)]
*  His brother's, he was never quite the figure [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=100.08s)]
*  that Yahya was. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=103.12s)]
*  But he became the senior figure for Hamas in Gaza [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  over the last six or seven months. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=108.6s)]
*  He would have been the point man, the main decision [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  maker for Hamas within Gaza when it came to any ceasefire [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=116.2s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  It was said that he was pretty stubborn. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=120.64s)]
*  There were reports that often it was Mohammed Sinwar who [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=124.44s)]
*  would put in late demands or try to change the terms of any [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=127.4s)]
*  ceasefire agreement. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=132.68s)]
*  And so the hope has been here, at least, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=133.76s)]
*  that if Mohammed Sinwar was eliminated, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=137.04s)]
*  then not only would it further degrade [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=139.76s)]
*  Hamas's command structure, which already is in absolute tatters, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=142.68s)]
*  but it also might remove an individual who [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=146.6s)]
*  had blocked some of the negotiations [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=150.76s)]
*  to try and reach a truce. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=153.84s)]
*  So we'll see whether or not that materializes. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=155.28s)]
*  There are lots of rumors around at the moment [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=158.32s)]
*  about a potential ceasefire being close. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=160.84s)]
*  I have to say, every time it seems as though there might [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  be movement in that direction, that it hasn't actually [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=166.4s)]
*  gone anywhere. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  It tends to be the Israelis, but also actually, in fairness, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=171.72s)]
*  backed by the Americans saying that Hamas are not [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=174.0s)]
*  agreeing to the deal that is on the table. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=176.88s)]
*  But the elimination of Mohammed Sinwar [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=179.88s)]
*  would be another success for the Israeli military [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=182.96s)]
*  as they're looking to not just decapitate the Hamas leadership, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=185.84s)]
*  but completely dismantle Hamas's ability to operate and function [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  as a military force within Gaza, and also as a political force [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=194.6s)]
*  within Gaza. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=199.4s)]
*  All right, Ali, for now in Jerusalem, thank you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsnu07lK4K8&t=200.88s)]
