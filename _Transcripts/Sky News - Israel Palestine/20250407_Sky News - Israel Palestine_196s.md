Video Description: The president of the Palestine Red Crescent Society has called for an independent investigation into Israel's "intentional killing" of aid workers in Gaza.

Fifteen Palestinian medics were killed when their convoy of ambulances was attacked by Israeli soldiers.

Israeli initially said the vehicles were not using emergency lights - video emerged at the weekend proving that claim to be wrong.

Israel then said the soldiers were acting out of a "perceived threat".

# Palestine Red Crescent calls for UN investigation into Israeli killing of Palestinian medics
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw)
*  A warning, Alistair Bunkle's report contains video of the moment the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=0.0s)]
*  convoy was attacked. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=4.08s)]
*  This video that emerged over the weekend of a convoy of ambulances [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=7.28s)]
*  with their emergency lights on has raised serious questions about why [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=10.68s)]
*  the Israeli military opened fire on it, killing 15 medics and aid workers. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=14.96s)]
*  GUNSHOTS [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=19.76s)]
*  It is proven that Israel's initial explanation was false, but there are [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=23.48s)]
*  many more questions still unanswered. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=28.8s)]
*  Today, the Palestinian Red Crescent released the full 17-minute video of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=59.76s)]
*  the convoy before it was ambushed by the IDF. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=64.28s)]
*  Sky News has analysed the video and plotted the route they took. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=68.6s)]
*  It shows them driving north out of Rafa towards the point the ambulance was [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=73.24s)]
*  last seen. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=77.16s)]
*  At one point, one of the vehicles is lost and stops to ask another for help. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  They then drive back south until they see the ambulance. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=88.8s)]
*  This route, and the exchanges in the video, seem to be further cooperation [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=108.36s)]
*  The convoy was on a journey to find missing colleagues, not a Hamas unit [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  looking for Israeli soldiers to attack. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=119.64s)]
*  Today, the Israeli government spoke publicly for the first time about the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  incident. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  A spokesman was asked twice by Sky News if there was any proof that some of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=129.72s)]
*  the medics were affiliated with Hamas, as claimed. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=134.6s)]
*  The Israeli spokesman refused to answer directly. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=138.48s)]
*  The reason why this is an issue is because again and again, Hamas and other [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  terrorist organisations have misused the emergency services. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=147.72s)]
*  They've used them as their own arm. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  They've ferried their own terrorists inside, away from, to try and escape [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  from Israel. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  It is not Hamas who have claimed that the 15 dead were medics. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=162.28s)]
*  It is the United Nations. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=167.8s)]
*  Allahu Akbar! [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=169.68s)]
*  The Red Crescent Emergency Service. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=171.28s)]
*  Tonight, a preliminary finding by the IDF said that the soldiers opened fire [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  because of a perceived threat following an earlier encounter with Hamas [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  fighters. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  The full IDF investigation is expected to report in the coming days. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oyaazrEYw&t=186.28s)]
