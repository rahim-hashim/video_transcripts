Video Description: A man accused of attacking people with a flamethrower and petrol bombs at a pro-Israel rally in Colorado has been charged with 16 counts of attempted murder.
Mohamed Soliman, 45, was arrested after allegedly using a makeshift flamethrower and petrol bombs to target a group of people in Boulder, Colorado.

**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q)
*  This is Mohammed Sabri Soliman, the 45-year-old Egyptian native, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=0.0s)]
*  facing state and federal charges over what the FBI called a targeted act of terrorism. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=4.84s)]
*  Twelve people, one of them a Holocaust survivor, were injured, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=11.92s)]
*  one seriously, in the attack in Boulder, Colorado. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=15.6s)]
*  There were 16 counts of attempted murder in the first degree. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=19.12s)]
*  Eight of those counts are for attempted murder with intent and after deliberation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=23.0s)]
*  The other eight counts are attempted murder with extreme indifference. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=28.96s)]
*  So 16 counts total. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=33.72s)]
*  If the defendant is convicted and those counts are running consecutive to one another, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=35.56s)]
*  he would face a maximum of 384 years in state prison. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  We're here, brother. We're here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=44.44s)]
*  We can't do that to Mohammed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=47.92s)]
*  Still holding two bottles, still venting his anger. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=50.56s)]
*  For the sake of the police, and for us. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=53.96s)]
*  As victims lay injured on the ground nearby. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=57.48s)]
*  They had been taking part in a weekly march in support of Israeli hostages in Gaza, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=64.52s)]
*  when they came under attack from a man wielding petrol bombs and a makeshift flamethrower. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=69.72s)]
*  They had like really bad burns all up on their legs, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=74.8s)]
*  and then I went over to this other grass area that was like right by the front entrance, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=78.2s)]
*  and there was another lady on the ground with really bad burns on her legs, just like screaming. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  Police say they found another 16 unlit Molotov cocktails nearby, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=89.16s)]
*  and that the suspect had been planning the attack for a year. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=94.08s)]
*  On top of the state charges, he's facing a federal hate crime charge. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  The Trump administration blamed President Biden's open door policy on immigration. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=101.92s)]
*  We know that this individual, this terrorist, was allowed into this country [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=107.16s)]
*  by the previous administration, was foolishly given a tourism visa, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  and then was illegally allowed to stay. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  These individuals are going to be deported, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=117.36s)]
*  and we're not going to tolerate such violence in our country. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=119.2s)]
*  Ten days ago, a shooting outside the Jewish Museum in Washington [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  claimed the lives of two young diplomats. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=126.28s)]
*  And in April, an arsonist targeted the residence of Pennsylvania's Jewish governor, Josh Shapiro. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  This latest violence will only add to the fears of America's Jewish community. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=136.0s)]
*  David Blevins, Sky News in Washington. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrDbPgqp_Q&t=141.48000000000002s)]
