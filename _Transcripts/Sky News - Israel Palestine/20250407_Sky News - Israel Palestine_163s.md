Video Description: Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer says that Hamas have been "cruelly exploiting" the civilian population of Gaza, using them as a "human shield for its actions", as footage shows the IDF opening fire on Gaza medical workers.

When questioned by Sky's Middle East correspondent Alistair Bunkall over the "revised" number of Hamas soldiers Israel say posed as medics, Mr Mencer says that on "many documented occasions" Hamas have "used ambulances as cover to transport terrorists". 

He goes on to say they are "abusing the very notion of emergency services".

# Hamas 'used ambulances as cover to transport terrorists', says Israeli govt spokesperson
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g)
*  Alistair Bunkle from Sky News, let me read your question here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=0.0s)]
*  The IDF initially claimed that 8 of the 15 medics were killed were Hamas, this is now [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=7.4s)]
*  being revised down to 6. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=12.24s)]
*  Given that the initial reports about the ambulances not using their emergency lights have now [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  been exposed as false and the lack of any evidence provided so far to prove some of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=19.68s)]
*  the medics were Hamas, why should we conclude that they're anything but innocent, medical [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=24.92s)]
*  and aid workers? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=29.66s)]
*  And you've also asked what steps have been taken by the IDF whilst the internal investigation [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=31.26s)]
*  proceeds, have soldiers been involved, involved being withdrawn from duties in Gaza? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=35.34s)]
*  Thank you for that question, Alistair. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=41.82s)]
*  Alistair, there's an issue which I almost never see reported in international media [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=44.7s)]
*  and that is the fact that it is a matter of public record that Hamas have on many occasions, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  on many documented occasions, used ambulances as a cover. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=59.62s)]
*  What sort of cover? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=65.89999999999999s)]
*  To transport terrorists, to escape from Israel's forces, abusing the very notion of emergency [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=67.44s)]
*  services. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=76.1s)]
*  Just like the boy that cried wolf in Aesop's Fables, Hamas have been abusing emergency [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=77.86s)]
*  services and that is the real essence of this issue. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=85.88s)]
*  But on the reports about the attack on aid workers in Ruffa, whilst on a stakeout against [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=91.64s)]
*  terrorist activity, against terrorist activity, IDF soldiers opened fire from a distance at [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=97.94s)]
*  vehicles that were moving suspiciously in their direction, among the dead were six Hamas [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=103.78s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=109.64s)]
*  What were Hamas terrorists doing in ambulances? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=111.41999999999999s)]
*  The incident was reported in real time to UN officials, the IDF is conducting an investigation, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=115.62s)]
*  as you know, into the circumstances of the incident that took place two weeks ago. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=121.56s)]
*  The Hamas terror organisation systematically violates international law by taking over [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  civilian facilities and infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and mosques, while cruelly [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=134.26s)]
*  exploiting and placing the civilian population in Gaza at risk by using it as a human shield [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=140.26s)]
*  for its actions. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  So with this ongoing investigation, I'll leave that answer at that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=151.73999999999998s)]
*  The results of the investigation should be released shortly. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m7rp1rRp-g&t=155.72s)]
