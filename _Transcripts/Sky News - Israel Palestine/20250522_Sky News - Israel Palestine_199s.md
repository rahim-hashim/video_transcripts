Video Description: The UN says around 90 aid trucks carrying food and humanitarian supplies have arrived in Gaza.

A total of 200 lorries are expected to enter the Strip.

Israel gave permission for dozens of aid trucks to enter Gaza earlier this week, in the face of international pressure, after blocking all food, medicine, fuel for almost three months.

*  on Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=15.32s)]
*  Most stocks of food and baby formula have almost run out. Many are already depleted. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  The situation is catastrophic for pregnant women and children. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Some aid is now starting to get into Gaza and to the millions who need it. Only a little [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=29.8s)]
*  and not yet enough, but it is something. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=35.88s)]
*  United Nations said that 90 truckloads of aid has now been processed, including flour, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=39.6s)]
*  sugar and food. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=44.8s)]
*  Mina is nine years old. The last time she had any bread, she says, was almost two months [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  ago. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=51.84s)]
*  The border is closed and flour is unbelievably expensive. Two thousand to three thousand [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=54.48s)]
*  shekels. We don't have that kind of money. No one can work anymore, so we can't eat. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=60.76s)]
*  As soon as food is available, there is a panicked scramble to get to the front and get some [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  before it runs out. Fail and the whole family might go without anything at all. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=82.28s)]
*  The meal today was a bowl of plain rice. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=94.04s)]
*  Unbelievable prices. I'm one of the many here who can't afford anything, not a tomato, not [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=101.68s)]
*  a cucumber, chili pepper. I just can't buy it. The prices in the market are just unbelievable. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=105.36s)]
*  I've been at this soup kitchen since 8 a.m. waiting for a plate of rice or some cooked [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=113.28s)]
*  beans. My children sometimes go to bed without dinner. Sometimes they don't have breakfast. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=117.12s)]
*  They wait for me to come back with something from the soup kitchen for lunch. If I couldn't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=123.2s)]
*  get anything, then they won't have lunch. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=127.28s)]
*  These bags of flour have just arrived in Gaza. They'll be used to make thousands of loaves [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=131.36s)]
*  of pita bread. This is the first time this bakery has been working in months. The bread [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=136.08s)]
*  will immediately go to those most in need. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=141.52s)]
*  What we brought is definitely not enough, but we hope that the borders will remain open [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=145.0s)]
*  and we'll be able to bring more aid into Gaza. Two point two million people of Gaza, almost [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=149.84s)]
*  Everyone depends on humanitarian aid. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=157.72s)]
*  Ceasefire talks in Qatar have completely broken down. Benjamin Netanyahu is now demanding [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  the relocation of Gazans to another country as one of his conditions to end the war. The [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  aid blockade might be over. Gaza is now getting some food to eat. But peace, that remains [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIGYeEMfwX8&t=174.8s)]
