Hamas has released an Israeli-American hostage from Gaza, as part of efforts to secure a permanent ceasefire with Israel. 

Edan Alexander, 21, was serving in an infantry unit when he was taken by Hamas during the 7 October attacks. 

It's the first hostage release since Israel ended a ceasefire in March, and the deal was negotiated by President Trump's team. 

Sky's Middle East Correspondent Alistair Bunkall reports from Jerusalem.

*  On board a flight to Israel alongside Eden Alexander's mother, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=45.44s)]

*  CHEERING [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=64.96s)]
*  Eden Alexander's family, who had gathered in Israel for his release, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=66.96s)]

*  bring Eden back to us. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=78.0s)]
*  And now there are 50, other 50, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=80.36s)]
*  58 hostages that we need to bring them back all together. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=86.52s)]
*  Immediately. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=92.16s)]
*  There is hope in Israel that this deal would lead to the release [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=93.52s)]
*  of the remaining 58 hostages, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=96.72s)]
*  but also anger that President Trump has done [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=99.0s)]
*  what Benjamin Netanyahu hasn't. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  I promise you, Netanyahu, if you don't end the war now [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=107.44s)]
*  and my child is murdered because of you while he's in captivity, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=111.16s)]
*  I will haunt you until your last day and I will not be alone. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=115.56s)]
*  And as Benjamin Netanyahu entered court in Tel Aviv [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  for another day of his trial, he was confronted. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  Nimrod Cohen is the same age as Eden Alexander [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=132.36s)]
*  and was taken by Hamas from the same military base on October 7. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  He remains in Gaza. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=140.52s)]
*  His father says Netanyahu is to blame for his son's fate. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=142.6s)]
*  It was never a priority for Netanyahu to release hostages. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  His only priority is to keep his position as prime minister, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=149.68s)]
*  to keep himself free from prison. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=154.76s)]
*  But Netanyahu welcomed Eden Alexander's release and said [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=161.48s)]
*  Israeli action had pressured Hamas to do the deal. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=165.2s)]
*  Seventeen people were killed, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=169.88s)]
*  in a strike on a school in northern Gaza earlier today. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=173.76s)]
*  Women and children were again amongst the dead. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  The Americans are pushing a plan to restart humanitarian aid deliveries into Gaza. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=180.84s)]
*  But there is hope that the release of Eden Alexander [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=186.48s)]
*  could persuade Trump to push Israel and Hamas to accept a new ceasefire deal too. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAexr7XH5nc&t=189.16s)]
