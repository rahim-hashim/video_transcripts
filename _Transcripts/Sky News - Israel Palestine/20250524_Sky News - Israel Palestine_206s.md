# Nine of Gazan doctor's 10 children killed in Israeli strike
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo)
*  In Gaza, emergency workers rushing to the site of another airstrike. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli bombs do not discriminate between young and old. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=6.24s)]
*  When they get there, they start recovering the badly burned remains of children. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=10.64s)]
*  Is there anybody alive? They shout into the dark. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=17.44s)]
*  It is a horrific scene. One body after another emerges from the rubble. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=23.12s)]
*  In all, there are nine, brothers and sisters from the same family. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=29.2s)]
*  The eldest child was just 12. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=33.68s)]
*  The images have been blurred because they are too graphic to show. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=36.72s)]
*  We started to get them out one by one. We got out the third child. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=44.8s)]
*  Of course, we couldn't identify the children. They were charred. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=49.36s)]
*  They had no clothes, no face. They were remains. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=52.96s)]
*  Nearby, their father, Dr Hamdi Al-Najat, is found alive but gravely wounded. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=56.16s)]
*  He doesn't know yet that most of his family is gone. Nine of his 10 children killed. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  He just returned home after dropping his wife, Dr Ala Al-Najat, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=76.08s)]
*  a pediatrician at work for her shift. Then the missile struck. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=80.16s)]
*  Israel's military says it was targeting suspects in Khan Yunis [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=86.16s)]
*  and is reviewing the claim of harm to civilians. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=92.56s)]
*  The paramedics take Dr Al-Najat to the Nasser Medical Complex. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=98.24s)]
*  Where he once saved lives, he returns as a casualty. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=102.96s)]
*  British doctors working alongside Palestinian medics operated on their only surviving child. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=107.36s)]
*  He's called Adam. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=114.32s)]
*  The last patient on my list today was an 11-year-old boy who seemed much younger [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  as he lifted him onto the operating table. His injuries were bad enough, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  but the background, I think, was worse. His father was a physician here at the Nasser Hospital. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  We've asked about him. He had no political and no military connections. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=134.32s)]
*  He doesn't seem to be prominent on social media, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=139.2s)]
*  and yet his poor wife is the only uninjured one. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=142.8s)]
*  At the hospital, the bodies of the dead children are gently taken from the ambulance one by one. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=146.4s)]
*  They're then laid on the floor of the morgue. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=164.08s)]
*  This is a place of unimaginable grief. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=168.72s)]
*  This video, shared by the family, shows Yves, Ruslan and Jubran playing before the war started. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=173.68s)]
*  Now, along with their siblings, they are another statistic in a conflict [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=181.76s)]
*  that has claimed the lives of thousands of children. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=186.24s)]
*  But despite the rising death toll, the Israeli military campaign is intensifying. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=191.68s)]
*  For those trapped here, the horror of this war is endless. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=197.27999999999997s)]
*  Alex Rossi, Sky News, Jerusalem. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8CPvnmk8Bo&t=202.55999999999997s)]
