Video Description: As people take a break for the Easter holiday, in the Gaza Strip there is no respite from the 18-month-long war with Israel. 

For Ramez al-Souri, the pain is unimaginable after his three children were killed by an Israeli airstrike, on an annex of Gaza's Saint Porphyrius Greek Orthodox Church.

"My home has changed completely because there are no smiles, no laughter, no joy. I lost my flower - my daughter Julie - and my boys Suhail and Majd. They were salt of the Earth," Mr Al-Souri said.

# Gaza father grieves for family killed in Israeli airstrike on church building
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM)
*  This Easter there is no celebration for Rames Al-Soury. He's from Gaza's small community [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=0.0s)]
*  of Christians. And his loss is unimaginable. Three children killed by an Israeli airstrike [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=7.5s)]
*  on a building attached to a church in the first month of the war. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=15.66s)]
*  My home has changed completely because there are no smiles, no laughter, no joy. But the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=20.26s)]
*  soul I longed to have with me is gone. I lost my flower, my daughter Julie. Suhail [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=29.86s)]
*  and Marjad, my boys, were sorts of the earth. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  It is a loss that never leaves him and one shared by almost every family in Gaza. This [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=43.1s)]
*  war has taken a brutal toll and still does every day. And nowhere is the humanitarian [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=49.54s)]
*  crisis as stark as it is here. Israel has blocked aid trucks from entering since the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=60.06s)]
*  ceasefire collapsed one month ago. It says it's to pressure Hamas. But the pressure [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=66.74s)]
*  is here on the Al-Asher family. Seven people living in a tent in Hanunis. Ahmed says he [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=73.78s)]
*  used to hate lentils and now it's all he eats. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=81.62s)]
*  Before the war we used to have fruits, chicken, vegetables. Everything was available. We were [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=85.78s)]
*  never hungry. Now we're craving food, chicken, anything. The only thing we can eat now is [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=95.66s)]
*  what the soup kitchen provides. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=101.78s)]
*  Back in north Gaza there is some solace in ritual. For Remes this time of reflection [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=108.78s)]
*  is painful. Seaside talks are going nowhere. Israel has tightened its blockade and the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=117.74000000000001s)]
*  situation grows worse by the day. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=128.1s)]
*  This Easter is no different than the last. We're tending to our wounds. We continue [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=136.74s)]
*  to hope for an end to this war and to suffering. For the darkness over Gaza to finally lift. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  But there is barely a flicker of light in an Easter weighed down by war and by grief. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=150.26s)]
*  Nicole Johnston, Sky News, Jerusalem. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJgYVbTgGM&t=158.26s)]
