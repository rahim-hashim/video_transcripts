# Israeli strike on Gaza shelter leaves at least 20 dead and dozens injured
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U)
*  What is the latest on this, I guess, latest round of attacks? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, this happened in the early hours of the morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=8.16s)]
*  A school in northern Gaza, around Gaza City, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=10.68s)]
*  a neighbourhood of Gaza City, apparently hit by three missiles. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=14.56s)]
*  And it was sheltering, as a lot of the schools now are in Gaza, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=19.64s)]
*  displaced families. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=23.8s)]
*  When the fire services got there, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=25.76s)]
*  at least three of the classrooms were in furnace, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=28.84s)]
*  golfed in flames. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=31.76s)]
*  I've seen pictures and video of charred bodies coming out. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=32.76s)]
*  It is an inscribable situation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=37.8s)]
*  20 dead, at least according to the health ministry in Gaza. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  We've been told 30 dead by some people who were on the scene [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=45.32s)]
*  and could rise further. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=48.84s)]
*  No comment from the Israeli military as yet. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=51.0s)]
*  So we will continue to see whether or not [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=54.96s)]
*  they will give a comment on this later. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=57.24s)]
*  But it looks like another case where civilians, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=58.92s)]
*  and women and children in particular, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  have been killed in part of this war. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=65.0s)]
*  And then similarly, Ali, wanted to ask you about the news [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=68.68s)]
*  that the head of the US-backed Gaza aid group has resigned. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=71.44s)]
*  Do we know why that is and what the potential implications are? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=75.72s)]
*  So this is something called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  If you've not heard of it, I think you will do in the coming days. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=85.36s)]
*  It's a private company that has been set up [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=89.08s)]
*  ostensibly to deliver aid into Gaza [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  and to bypass the established humanitarian organisations [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=97.55999999999999s)]
*  that already work there, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=102.08s)]
*  whether that's the United Nations or other charities. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=103.35999999999999s)]
*  It's very controversial. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  Actually, just this weekend, there were big articles [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=108.52s)]
*  in the Washington Post, in the New York Times, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=111.08s)]
*  the Haaretz newspaper here in Israel, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  trying to investigate who is behind it, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=115.64s)]
*  where's the money coming from? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=118.84s)]
*  And most of them are actually linking it back to Israel, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=120.56s)]
*  saying that this was a concept [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=122.8s)]
*  that was dreamt up by a group of Israelis, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=125.8s)]
*  perhaps connected to the government as well. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=128.56s)]
*  And what the plan to do is to have four hubs to deliver aid, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=131.16s)]
*  three in the very south and one in the centre. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=137.68s)]
*  Aid organisations have refused to be a part of it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=141.0s)]
*  They say they don't want to be a part of it at all. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=144.08s)]
*  They question where the money is coming from. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=145.8s)]
*  They question the motive. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=148.56s)]
*  They say that if you put aid hubs in the south, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=150.08s)]
*  what it's doing is it's effectively luring people [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=153.08s)]
*  towards the food away from the north. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=155.28s)]
*  And, well, aid agencies say it is effectively [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  a method of ethnic cleansing, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=161.88s)]
*  so they don't want to be a part of it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  And overnight, the CEO, Jake Wood, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  has resigned on the eve of this coming to operation, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  saying it is clear that it is not possible to implement this plan [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=172.92s)]
*  while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=177.44s)]
*  of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=180.55999999999997s)]
*  which I will not abandon. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=185.0s)]
*  So really dramatic twist in this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  The Israelis said this is how aid is going to get [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=189.11999999999998s)]
*  to the millions of Gazans. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  We've just heard that the foundation plans [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=193.64s)]
*  to start work today, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  but it is looking as though it is a messy start, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=197.64s)]
*  and critics, of which there are many, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  will say the resignation of the CEO [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=204.92s)]
*  is exactly what we've been saying all along. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  This is not an independent body. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=209.6s)]
*  This is a body set up to do the Israelis' work for them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECN2wbvoK_U&t=210.92s)]
