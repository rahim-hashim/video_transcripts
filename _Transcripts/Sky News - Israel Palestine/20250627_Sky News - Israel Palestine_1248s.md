# Is Europe ready for a drone war?
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4)
*  Welcome back. Yesterday we saw NATO leaders commit to more defence spending to counter the threat from Russia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=0.0s)]
*  They were brow beaten into action by Donald Trump who made clear America would no longer act as Europe's protector. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  They've pledged to spend more by 2035 but that is 10 years away and every day the battlefield is changing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=12.8s)]
*  In the skies, on land and on the waves drones are revolutionising the way we fight. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=20.2s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia are the most battle-ready. They each make millions each year. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=26.4s)]
*  Europe's armies though are lagging behind by comparison. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  Ukraine has on record produced 1.3 million drones last year. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=34.8s)]
*  I would be surprised if NATO even bought like a thousand drones last year. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=39.8s)]
*  Drones are responsible for hundreds, maybe thousands of deaths in Russia's war in Ukraine. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=44.8s)]
*  They've allowed both battle-weary countries to build armies in the sky. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  It doesn't get hungry, it doesn't get sick and it doesn't get tired. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=54.4s)]
*  This is a Shahed drone manufactured in Russia and Iran. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=60.6s)]
*  They fly low then swoop up high before diving for their target making them almost impossible to intercept. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=64.8s)]
*  Sources tell me that Ukrainian authorities are expecting up to 500 of them each night in the coming weeks and months. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=71.6s)]
*  Tonight I'll hear from a commander in the Ukrainian army as we ask is Europe ready for the drone revolution? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=79.0s)]
*  Siobhans Robbins has this special report. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=85.0s)]
*  Off the Polish coast we're sailing in contested waters. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=92.0s)]
*  On board, crews from the Royal and US navies. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=98.0s)]
*  Copy, standing by. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=102.0s)]
*  Stand by! [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=104.0s)]
*  But it's not just humans on this training mission. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=105.2s)]
*  We're joined by this fleet of drones, crucial companions in increasingly uncertain times. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=109.2s)]
*  The drones that we have in the water right now are called GARKS. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=117.2s)]
*  They are optimised for going out providing maritime domain awareness, collecting an open ocean as well as providing one-way attack. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=120.2s)]
*  Sabotage has rocketed in the Baltic Sea since the start of the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=128.2s)]
*  Russia's been accused of damaging cables and pipelines, something it denies. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=134.39999999999998s)]
*  In the future, unmanned vessels could be used to monitor this area 24-7 for signs of enemy activity. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  All at the fraction of the price of a crude warship. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  These drones give the navy flexibility because they can be controlled using screens on board. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  They can be controlled from a few miles away on the land or they can even be controlled from the east coast of America. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=159.6s)]
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked a revolution in drone warfare. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=167.6s)]
*  Facing one of the world's strongest militaries, the Ukrainians used the cheap adaptable tech to their advantage. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=172.6s)]
*  It's estimated drones are now responsible for 80% of all damage they inflict on the battlefield. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=180.6s)]
*  Russia's caught up fast, but how about NATO? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=189.6s)]
*  So I think NATO is adapting. The challenge for us is really the pace of adaptation that is necessary in order to be competitive in the future. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=194.6s)]
*  And that is an area where I don't think any of us can be confident that we're moving fast enough. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=202.6s)]
*  Rear Admiral Mattis and his team are trying to speed things up. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  Testing and training on a range of drones, hoping to help quickly boost the US Navy and NATO's defences. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  So it's clear that the message here is NATO mustn't delay in preparing for a possible drone war. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  But that isn't an easy task. It will need to produce millions and millions of drones every year and they'll need to be updated every few months. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=233.0s)]
*  This is the reality of what a drone war demands. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=247.0s)]
*  In Ukraine, along both sides of the front line is an area controlled by drones called Death Valley. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=250.0s)]
*  Sending a soldier would be a suicide mission. It's estimated a tank can survive six minutes. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=259.2s)]
*  On the European continent at the moment there are only two military forces or armies battle tested with the ability to use millions of drones. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=267.2s)]
*  One is Russian, which is planning new aggressions, another one is Ukrainian. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=278.2s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine are now drone fighting experts. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=282.4s)]
*  The fear is in the next five years that expertise could be used by Putin's forces against a NATO country. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=286.4s)]
*  We shall face Russian army battle tested much stronger than it was back in 2022 and with ability to use millions of drones. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=295.4s)]
*  Survival demands an army of drones. This year Ukraine will make 4.5 million, three times as many as in 2024. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  It requires constant innovation, some of which is happening beyond Ukraine's borders. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  So I'm heading to southern Germany to meet some of the companies involved in the drone revolution. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  So as we're making our way now is a good opportunity for me to break down a little bit more how the military can use drones. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=329.8s)]
*  And when I say the word drone, probably a lot of people think about something like this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=336.8s)]
*  But actually unmanned machines can be used in the sky, on the land or on the sea and they have several main uses. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=341.8s)]
*  So there's surveillance and reconnaissance, attack, defence, logistics. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=350.8s)]
*  So that could be, for example, bringing troops food or medicine and they can clear mines. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=357.0s)]
*  Now the majority of drones that we're seeing being used in Ukraine at the moment are called first person view or FPV drones and they can cost as little as $500. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=363.0s)]
*  These are cheap off the shelf units which have been adapted to carry explosives, but they are really just the start. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=374.0s)]
*  Far from the trenches of Ukraine, war is being reimagined. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=387.0s)]
*  This German startup is developing attack drones for the battlefield. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=401.0s)]
*  They can carry a warhead powerful enough to destroy a tank and can travel at speeds of up to 250 kilometres an hour. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=407.0s)]
*  So colloquially we call these kamikaze drones, but in the business they call them loitering munitions. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=417.0s)]
*  And that's because you can fire this with a specific target and it will loiter in the air until it finds that target and then it can strike. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=423.0s)]
*  In Ukraine, drones like this live for hours, maybe days, then they're gone, replaced, upgraded and launched again. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=432.0s)]
*  So we can click and drag to set up your mission and then everything will be able to execute on its own. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=441.2s)]
*  One soldier can control a swarm of multiple units far from the danger of the front line. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=447.2s)]
*  Potentially you could have your own little army in the sky. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=453.2s)]
*  Exactly, you can have one, it's a force multiplier if you will, you have one operator able to command more than one of these strike units [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=458.2s)]
*  and be able to attack and engage multiple targets across the battlefield. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=466.4s)]
*  So what you see here is our tail wing and it's all made for easy handling for soldiers [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=471.4s)]
*  so you don't have to use any tools on the front line and you just plug in the rudders. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=479.4s)]
*  To stay ahead in the fight, the drones have to be easy to assemble. The tech quick to update. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=486.4s)]
*  It's not about if we want to do this, it's all about how our enemies want to do this and we have to react. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  So how far could the drone revolution go? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  Could machines totally replace man on the battlefield? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=504.59999999999997s)]
*  This Bavarian company supplies ground drones to Ukraine and Germany. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  It doesn't get cold, it doesn't get hungry, it doesn't get sick and it doesn't get tired. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=513.6s)]
*  This model can be used for everything from evacuating casualties, surveillance or as a mount for other weapons. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  Right now humans control every mission, but in the future could AI be making the decisions? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=525.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't see it happening anytime soon. I'm convinced that AI, if it's a really good trained model, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  will probably make more rational and data based decisions than any human will ever make. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=539.8000000000001s)]
*  Making an army of machines that choose when to kill humans, it feels like uncomfortable that thought. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=547.0s)]
*  Don't you think it's rather machines killing machines than machines killing humans? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=556.0s)]
*  In what way? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=560.0s)]
*  Because it will be drones on each side attacking each other. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=562.0s)]
*  But at the moment drones are killing humans. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=565.2s)]
*  This is the aftermath of a Russian swarm attack on Kiev. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=568.2s)]
*  It's a tactic where they send hundreds of attack drones to bombard the country in one night, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=573.2s)]
*  overwhelming air defences and leaving residents terrified. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=579.2s)]
*  Drones make a distinct sound and so you sit there and you second and you're like, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=584.2s)]
*  whether this one is going to hit you or is this one going to hit your family or your friends or loved ones. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=591.4000000000001s)]
*  22 year old Vladimir says people are now haunted by drones. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=598.4000000000001s)]
*  The attacks come mainly at night, leaving those who haven't taken cover at risk of dying in their beds. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=603.4000000000001s)]
*  Sleep deprived, they try to raise the alarm. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  So we have an app that basically allows you to report air targets. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=615.6s)]
*  So for example, if you see or hear a drone, you can press this button and it will send the report to the authorities. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=620.6s)]
*  Also, you can like, if you see or hear a rocket, you can report it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=627.6s)]
*  They try to stay positive, but the constant threat is draining. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=632.6s)]
*  Sometimes the first threat is the drone. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=637.6s)]
*  Sometimes the first things I hear in the morning from like my mother calls me to check on me is actually not a hello. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not a good morning. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=648.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not how you've been. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=650.8000000000001s)]
*  It's actually a question of whether you're still alive. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  This brings me like incredible sorrow. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=655.8000000000001s)]
*  It brings me incredible pain to hear my mother worry about every day. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=660.8000000000001s)]
*  To hear my mother worry about every day that Russia, we are constantly targeted. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=668.0s)]
*  In the hands of the enemy, they inspire terror. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=678.0s)]
*  But drones have also helped Ukrainian forces score victories like this. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=682.0s)]
*  Here they attacked air bases during Operation Spiderweb, taking out billions of pounds worth of Russian long range bombers. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=687.0s)]
*  And it's not just Russia and Ukraine. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=698.0s)]
*  Armies worldwide are now using drones. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=701.0s)]
*  The Israeli military released this footage of them shooting down Iranian units as both sides fired on each other. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=704.0s)]
*  While here, an Israeli quadcopter is filmed striking northern Gaza. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=713.0s)]
*  So how can NATO protect against this threat? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=721.0s)]
*  Well, this is one way. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=725.0s)]
*  Here they're shooting drones out of the sky. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=727.2s)]
*  NATO's chief has pledged to massively increase air defences as it boosts defence spending. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=730.2s)]
*  We see Russia's deadly terror from the skies over Ukraine every day. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=737.2s)]
*  And we must be able to defend ourselves from such attacks. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=742.2s)]
*  Another tactic is using jammers to break the link between drone and pilot, but fibre optic units are immune. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=745.2s)]
*  If we're talking about whether NATO would be ready for a possible drone war, we need to talk about how drones can be used to boost defence. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=753.4000000000001s)]
*  And one of the most ambitious ideas is the creation of a so-called drone wall along NATO's eastern flank. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=761.4000000000001s)]
*  Running from Norway to Poland, it would be around 3000 kilometres. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=768.4000000000001s)]
*  And if it got the go ahead, it would be the most expensive network of unmanned aerial vehicles. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=773.4000000000001s)]
*  Essentially a brigade of eyes in the sky constantly monitoring the borders with Belarus and Russia looking for threats which would then intercept or attack. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=780.6s)]
*  In the German countryside, they're testing the latest defence drones to send to Ukraine. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=798.6s)]
*  These don't just spot the enemy, they can also take them out. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=804.6s)]
*  This is our interceptor drone. It's actually mounted below the big drones that you see standing out here. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=808.8000000000001s)]
*  And we use this to actually intercept hostile drones at large distances. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=813.8000000000001s)]
*  Onboard radar allows them to detect the enemy up to five kilometres away, giving them more time to intercept. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  And that could be a game changer in an aerial drone battle, according to the makers. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=830.8000000000001s)]
*  If you can use drones in defence, at some point you have robots fighting robots that will hopefully ultimately also save lives. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=837.0s)]
*  How ready do you think NATO is if one of its countries was to be hit by a wave of drones like we're seeing in Ukraine? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=845.0s)]
*  We are absolutely not ready in my view. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=851.0s)]
*  I mean, Ukraine has on record that they produced like I think 1.3 million drones last year. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=854.0s)]
*  I would be surprised if NATO even bought like a thousand drones last year. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=860.0s)]
*  I think Germany has procured like, I don't know, 100, maybe 200. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=864.2s)]
*  So you can do math on what that means, how quickly you run out of drones. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=868.2s)]
*  Ukraine, if they consume those 1.3 million drones in a year, that's like what, 3,000 drones consumed per day. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=873.2s)]
*  So if you have 100 in your inventory, that will not last an hour. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=882.2s)]
*  The German Ministry of Defence say the figures don't closely reflect reality. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=887.2s)]
*  They add drones are a part of soldiers' daily routines and that they're investing in a range of models, including attack drones like this. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=892.4000000000001s)]
*  This is what it's already done. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=901.4000000000001s)]
*  And across the board, NATO's made producing and protecting against drones a priority. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=902.4000000000001s)]
*  Members like Britain will spend two billion on military units. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=909.4000000000001s)]
*  The UK's also announced a deal with Ukraine to co-produce drones. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=913.4000000000001s)]
*  A smart move, President Zelensky told Sky News in an exclusive interview. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=918.6s)]
*  But Russia's continued offensive is a wake-up call, a warning. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=942.6s)]
*  NATO knows it can't stockpile drones as they'll go out of date. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=948.6s)]
*  But Europe must be capable of making its own drone army in case of future attack. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=952.6s)]
*  Russians can have around 5 million drones. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=959.6s)]
*  So we need to have capacities bigger than those in order really to prevail. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=962.6s)]
*  So the question is about millions of drones. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=969.6s)]
*  It's very important now to start to build up, to develop teams of the people. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=972.8000000000001s)]
*  Engineers, constructors, operators, digital people, you know, ready to scale up production if the X is coming. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=979.8000000000001s)]
*  From the skies of Ukraine to the battlefields of the Middle East, drones are revolutionising warfare. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=992.8000000000001s)]
*  NATO must learn to lead that revolution or risk leaving itself exposed. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1000.0s)]
*  Fascinating but chilling stuff. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1010.0s)]
*  Someone who knows firsthand how drones are changing the nature of war [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1012.0s)]
*  and their devastating effects on the battlefield is Major Oleg Shariyev. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1016.0s)]
*  He's the commander of Ukraine's 225th Separate Assault Regiment. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1020.0s)]
*  I sat down with him a little earlier and asked just how important drones are for you. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1024.0s)]
*  How important drones are for Ukraine's army and what NATO may have to learn from that. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1028.2s)]
*  Have a listen. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1033.2s)]
*  It's difficult to say who's winning the war of the drones. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1037.2s)]
*  Ukraine was the first to use UAVs. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1040.2s)]
*  However, the Russians are progressing and they continue to come up with new solutions. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1042.2s)]
*  Half a year ago, they started the mass use of fibre optic drones. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1047.2s)]
*  So our adversary, the Russian Federation, is making progress and advancing tactically [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1051.2s)]
*  and is managing to move forward deep into our territory. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1057.4s)]
*  But they're also suffering huge losses in terms of the number of troops. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1060.4s)]
*  It's important to mention that they have more personnel, more military equipment and more drones. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1064.4s)]
*  They have a much larger population and production base [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1069.4s)]
*  which means they're able to continue to produce more than we are for their war effort. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1072.4s)]
*  But war means changes. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1077.4s)]
*  They do some things better than us but we try to keep up. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1079.4s)]
*  And in some areas, we do better than they. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1082.4s)]
*  And how much do you think of a threat that is to the rest of NATO, to other Western countries? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1085.6000000000001s)]
*  The Russians are now battle tested and battle hardened obviously in their use of drones against you. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1092.6000000000001s)]
*  Do you think if it ever came to a Russian attack on another Western country, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1098.6000000000001s)]
*  the West would be prepared for that? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1103.6000000000001s)]
*  My personal opinion is that the West will not be ready from the onset. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1109.6000000000001s)]
*  This war has been a unique experience that only Russia and Ukraine have learned from. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1113.8s)]
*  This is a modern war unlike any other war previously fought [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1117.8s)]
*  because of constant monitoring of the battlefield and using UAVs. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1121.8s)]
*  So I think if we model a possible conflict where Russia attacks the West [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1125.8s)]
*  in the initial stages, it will inflict heavy damage upon the West. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1129.8s)]
*  But knowing that the West is technologically superior, it will adapt. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1133.8s)]
*  So Ukrainian experience plus the technological capabilities of the West will bring us victory. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1139.0s)]
*  Major, you've been in the thick of some of the worst fighting in this war [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1144.0s)]
*  and you've won awards and be recognised for your leadership, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1147.0s)]
*  both the hero of Ukraine and the golden star, Acolytes. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1150.0s)]
*  Give us an idea of how terrifying it is to be involved in this very new kind of drone warfare [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1154.0s)]
*  and also if you don't get the support that you're looking for from the West, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1160.0s)]
*  how much are the Russians likely to start or continue pressing further West [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1164.2s)]
*  and be an even bigger threat to your country than they are already? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1170.2s)]
*  I started the war with the rank of a regular soldier, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1177.2s)]
*  which has given me unique insights and experience as to how war changes. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1179.2s)]
*  This is the third time that I've served in the army and the second war I've participated in. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1183.2s)]
*  The first was in 2014. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1188.2s)]
*  Of course, back then, different skills were needed and there were different problems to solve. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1191.4s)]
*  At first, war was more classic in many regards. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1196.4s)]
*  Now it is terrifying because we see 80% of wounded soldiers being inflicted by drones. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1199.4s)]
*  But the presence of infantry is still decisive, not unlike previous wars. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1205.4s)]
*  Our land is where the infantry is staying. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1210.4s)]
*  Only infantry can clear territory. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1212.4s)]
*  But as everything is now being controlled by drones and it is terrifying, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1215.4s)]
*  we're solving this problem by masking our positions with mesh [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1218.6000000000001s)]
*  and we're engaging in electronic warfare [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1221.6000000000001s)]
*  and teaching new recruits to shoot down drones with their SU's rifles. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1224.6000000000001s)]
*  If Ukraine stops receiving support from our Western partners, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1228.6000000000001s)]
*  in that case, Russia has the opportunity to advance. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1231.6000000000001s)]
*  However, we will keep standing and we will continue to solve this problem. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1235.6000000000001s)]
*  For us, it's an issue of honor and our territory. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1239.6000000000001s)]
*  Every Ukrainian soldier will be standing until the end. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJf2_dQxQT4&t=1242.6000000000001s)]
