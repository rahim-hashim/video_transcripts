Video Description: The Israeli military has said its investigation into the killing of aid workers in Gaza has found there were "several professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident".

A deputy commander will be dismissed for providing an "inaccurate report" and a commanding officer will be reprimanded following the military probe, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said, adding there was "no attempt to conceal the event".

# Israeli military fires deputy commander after investigation looks into deadly attack on aid workers
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y)
*  A professional failure. A series of operational mistakes. These are the findings of the Israeli [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=0.0s)]
*  military's investigation into its attack on a medical convoy in Gaza that killed 15 Palestinian [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=8.52s)]
*  aid workers. Israeli troops buried their bodies and the crushed vehicles in the sand. The [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=16.28s)]
*  military, under pressure to explain its actions, has released a statement. It says, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=24.24s)]
*  the deputy commander failed to identify the fire truck and ambulances, blaming it on poor [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  night visibility. He opened fire. The rest of the battalion followed. He has now been dismissed. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  The statement also said removing the bodies was reasonable under the circumstances, but the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=44.2s)]
*  decision to crush the vehicles was wrong and there was no attempt to conceal the event. At the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=50.88s)]
*  heart of the matter is the identities of those killed. Israel again claimed that six were members [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=58.28s)]
*  of Hamas, but it has provided no evidence of this. First of all, as the IDF said, and we've been [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=65.8s)]
*  gathering the evidence around this from the very beginning and taking our time to do so, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=72.4s)]
*  is that five or possibly six members of the people that were in that ambulance have links to Hamas. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=76.88s)]
*  Sky News own investigation didn't find any proof the medics were associated with Hamas. It was the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=83.16s)]
*  video found on the phone of one of the medics killed that provided the first real evidence of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=93.0s)]
*  what happened. It proved the convoy did have its lights on and medics were wearing high vis vests, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=98.36s)]
*  contradicting an earlier statement by the military. Israel's story has changed since [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=105.36s)]
*  the bodies were recovered and calls for an independent investigation are growing. There [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=111.36s)]
*  remains evidence that it may well be a war crime and it's something that should be investigated [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=117.92s)]
*  as a possible war crime and it should be investigated by the International Criminal Court, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=123.72s)]
*  which is the only international court capable of conducting a criminal investigation into [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=128.6s)]
*  something like this. The report that's been produced may engender in some people the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=134.8s)]
*  suspicion that it's a whitewash and what Israel needs to do right now is to take steps to avoid [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  that inference becoming a conclusion. In a briefing to journalists, the Israeli military [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=148.12s)]
*  said an hour before the convoy attack, it fired on a vehicle it thought was Hamas. It later [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=157.56s)]
*  discovered it wasn't. This investigation is no consolation for the families of the medics. The [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=164.24s)]
*  convoy had gone out looking for a missing ambulance and its crew. By the end of the night, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=174.28s)]
*  they too had all disappeared and never made it home. Nicole Johnston, Sky News, Jerusalem. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtjF2Vvg3Y&t=180.76000000000002s)]
