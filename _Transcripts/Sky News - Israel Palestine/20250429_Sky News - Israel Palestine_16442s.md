Video Description: The International Court of Justice hears arguments about what Israel must do to provide aid to Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.

Israel is facing accusations of breaking international law after completely cutting off all supplies to the 2.3 million residents of Gaza in March.
 
Israel says it will not allow the entry of goods and supplies into Gaza until Hamas releases all remaining hostages.

# World Court hears arguments against Israel's Gaza aid blockade | Day two
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk)
*  Good morning. The sitting is now open. The Court meets this morning to hear the following [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=0.0s)]
*  participants – South Africa, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Belgium and Colombia. Each of the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9.68s)]
*  delegations has been allocated 30 minutes for its presentation. The Court will observe [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=19.6s)]
*  a short break after the presentation of Saudi Arabia. I shall now give the floor to Mr. Zain [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=27.06s)]
*  Dango speaking on behalf of South Africa. Sir, you have the floor. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=34.78s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, it is an honour to appear before this Court on behalf [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=55.3s)]
*  of the Republic of South Africa. We appear before the Court pursuant to General Assembly [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=60.98s)]
*  Resolution 79-232, which requested an advisory opinion on the obligations of Israel in relation [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=66.42s)]
*  to the presence and activities of the United Nations and other international organisations [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  and third states. This resolution was initiated by Norway and supported overwhelmingly by [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=81.7s)]
*  member states. We make these submissions while Gaza is once again under a complete siege [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=88.34s)]
*  following Israel's breach of the ceasefire brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=95.98s)]
*  Israel has also intensified its aggression against Palestinians in the West Bank. Israel [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=103.26s)]
*  is blocking food, water and medicines, all of which are essential to life from entering [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=108.58s)]
*  Gaza. As cited in this Court yesterday, the United Nations Secretary-General stated that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=115.34s)]
*  Gaza is a killing field. He added, aid has dried up, the floodgates of horror have reopened. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=122.9s)]
*  On 11 April, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that Israel, and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=131.3s)]
*  I quote, appears to be inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life increasingly incompatible [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=137.06s)]
*  with a continued existence as a group in Gaza. Palestinian NGOs and major aid groups have [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=144.86s)]
*  warned that Gaza is entering into famine and that in the coming days, the country will [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=152.46s)]
*  be in a state of emergency. We wish to emphasise the impunity with which Israel is inflicting [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=197.06s)]
*  these harms. Israel continues to act with impunity as it does enjoy some form of exceptionalism [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=219.22s)]
*  from accountability to international law and norms. Conversely, any person or entity [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=226.66s)]
*  which seeks to hold Israel to account for its inhumane and unlawful actions is subjected [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=234.98s)]
*  to countermeasures and censure. The United Nations and this Court has not been spared. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=240.5s)]
*  In this context, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, UNRWA, which was established after the 1948 Nakba, is but one of Israel's latest casualties. UNRWA is being attacked in furtherance of Israel's goal to deny the inalienable right of return of Palestinian refugees, the restitution of their land, homes and property appropriated since 1948. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=251.12s)]
*  UNRWA is also deliberately imperiling the existence of Palestinians as a group. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=281.12s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, turning now to the Court's jurisdiction, South Africa considers that the Court's jurisdictional requirements have undoubtedly been met. In relation to judicial propriety, South Africa observes that the Court had in its 19 July 2024 advisory opinion dispensed with the arguments raised by some states in these proceedings. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=293.12s)]
*  The Court held that the arguments did not constitute compelling reasons to decline to give the advisory opinion then. The same reasoning should apply now. In the interest of brevity, South Africa will not repeat the Court's longstanding and clear jurisprudence on this aspect. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=319.12s)]
*  Providing an advisory opinion does not require the Court to prejudge elements relevant to the contentious proceedings in South Africa v. Israel, which South Africa argues, based on facts and law, that Israel is in breach of the Genocide Convention. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=337.12s)]
*  The question asked of the Court in the present matter concerns Israel's obligation as an occupying power and its obligations as a member of the United Nations, and specifically the legal consequences arising from its acts and omissions in these contexts. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=355.12s)]
*  The Court has extensive facts available to it by virtue of the dossier transmitted to it by the United Nations and the submissions made in writing by states. This is despite Israel imposing an information blackout, including through prohibiting the entry of international media and by killing journalists. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=372.12s)]
*  Israel is also denying access to the occupied Palestinian territory to UN agencies, persons and entities mandated by it to investigate Israel's violations of Palestinian rights. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=395.12s)]
*  Accepting Israel's argument under the circumstances that this Court has insufficient facts before it would be rewarding it for its own egregious conduct. Any further actions by Israel that censor remaining humanitarian organizations requiring access, UNRWA in particular, would contribute to rendering Israel's conduct unreviewable. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=408.12s)]
*  The international community cannot accept the reality in which an entire civil population is deliberately starved by Israel, where the United Nations is evicted and deprived of its immunities and privileges, where third states and humanitarian organizations are prevented from rendering humanitarian assistance in solidarity and in fulfillment of their over-harmness obligations. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=432.12s)]
*  Nor can we accept that journalists, aid workers and first responders are being assassinated and then hastily buried in mass graves. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=458.12s)]
*  The United Nations is rightly seized with this matter and calls for the Court's urgent advice on the questions put to it by the General Assembly. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=469.12s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, this brings to an end the first part of South Africa's oral submission. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=480.12s)]
*  I kindly request that the Court calls upon Ms. Noko Kanyajele, the Special Advisor to the President of the Republic of South Africa, on legal and international affairs, to address it on Israel's obligations as an occupying power. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=487.12s)]
*  I thank you for your attention. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=501.12s)]
*  I thank Mr. Dango. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=504.12s)]
*  I now give the floor to Ms. Noko Kanyajele and Ms. Judamplee. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=507.12s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, it is an honor and a privilege for me to appear before you this morning in the name of South Africa. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=519.12s)]
*  In an international legal order prohibiting the acquisition of territories by force, the rules of international law governing military occupation must necessarily be interpreted in favor of the rights of the occupied population. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=531.12s)]
*  The Gaza Strip and the Jordanian Sea, including East Jerusalem, remain under the military occupation of Israel, and the right of occupation applies to it in favor of the specialist Alex. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=550.12s)]
*  Starting with this postulate, the right of occupation imposes limits on the exercise... [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=563.12s)]
*  Should I begin again, Mr. President? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=580.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=582.12s)]
*  I shall do so, Mr. President. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=583.12s)]
*  I shall do so, Mr. President. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=610.12s)]
*  The Court, a set of regulatory powers based on exceptional and specifically numbered motives, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=640.12s)]
*  Israel is entitled to respect the life, rights and goods of the population of the occupied territory, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=649.12s)]
*  while the protected people cannot be deprived of the benefit of the Convention in any way by any change made by occupation. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=656.12s)]
*  In 2024, the Court declared that it was not, I quote, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=667.12s)]
*  "...convinced that the extension of the Israeli right to the Jordanian Sea and to East Jerusalem be justified by any of the motives stated in the second alinea of Article 64 of the Fourth Convention of Geneva." [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=671.12s)]
*  South Africa supports that the laws banning the use of a king should also be declared incompatible with this provision. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=689.12s)]
*  First of all, by means of these laws and their territorial application, directly to occupied Jerusalem, Israel is allegedly claiming its sovereignty over East Jerusalem. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=699.12s)]
*  Since the occupation's right does not transfer the title of sovereignty to the occupying power, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=712.12s)]
*  it is an additional measure by which Israel, as the Court considered it, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=720.12s)]
*  I quote, "...its progressive annexation of the Israeli territory and the application of these internal laws in the Zod's Edict, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=727.12s)]
*  thus hindering the exercise of the right to the self-determination of the Palestinian people." [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=736.12s)]
*  Secondly, the occupying power cannot exercise its limited powers in an incompatible manner with its other obligations, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=743.12s)]
*  as per the Convention, cited in great detail by Palestine in its interventions yesterday. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=753.12s)]
*  Israel cannot impose any specific measures prohibited by the international humanitarian law, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=760.12s)]
*  such as massive forced movements, the destruction of goods, the installation of colognes, the targeting of schools [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=767.12s)]
*  and even the targeting of school programs to erase the history of the Palestinian people. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=777.12s)]
*  Israel cannot make the population suffer these collective punishments, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=784.12s)]
*  while bombarding large-scale and without any discernment of the civil and civil property, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=790.12s)]
*  acts that are manifestly violations of its obligations as occupying power. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=796.12s)]
*  Thirdly, in the context of its duty to ensure public order, life and security of civilians, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=803.12s)]
*  Israel must act in accordance with its obligations, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=812.12s)]
*  in favor of the international humanitarian law and the international human rights law, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=816.12s)]
*  which give priority to the well-being of the Palestinian population. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=821.12s)]
*  It is, in particular, not to prevent, hinder or restrict the programs of collective aid [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=826.12s)]
*  that Israel must accept and facilitate in all its means, without reserve. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=834.12s)]
*  This includes the respect of privileges and immunity of the United Nations, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=843.12s)]
*  which undertakes such aid programs at the same time as the entry into the occupied Palestinian territory and the circulation in this territory. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=850.12s)]
*  Any dissolution of the almost state-owned institutions of Palestine, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=862.12s)]
*  including those administered by the UNRWA since 1949, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=868.12s)]
*  would risk leading to the complete collapse of public order and civil life [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=872.12s)]
*  and would constitute an act clearly intended to destroy the viability of the Palestinian state. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=877.12s)]
*  This would target the integral parties of the Palestinian system of housing, education and health care. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=884.12s)]
*  The dissolution of these institutions is forbidden by Article 47 of the Fourth Convention of Geneva. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=891.12s)]
*  In the context of its obligation to end, as quickly as possible, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=899.12s)]
*  its illegal presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=904.12s)]
*  Israel must end its illegal administration of circulation and entry into the occupied Palestinian territory [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=909.12s)]
*  in virtue of the just Ad Bellum. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=917.12s)]
*  Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen of the Court, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=920.12s)]
*  several States in their written statements have highlighted the obligations to make Israel [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=923.12s)]
*  in virtue of the Fourth Convention of Geneva. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=928.12s)]
*  Israel remains responsible for the first head of the execution of the obligations that it imposes on it [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=932.12s)]
*  in virtue of the provisions of this Convention. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=939.12s)]
*  No exception or reserve is planned in these provisions. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=942.12s)]
*  Article 69 of the first additional protocol broadens the nature of the goods that must be supplied [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=948.12s)]
*  given the local conditions. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=955.12s)]
*  These unconditional obligations include an obligation made to Israel [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=958.12s)]
*  not to stop the entry and the circulation of humanitarian aid personnel in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=963.12s)]
*  The occupying power cannot refuse to accept and facilitate the rapid transit of humanitarian aid [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=971.12s)]
*  personnel in its territory when it comes to aid and essential personnel for the survival of civilians. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=981.12s)]
*  The resolution 27.20 of the Security Council required the full implementation of the resolution 27.12 of 2023, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=989.12s)]
*  which demanded the flow of, I quote, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1000.12s)]
*  I quote, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1003.12s)]
*  The ordinance of this Court, from January 26, 28 March and 24 May 2024, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1033.12s)]
*  constitutes additional legal obligations for Israel to accept and facilitate the transit of humanitarian aid [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1040.12s)]
*  to the Gaza Strip, I quote, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1050.12s)]
*  in full cooperation with the United Nations, I quote. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1052.12s)]
*  However, Israel ignores in a flagrant manner its restrictive obligations. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1058.12s)]
*  On the contrary, a month and a half after the entry into force of its law prohibiting the use of a right, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1065.12s)]
*  Israel has doubled its aid deprivation by imposing a blockade of nearly eight weeks in Gaza. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1070.12s)]
*  South Africa has published two public files that expose in detail, among other things, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1078.12s)]
*  the denial by Israel of aid policy. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1083.12s)]
*  The UNRWA does not commit a, I quote, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1086.12s)]
*  of their written exposition, unilateral plagiarism and politicization, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1090.12s)]
*  but acts rather in accordance with the obligations that the United Nations General Assembly recognized as, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1096.12s)]
*  I quote, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1102.12s)]
*  a global defender of the protection and responsibility of Palestinian refugees, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1103.12s)]
*  I quote, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1110.12s)]
*  as well as the usual obligations of the UN to not recognize the illegal presence of the State of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory as legal. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1111.12s)]
*  The allegations of Israel are calculated and deliberated in a context in which Israel imposed a general prohibition [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1121.12s)]
*  to all humanitarian organizations and to the continuation of humanitarian aid to Gaza by state-owned companies. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1130.12s)]
*  This includes new restrictive procedures aimed at blocking more all humanitarian organizations operating in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1137.12s)]
*  Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen of the Court, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1149.12s)]
*  South Africa values that the people of the occupied territory always maintain their sovereignty. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1153.12s)]
*  The people of Palestine, through the means of their representatives designated, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1159.12s)]
*  have agreed to receive humanitarian aid, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1165.12s)]
*  as well as to the presence and activities of the UN and State-owned companies in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1169.12s)]
*  The right to occupation, and in particular the Articles 59 to 61 of the Fourth Convention of Geneva, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1176.12s)]
*  does not require the consent of an occupying power in the event that the civilian population is not sufficiently provided. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1184.12s)]
*  It is therefore the right to occupation, and in particular the Articles 55 to 61 of the Fourth Convention of Geneva, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1194.12s)]
*  which are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1201.12s)]
*  imposing Israel not only to, I quote, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1204.12s)]
*  to allow, but I quote, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1207.12s)]
*  to ensure the supply of aid and basic services. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1210.12s)]
*  In addition, the Article 11 of the Fourth Convention of Geneva clearly envisions a role for humanitarian organizations [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1215.12s)]
*  as a substitute for the protective powers of the protected civilian population. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1224.12s)]
*  The United Nations has continued to play a role of protection of the Palestinian people, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1231.12s)]
*  which had seen itself guaranteeing full self-determination with the status of Class A mandate, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1236.12s)]
*  and which was then dispossessed of its territory and displaced by force during the Nakba in 1948, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1243.12s)]
*  which required the creation of UNRWA to guarantee the rights of refugee Palestinians, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1250.12s)]
*  including the rights of more than 70% of the Palestinians of Gaza, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1257.12s)]
*  who are systematically deprived of their right to return to their homes. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1262.12s)]
*  In the context of its illegal occupation, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1267.12s)]
*  Israel does not worry about leaving its obligations as an occupying power, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1270.12s)]
*  but seeks to usurp rights in an abusive manner. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1275.12s)]
*  The actions and omissions of Israel clearly violate the right to occupation as a whole, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1280.12s)]
*  and we would not be able to allow the persistence of these serious violations of the humanitarian international law. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1286.12s)]
*  Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen of the Court, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1294.12s)]
*  the second part of the South African Trial is closing. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1297.12s)]
*  Mr. President, allow me to ask you to invite Mr. Jameon Hendricks, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1301.12s)]
*  the legal advisor of the State in International Law, to present the conclusions of South Africa. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1307.12s)]
*  Thank you, Madame Gillet. I now invite Mr. Jameon Hendricks to address the Court. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1319.12s)]
*  You have the floor, sir. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1324.12s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1338.12s)]
*  it is an honor to appear before you on behalf of the Republic of South Africa. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1341.12s)]
*  International law prohibits Israel from the use of starvation as a method of warfare, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1347.12s)]
*  including under siege or blockade. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1354.12s)]
*  Israel may not collectively punish the protected Palestinian population, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1358.12s)]
*  which it holds under unlawful occupation. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1363.12s)]
*  The UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, in his report of 17 July 2024, stated, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1366.12s)]
*  starvation reflects a state's fundamental abandonment of its human rights obligations, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1375.12s)]
*  and further, that the State of Israel has deployed the full range of techniques of hunger and starvation, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1383.12s)]
*  perfecting the degree of control, suffering and death that it can cause through food systems, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1391.12s)]
*  leading to this moment of genocide. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1398.12s)]
*  Despite the horrific attempts by Israeli officials to characterize them otherwise, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1402.12s)]
*  Palestinians are human beings. They are flesh and blood. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1409.12s)]
*  Palestinian people are entitled to the same fundamental protections as we in this great hall of justice. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1415.12s)]
*  And this includes the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of life, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1423.12s)]
*  the supreme right from which no derogation is permitted, even in situations of armed conflict. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1429.12s)]
*  Israel's humanitarian blockade, including its ban of UNRWA, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1436.12s)]
*  renders the Palestinian population significantly less resilient to Israel's acquisition of territory by force and of its genocide. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1441.12s)]
*  In so doing, Israel is breaching the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1452.12s)]
*  a peremptory norm of international law enshrined in the UN Charter [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1459.12s)]
*  and Common Article 1 of the International Covenants on Human Rights. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1464.12s)]
*  Furthermore, Israel is impeding the United Nations and third states from exercising their ergo omnes obligations [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1469.12s)]
*  and international solidarity with respect to the exercise of the fundamental human rights of the Palestinian people, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1478.12s)]
*  which this Court held to include the right to self-determination. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1486.12s)]
*  In relation to Israel's obligations towards the United Nations, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1491.12s)]
*  the 1946 General Convention provides for no exceptions to the inviolability of the United Nations, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1496.12s)]
*  which applies equally in times of peace and in armed conflict. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1503.12s)]
*  States are under a legal obligation to protect the inviolability of all UN premises and property, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1509.12s)]
*  wherever located and by whom ever held. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1517.12s)]
*  Israel must therefore cooperate in good faith with the United Nations and render it every assistance. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1523.12s)]
*  And despite its abrogation of its bilateral and operational agreement with UNRWA, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1530.12s)]
*  Israel's obligations under the UN Charter and the General Convention prevail. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1536.12s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, turning now to the legal consequences which flow from the question before the Court. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1542.12s)]
*  South Africa submits that Israel's unlawful occupation and its aforementioned violations of the remtary norms of international law [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1551.12s)]
*  constitute internationally wrongful acts attributable to the State of Israel. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1559.12s)]
*  This necessarily invokes the law of state responsibility. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1565.12s)]
*  Israel must therefore immediately cease its internationally wrongful acts and make reparation in full, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1570.12s)]
*  including the restitution, compensation and satisfaction. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1577.12s)]
*  Israel must comply with its obligations as an occupying power to ensure food and medical supplies [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1583.12s)]
*  and facilitate the unhindered provision of humanitarian goods, essential services and development assistance [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1589.12s)]
*  by the UN, third states and other international organizations. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1598.12s)]
*  It must fully seize hostilities to ensure their ability to deliver assistance. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1603.12s)]
*  Israel must comply with this Court's binding provisional measures in South Africa versus Israel [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1610.12s)]
*  and take effective measures to ensure, without delay and in full cooperation with the United Nations, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1620.12s)]
*  the unhindered provision at scale and by all concerned of urgently needed basic services [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1628.12s)]
*  and humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1636.12s)]
*  Finally, Israel must immediately reverse its decision to expel UNRWA and other UN bodies from carrying out their mandated activities. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1640.12s)]
*  Turning to the obligations on the United Nations. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1651.12s)]
*  The United Nations and its bodies are under a duty not to recognize Israel's internationally wrongful acts, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1655.12s)]
*  such as its unlawful eviction of UNRWA and its unlawful of powers reserved for the legitimate sovereign in Palestine. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1663.12s)]
*  And despite Israeli restrictions, the UN and its agencies, including UNRWA, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1672.12s)]
*  must continue to render humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1678.12s)]
*  It must demand and negotiate for the removal of barriers imposed by Israel. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1683.12s)]
*  Turning to the obligations on third states. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1689.12s)]
*  Third states have an obligation not to recognize as lawful Israel's internationally wrongful acts, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1693.12s)]
*  including its banning of UNRWA, not to maintain these acts and to collaborate to bring such acts to an end. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1701.12s)]
*  It is imperative that third states refrain from providing arms which enable Israel's continued breaches of international law in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1710.12s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the court, in conclusion, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1723.12s)]
*  South Africa shares the UN Secretary General's view that the world has failed the Palestinian people. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1729.12s)]
*  The only certainty they have is that tomorrow will be worse. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1738.12s)]
*  Therefore, we must save whatever is left of our humanity by ending Israel's unlawful settler colonial occupation [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1744.12s)]
*  and its intentional starving of the Palestinian population while being systematically brutalized and deprived of the most elementary considerations of humanity. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1754.12s)]
*  Palestinians look to the world and to this Court for an end to their enduring loss, their pain and their suffering. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1766.12s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, this brings to an end South Africa's oral submission. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1776.12s)]
*  I wish to thank the Court for your attention. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1783.12s)]
*  I thank the representatives of South Africa for their presentation. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1786.12s)]
*  I now invite the delegation of Algeria to speak and call for Madame Maya Saleh Fadel. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1792.12s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1823.12s)]
*  Mr. President, allow me first of all, in the name of my country, Algeria, and the delegation that accompanies me, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1829.12s)]
*  to congratulate you on your accession to the presidency of this August institution. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1837.12s)]
*  It is also a privilege for me to address myself in front of you in the name of my country [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1844.12s)]
*  and to present the oral submission in the context of the consultation procedure relating to the request of the United Nations General Assembly on December 19, 2024. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1850.12s)]
*  I will start with some introductory and factual words. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1862.12s)]
*  Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Court, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1867.12s)]
*  Without going back to all the factual elements that have already been the subject of wide development in the various written memorandums submitted to the current Court, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1872.12s)]
*  Algeria should remember that nearly 6 million Palestinian refugees are registered with UNROA. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1883.12s)]
*  The agency manages 58 refugee camps and 711 schools, attended by 550,000 students. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1893.12s)]
*  UNROA manages 141 primary health care centres. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1902.12s)]
*  It also provides a social security network of nearly 332,763 people, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1908.12s)]
*  in addition to teaching and technical and professional training to 7,811 young people and to pay microfinance loans to 27,199 clients. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1917.12s)]
*  Since March 2, 2025, a deliberate blockade decided by the Israeli occupier prevents the expansion of any food aid in Gaza, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1930.12s)]
*  leaving a Palestinian population confronted with hunger and the lack of means of subsistence of primary necessity. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1942.12s)]
*  As highlighted by UNROA's Commissioner General, we are witnessing a famine caused by man and motivated by political considerations. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1950.12s)]
*  The recent massacre of 15 Palestinian rescuers and ambulances whose bodies were found in a common grave triggered a worldwide indignation, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1964.12s)]
*  but all in the midst of the silence of numerous attacks against women and children in the Palestinian territory occupied. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1976.12s)]
*  Algeria recalls that the desperate situation in Gaza and the blockade of humanitarian aid are now used as a currency of exchange and a weapon of war. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1986.12s)]
*  Israel's behavior towards UNROA is much prior to the offensive in Gaza since October 2023. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=1997.12s)]
*  Nevertheless, the attacks perpetrated since remain unprecedented. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2007.12s)]
*  Israel has attacked staff and destroyed the premises, goods and facilities belonging to UNROA, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2012.12s)]
*  also took for a target and killed and detained staff of this agency. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2022.12s)]
*  These elements demonstrate that Israel has been leading a long-standing policy aimed at hindering UNROA's original mandate. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2028.12s)]
*  The adoption of the two Israeli laws of October 28, 2024 still perpetuates the blockades already mentioned. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2037.12s)]
*  Such behavior is incompatible with the obligations of Israel as an occupying power and member of the United Nations. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2045.12s)]
*  The UNROA is in total contradiction with the rules stated in the UN Convention on Privileges and Immunity. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2054.12s)]
*  From a legal point of view, UNROA has a unique mandate concerning the essential aspects of the Palestinian issue, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2062.12s)]
*  namely the right to return Palestinian refugees and the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2070.12s)]
*  In addition, Algeria should remember that Israel is committed to respecting the privileges and immunities that UNROA has rights to, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2080.12s)]
*  including the immunity of its jurisdiction and the inviolability of its premises, goods, funds, facilities and equipment. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2089.12s)]
*  The privileges and immunity of UNROA are absolute and cannot be limited, restricted or removed for reasons such as the hostility of camp 8. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2099.12s)]
*  I will develop the Algerian thesis around four points. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2109.12s)]
*  The first point will be, of course, after these introductory points, to analyze the obligations of Israel as a member of the United Nations and occupying power. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2115.12s)]
*  The third point will be the analysis of the illegality of Israeli laws on October 28, 2024. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2126.12s)]
*  The fourth point will be on the violations by Israel of its obligations and the implementation of its international responsibility. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2134.12s)]
*  As for the obligations of Israel as a member of the United Nations and occupying power, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2143.12s)]
*  To address the issue of the obligations of Israel, we must first analyze these obligations from the perspective of the international public law, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2150.12s)]
*  reflected in the UN Charter, the relevant international conventions and resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2161.12s)]
*  As for the specialist law, these obligations must be identified in the corpus of the international humanitarian law and the international human rights law. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2172.12s)]
*  Without returning to the factual elements, having made the subject of previous development, it seems unquestionable for Algeria that Israel as a member of the United Nations, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2182.12s)]
*  but also as an occupying power, could not claim unlimited appreciation for the activities of the UN, of its different bodies and organisms, including UNRWA. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2193.12s)]
*  The obligation of Israel to cooperate with the UN as it comes from the Charter is recalled by the Court in its ordinance in indication of conservative measures on March 28, 2024, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2205.12s)]
*  which is to make South Africa opposed to Israel, according to which Israel, I quote, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2218.12s)]
*  must take all necessary and effective measures to ensure without delay, in close cooperation with the UN, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2224.12s)]
*  to ensure without restriction and on a large scale, the supply by all parties interested, basic services and humanitarian aid required urgently. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2233.12s)]
*  As a result, Algeria supports that, on the basis of its obligation to respect the principles of the UNESCO and in particular the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2245.12s)]
*  Israel is in the obligation not to prevent, to hinder or restrict in any other way the presence and activities of UNRWA in the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2256.12s)]
*  We will address these different obligations around three points. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2271.12s)]
*  First, the obligations of Israel as a member of the United Nations, in accordance with the Charter and other relevant texts. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2275.12s)]
*  Articles 2, 5, 100, 103, 104 and 105 of the Charter of the United Nations are the foundation of the obligations of Israel in terms of the presence and activities of the UN, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2284.12s)]
*  its organs, including UNRWA, other organizations and states in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2298.12s)]
*  These obligations include the duty to cooperate and facilitate their activities, as well as the duty to respect the privileges and immunities they must claim, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2309.12s)]
*  while reminding, likewise, that Israel is part of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations and that the field of application of this Convention has been explicitly extended to the occupied Palestinian territory by the Concluded Agreement between Israel and UNRWA in 1967. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2320.12s)]
*  As the UN Secretary General reminded her in his letter on December 9, 2024, on the obligations of Israel as part of Article 2, paragraph 5 of the Charter, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2338.12s)]
*  in regards to UNRWA, I quote, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2349.12s)]
*  As a member of the United Nations, Israel continues to be held, in accordance with Article 2, paragraph 5 of the Charter of the United Nations, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2352.12s)]
*  to provide UNRWA with all possible assistance in all its actions, in accordance with the relevant decisions of the competent principal bodies adopted by the Charter. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2361.12s)]
*  Please speak more slowly to facilitate the work of the interpreter. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2379.12s)]
*  This is how, in the virtue of Article 2, paragraph 5, 100 and 104 of the Charter of the United Nations, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2410.12s)]
*  Israel is held to facilitate UNRWA operations in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2419.12s)]
*  I now come to the second point, the obligations of Israel as an occupying power. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2428.12s)]
*  One of the elements of the question submitted to the Court by the General Assembly in its resolution 79-232 concerns the obligations of Israel as an occupying power, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2434.12s)]
*  in particular to ensure and facilitate, without hindrance, the essential supplies for the survival of the civilian population in the occupied territory, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2447.12s)]
*  in accordance with the humanitarian international law and the international human rights law. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2458.12s)]
*  The applicability of the international humanitarian law, both conventional and customary, in the occupied Palestinian territory is indisputable and is of paramount importance. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2463.12s)]
*  It is on the basis of Article 43 of the AED Regulation that constitutes the starting point of the obligations of Israel as an occupying power [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2475.12s)]
*  and which allows to ensure and facilitate, without hindrance, the establishment of essential supplies for the survival of the Palestinian population, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2485.12s)]
*  the basic services, humanitarian aid and development for the benefit of the Palestinian population. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2495.12s)]
*  These obligations are in Israel's hands. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2501.12s)]
*  Algeria considers that Israel has the obligation to respect and make the Geneva Conventions respected under any circumstances, as the Court has specified. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2505.12s)]
*  I quote, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2516.12s)]
*  This obligation does not only come from the conventions themselves, but from the general principles of humanitarian law, whose conventions are only the concrete expression. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2517.12s)]
*  The fundamental obligation, which was stated in Article 59 of the Fourth Convention of Geneva, relating to collective aid, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2529.12s)]
*  is also established in Article 55 of the 10th Convention relating to the resettlement of populations. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2570.12s)]
*  If Israel, occupying power, has a certain margin of appreciation in the acceptance and facilitation of humanitarian aid, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2576.12s)]
*  in particular in the choice of humanitarian actors, it is fundamental, as stated in Article 59 of the Fourth Convention, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2585.12s)]
*  that they take into account the concrete needs of the population of the occupied Palestinian territory and operational possibilities that allow to provide effective aid. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2593.12s)]
*  In view of the disastrous humanitarian situation in Gaza, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2604.12s)]
*  and the fact that UNRWA is the main provider of humanitarian aid and essential services in the occupied Palestinian territory, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2608.12s)]
*  significantly reduces the margin of appreciation that Israel has in the execution of this obligation. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2616.12s)]
*  Mr. President, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2625.12s)]
*  Algeria considers that Israel, as occupying power, is held, as long as this situation persists, to grant humanitarian access to UNRWA [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2626.12s)]
*  and to do everything to facilitate its aid activities in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2637.12s)]
*  Algeria has seen with surprise that the situation in Palestinian territories, and especially in Gaza, is one of the worst humanitarian failures of our generation. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2643.12s)]
*  Each person in Gaza depends on humanitarian aid to survive. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2654.12s)]
*  This vital link has been completely broken since a total blockade on aid was imposed by Israeli authorities on March 2 of the current year. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2659.12s)]
*  We are living in a moment of unprecedented crisis, which may lead to a humanitarian collapse. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2671.12s)]
*  In addition to the violations of humanitarian international law, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2679.12s)]
*  the Israeli practices that hinder the presence and activities of the United Nations, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2684.12s)]
*  other international organizations and state-owned organizations in the occupied Palestinian territory, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2689.12s)]
*  as well as the provision of aid and assistance, are much more involved in Israeli policy [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2694.12s)]
*  aimed at perpetuating its illegal presence in the occupied Palestinian territory [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2701.12s)]
*  and to participate in a progressive manner in the expulsion, transfer, forced movement of the Palestinian people out of the occupied Palestinian territory [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2707.12s)]
*  and legitimize the expulsion of an UN agency, of a UNRWA. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2718.12s)]
*  This is done by accentuating the suffering of the Palestinians in the absence of essential services. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2723.12s)]
*  Humanitarian aid should never be used as a political tool or a weapon of war. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2729.12s)]
*  Saving lives should never be a controversial issue. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2735.12s)]
*  The principles and rules of international law developed over the centuries to protect civilians should not be wavered, and impunity should not be disturbed. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2740.12s)]
*  Only the right to occupation should still be applied. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2751.12s)]
*  Third point of my presentation, analyze Israel against the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2755.12s)]
*  The Court has repeatedly stated that the right to self-determination constitutes one of the essential principles of contemporary international law [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2765.12s)]
*  and that the obligation to respect this right is a Hergahomenes principle. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2775.12s)]
*  All States have a legal interest in protecting them. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2780.12s)]
*  The Court has considered in its opinion of July 19, 2024, that, I quote, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2784.12s)]
*  the dependence of the West Bank of Jordan, of East Jerusalem and in particular of Ra'sa against Israel for the supply of essential goods and services, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2789.12s)]
*  compromises the jouissance of fundamental rights, including the right to self-determination. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2799.12s)]
*  Algeria recalls the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, which recognized the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2805.12s)]
*  including its right to create its own independent State and have announced a number of obligations towards Israel. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2814.12s)]
*  The creation of a law participates in the realization of inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2822.12s)]
*  At the end of the procedure, the obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2829.12s)]
*  carries for Israel the obligation to cooperate in order to allow the realization of this right to the benefit of the Palestinian people, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2836.12s)]
*  to ensure that humanitarian aid and assistance are facilitated, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2844.12s)]
*  to also ensure that this aid participates in the development of the right to self-determination and constitutes a true humanitarian imperative. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2849.12s)]
*  However, this inalienable right, the principle of Jusco Jens, is a perpetual denial of Israel. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2858.12s)]
*  As a reminder, on July 18, 2024, on the eve of the same course of the consultation of July 2024, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2865.12s)]
*  the Knesset adopted a declaration opposing the creation of a Palestinian State, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2874.12s)]
*  a declaration that once again is in flagrant violation of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2880.12s)]
*  Mr. President, before I finish my remarks and give the floor to Professor Samia Burouba, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2887.12s)]
*  we would like to underline, given the violations committed by Israel, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2894.12s)]
*  that we are witnessing an absence of effective reaction from the international community. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2899.12s)]
*  Despite the constant calls of the Secretary General of the UN, the Commissioner General of UNRWA, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2905.12s)]
*  and the support of humanitarian actors from certain third-party states, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2912.12s)]
*  we are witnessing an absence of action from the international community [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2916.12s)]
*  and a presence of a community of interest at the detriment of the Palestinian people [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2921.12s)]
*  of these most elementary rights, of their existence, of their future and of their future. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2926.12s)]
*  Annihilating UNRWA comes back today to annihilating the right of the Palestinian people to exist, to survive, to return to their land. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2932.12s)]
*  The ban on UNRWA by Israel is a way to destroy the present and the future of the Palestinian people. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2941.12s)]
*  Abandoning this agency is abandoning the Palestinian people and devoting a two-fold policy to the misuse of international law, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2948.12s)]
*  the decisions of this high court, international legality and principles of equality and justice dedicated to the UN Charter, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2957.12s)]
*  which I remind you that the content was finalized 80 years ago, on April 26, 1945, and we are on April 29, 2025. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2966.12s)]
*  Allow me, Mr. President, after concluding my remarks, to invite and give the floor to Professor Sami Abou-Rouba [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2977.12s)]
*  for the continuation of the oral exhibition of Algeria. Thank you. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2987.12s)]
*  I thank you, Mrs. Salifadell. I now give the floor to Mrs. Sami Abou-Rouba. Mrs. I beg you. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=2992.12s)]
*  Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Court, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3008.12s)]
*  The third part of this oral exhibition on the illegality of the two Israeli laws of October 28, 2024, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3013.12s)]
*  constitutes for Algeria the most clear manifestation of the disrespect for Israel for its international obligations. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3022.12s)]
*  The attacks against the locals and the staff of UNRWA and the obstructions made to their humanitarian actions, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3031.12s)]
*  which were not enough, have brought Israel back to its usual practice, to legislate against international law. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3040.12s)]
*  A brief observation on the two Israeli laws is imposed. They will be reported in the form and in the form. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3052.12s)]
*  As for the form, the title of the two laws adopted on the same day is edifying. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3064.12s)]
*  They themselves carry their own illegality. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3070.12s)]
*  I remind you that the first one is entitled, I quote, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3075.12s)]
*  The second one is entitled, I quote, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3081.12s)]
*  The intitles are written in the letter and their insights first reflect the intention of Israel to put an end to the presence [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3094.12s)]
*  the presence and activities of the UN General Assembly and to expand its application in [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3104.12s)]
*  the occupied Palestinian territory. The other fact that is being called up is the [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3113.12s)]
*  title of the Second Law, which confirms Israel's obsession with occupying, or even annexing, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3120.7599999999998s)]
*  the East Jerusalem, which denies its condemnation in the consultative reports of 2004 and 2024, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3127.76s)]
*  as well as in the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3137.44s)]
*  The entry into force of the two laws on January 30, 2025, shows that the urgency is there [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3143.44s)]
*  for Israel, not the one that comes from the obligation to stop the distress of the Palestinian [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3150.5200000000004s)]
*  refugees, aggravated by months of deprivation of its most basic needs, but to complete the [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3158.2400000000002s)]
*  company committed since the last military operation to put an end to the presence and [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3166.1200000000003s)]
*  activities of the UN General Assembly. Main organization set up by the UN along the [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3173.5200000000004s)]
*  course of the ANECBA to assist the Palestinian refugees deprived of their most basic rights [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3181.2s)]
*  and rights, including their right to return and to the building of a Palestinian state. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3191.96s)]
*  In the end, the first element that points out the non-conformity of the two laws to the [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3196.96s)]
*  obligations of Israel from the point of view of Algeria is the fact of suppressing the measures [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3204.0s)]
*  taken by a unilateral act on international obligations freely agreed, measures including [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3210.48s)]
*  respectively the first article, which pronounces the end of the exchange of letters of 1967, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3219.32s)]
*  the second article, which forbids all Israeli authorities to contact the agency and the [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3226.32s)]
*  three who predict that this law does not exclude the criminal pursuits against the employees [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3233.32s)]
*  of the office. I will move on to the second point of this third part, legal consequences [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3240.32s)]
*  of the implementation of the two laws in the Palestinian territory occupied. It is about [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3248.0800000000004s)]
*  considering this application, including the three parties that constitute the Palestinian [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3253.6800000000003s)]
*  territory occupied, which will allow to highlight the disrespect for Israel, member of the United [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3259.44s)]
*  Nations and occupying power of its obligations. In the Gaza Strip, first, Algeria puts a particular [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3266.64s)]
*  emphasis on the humanitarian repercussions of the implementation of Israeli laws in the [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3273.64s)]
*  view of the situation of this part of the territory occupied by Israel and the general [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3278.84s)]
*  population. Without too late, we can easily measure the effects of the unlawful use of [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3285.84s)]
*  the UNRWA, the deprivation of the Gaza Strip population of any aid concerning the products [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3292.84s)]
*  of primary needs and basic services. In East Jerusalem, on the date of April 8, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3296.84s)]
*  according to the UNRWA report, Israeli officials from the Education of the municipality of [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3304.84s)]
*  Jerusalem accompanied by Israeli forces entered into force in six schools of the agency [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3310.84s)]
*  with a closing order that will take effect in the next 30 days, that is, the next 8 [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3317.84s)]
*  May. This closing order, which will lead to the deprivation of 800 students, constitutes [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3324.84s)]
*  for Israel a violation of its obligations to respect the inviolability of the locals [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3330.84s)]
*  of international organizations. In West Jordan, the effect of the laws will mainly affect [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3336.84s)]
*  the prohibition that will put to death the right to education and the right to health. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3343.84s)]
*  For Algeria, the two Israeli laws, which are in fact hit with nullity, could not end [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3350.84s)]
*  in a unilateral manner to the obligations of Israel, as a result of the 1967 letter exchange. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3358.84s)]
*  The verbal note dated January 8, 2025, addressed by the Secretary General of the United Nations, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3366.84s)]
*  I quote, Israel remains committed to granting the UNRWA all the privileges, immunity and [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3374.84s)]
*  facilitation provided by the current General Convention and confirmed in the letter exchange [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3383.84s)]
*  as long as the UNRWA operates in the occupied Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3389.84s)]
*  The fourth part of this presentation will briefly highlight the violations by Israel of its [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3396.84s)]
*  obligations and the implementation of its international responsibility. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3403.84s)]
*  The violations can be grouped into three categories. First, violations of the obligation [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3408.84s)]
*  to provide the articles of primary necessity and basic services. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3415.84s)]
*  Algeria has recalled the various Israeli violations, including the decision of March 2, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3421.84s)]
*  the current year, and while the ceasefire is in force, to suspend any entry of goods [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3426.84s)]
*  and supplies in the Gaza Strip, deprived of this effect of food, drinking water, shelter [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3433.84s)]
*  and medical care. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3440.84s)]
*  Then, violations of the obligation to provide humanitarian aid and development aid. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3444.84s)]
*  Due to restrictions imposed by Israel, which have already been mentioned, having caused [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3450.84s)]
*  a spectacular decline in humanitarian aid, through several resolutions, including the [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3456.84s)]
*  resolution 2730 of 2024, the Security Council has put emphasis on the violations. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3463.84s)]
*  Regarding aid to development now, it goes without saying for Algeria that the Israeli [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3474.84s)]
*  violations, including the supply of the articles of primary necessity and the continuation [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3479.84s)]
*  of humanitarian aid, have greatly contributed to the deterioration of the social and economic [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3484.84s)]
*  situation already precarious to the Palestinian people. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3491.84s)]
*  The statement of the administrator of the UNRWA sums up the impoverishment of the Palestinian [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3497.84s)]
*  population. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3503.84s)]
*  I quote, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3504.84s)]
*  The projections of this new evaluation confirm that amid immediate suffering and horrible [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3505.84s)]
*  losses in human lives, a serious development crisis is taking place. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3512.84s)]
*  A crisis that compromises the future of the Palestinians for generations to come. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3520.84s)]
*  End of quote. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3526.84s)]
*  Algeria will not add more. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3528.84s)]
*  The last point, finally, is the violations of the Palestinian people's right to determination. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3531.84s)]
*  A right well spread by the various proposals. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3538.84s)]
*  I would just like to consider that the violations by Israel of these obligations regarding the [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3543.84s)]
*  presence and activities of the United Nations and all organizations that comprise this [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3552.84s)]
*  absolute right. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3559.84s)]
*  If all paths lead to Rome, there is only one path that must lead the Palestinian people [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3561.84s)]
*  to their dignity. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3568.84s)]
*  It is that of their right to self-determination. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3570.84s)]
*  Fourth underpinning, it is the fact of engaging the international responsibility of Israel [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3575.84s)]
*  for these violations. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3582.84s)]
*  It is based on the various articles contained in the articles of the international law commission [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3584.84s)]
*  relating to the international responsibility of the state for international facts. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3591.84s)]
*  They cite them, which are imputable to Israel for the fact of the various violations. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3598.84s)]
*  I would just like to mention the international responsibility of Israel, which is engaged [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3606.84s)]
*  in virtue of article 41 concerning the serious violation of the rule of the Jusqu'o Jens, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3612.84s)]
*  which is the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3618.84s)]
*  To conclude, Algeria reiterates the demands expressed in its written exposition and took [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3622.84s)]
*  the court to declare that Israel violates its legal obligations as a member of the UN [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3628.84s)]
*  regarding the organization and as an occupying power. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3634.84s)]
*  Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, members of the court, thank you for your attention. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3638.84s)]
*  I thank the representatives of Algeria for their presentation. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3648.84s)]
*  I now invite the delegation of Saudi Arabia to make its oral statement, and I call upon [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3654.84s)]
*  Mr. Mohammed Zaud Al Nasser to take the floor. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3661.84s)]
*  You have the floor, sir. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3666.84s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished members of the court, it's an honor for me to appear before you [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3680.84s)]
*  to present my country's views on a matter of critical importance for the United Nations, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3687.84s)]
*  all states, and in particular, for the Palestinian people. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3693.84s)]
*  Mr. President, on behalf of my country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I would like first [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3699.84s)]
*  to congratulate you on assuming the presidency of this court. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3705.84s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished members of the court, less than a year ago, the court held [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3712.84s)]
*  that Israel's policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territory, including [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3718.84s)]
*  its settlement practice, its continuing occupation, and its annexation of parts of that territory [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3724.84s)]
*  are flagrant violations of international law that must be brought to an end as a matter of urgency. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3731.84s)]
*  The court's ruling marked a clear path for Israel to follow and finally bringing itself [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3739.84s)]
*  into international legality. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3745.84s)]
*  Sadly, but predictably, Israel chose to ignore the court's ruling, showing that it considered [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3748.84s)]
*  itself above the law. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3757.84s)]
*  Outrage over Israel's conduct, particularly since October 2023, has been a major threat [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3761.84s)]
*  to the United Nations. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3767.84s)]
*  The UN General Assembly has compelled the UN General Assembly to return to the court [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3769.84s)]
*  to seek its guidance on another pressing matter. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3773.84s)]
*  This time, the question placed before the court and the circumstances which have brought [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3776.84s)]
*  it about are of more immediate and extreme importance. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3782.84s)]
*  Those circumstances include the General Assembly's alarm over the impunity with which Israel [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3788.84s)]
*  has continuously placated the provision of humanitarian, life-saving, and other desperately [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3794.84s)]
*  needed assistance by the UN and other concerned parties to the Palestinian population throughout [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3801.84s)]
*  the occupied Palestinian territory, most egregiously in the Gaza Strip, confirming the obligations [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3809.84s)]
*  of Israel to allow the United Nations, other international organizations, and third-party [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3817.84s)]
*  states to carry out activities in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3823.84s)]
*  Including providing such assistance could truly make the difference between life and [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3829.84s)]
*  death for many people. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3835.84s)]
*  Israel's hideous conduct, which piles illegality upon illegality, is well documented. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3838.84s)]
*  Its most ruthless application has been the siege conditions imposed over the Gaza Strip [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3847.84s)]
*  since October 2023. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3853.84s)]
*  As the entire world is painfully aware, diseases, lack of sanitation, clean water, food, shelter, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3857.84s)]
*  and medical care is endemic, while temporary respites have occasionally occurred. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3867.84s)]
*  Israel has reimbursed conditions of total blockade at will, just as it did in early [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3875.84s)]
*  March this year, completely halting the provision of food, water, medical supplies, temporary [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3881.84s)]
*  housing, fuel, and anything else to the starving, displaced, and exposed population of the Gaza [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3889.84s)]
*  Strip. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3898.84s)]
*  Nothing justifies such barbarity. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3899.84s)]
*  Israel's blockade of humanitarian assistance and simultaneous brutalization of the civilian [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3904.84s)]
*  population throughout bombardment can only be understood as two components of a single [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3911.84s)]
*  enterprise. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3917.84s)]
*  Namely, a means for bringing about the ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip, displacing or [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3918.84s)]
*  killing its Palestinian population to make room for Israel to settle and annex the territory. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3927.84s)]
*  Israel's failure to ensure and facilitate unhindered humanitarian assistance to the [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3934.84s)]
*  population of Gaza would surely be seen as an integral part of this crime against humanity, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3940.84s)]
*  if it were ever to come to pass. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3948.84s)]
*  And of course, withholding such humanitarian development assistance also plays a role in [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3952.84s)]
*  a larger Israeli undertaking, that is, to demolish the established right of the Palestinian [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3958.84s)]
*  people to self-determination by undermining their ability to survive and stand on their own. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3965.84s)]
*  The Court is aware of the appalling circumstances faced by the population of the Gaza Strip [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3974.84s)]
*  and their dire need for humanitarian assistance on a sustained basis. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3979.84s)]
*  The Court has issued provisional measures in South Africa versus Israel on three occasions, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3986.84s)]
*  ordering Israel to take all necessary and effective measures to ensure the provision [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3992.84s)]
*  of desperately needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinians throughout Gaza. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=3998.84s)]
*  Israel ignored those orders, as it has similar calls made by other UN bodies, international [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4005.84s)]
*  organizations and concerned states. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4013.84s)]
*  Instead, it has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis and turned the Gaza Strip into an unlivable [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4016.84s)]
*  pile of rubble, while killing thousands of innocent and vulnerable people. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4024.84s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4031.84s)]
*  On or around April 15th of this year, the Palestinian death toll in the Gaza Strip reached [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4035.84s)]
*  a grim figure of 51,000, some 15,000 of them children. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4042.84s)]
*  Over 116,000 people have been wounded. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4049.84s)]
*  These figures increase every day. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4054.84s)]
*  Even during the short periods of so-called ceasefire, it's not difficult to understand [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4057.84s)]
*  why, as the Israeli military has removed all restraints on killing innocents. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4063.84s)]
*  It has conducted over 40,000 airstrikes on the Tainist Strip. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4069.84s)]
*  Terrifyingly, it employs artificial intelligence to determine who to kill and who to spare. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4075.84s)]
*  It establishes kill zones where anyone crossing invisible boundaries, even women and children, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4084.84s)]
*  is shot on sight. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4093.84s)]
*  It bombards so-called safe zones, killing countless innocents, meanwhile sheltering [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4095.84s)]
*  in a flimsy tent. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4100.84s)]
*  It denies requests by international organizations to import equipment required to clear the [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4102.84s)]
*  estimated thousands of unexploded Israeli ordnance scattered across the Gaza Strip, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4110.84s)]
*  which have killed or maimed numerous innocent Palestinians. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4116.84s)]
*  Adding to these catastrophic conditions has been the systematic destruction of hospitals, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4122.84s)]
*  water infrastructure, agricultural land, bakeries, homes, and other messages of life [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4128.84s)]
*  throughout the territory, creating conditions of suffering, disease, and starvation. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4136.84s)]
*  The requests now before the court seeking to clarify the obligations of Israel to allow [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4143.84s)]
*  international organizations and states to provide humanitarian assistance and operate [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4149.84s)]
*  within the occupied Palestinian territory, including Gaza, must be seen in this context, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4155.84s)]
*  as it explains why the requests have such urgency and importance. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4162.84s)]
*  As shameful as Israel's conduct towards the Palestinian people is, the harm it caused [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4167.84s)]
*  them is not the only damaging consequences of that conduct, nor the only reason why the [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4175.84s)]
*  question before the court has such importance, another critical reason to establish the scope [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4182.84s)]
*  of the Israeli obligations encompassed by the General Assembly's request is to clarify [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4188.84s)]
*  the legal framework for evaluating Israel's actions against the UN and other international [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4194.84s)]
*  organizations and third states seeking to assist the Palestinians within the occupied [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4201.84s)]
*  Palestinian territory. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4207.84s)]
*  Israel's hostility towards the UN is too lengthy to summarize here. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4211.84s)]
*  Its attacks have been particularly aimed at UNRWA, which since 1949 has played an indispensable [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4216.84s)]
*  role in safeguarding the basic rights and living conditions of the Palestinian people [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4223.84s)]
*  who were displaced from their homeland, providing health care, education, food, and other [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4228.84s)]
*  assistance to some 5.1 million refugees. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4236.84s)]
*  As emphasized by the UN Secretary General, when it comes to providing humanitarian relief [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4240.84s)]
*  and assistance to the people of Gaza, there is no realistic alternative to UNRWA. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4246.84s)]
*  Israel's hostility against UNRWA began long before the current crisis. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4255.84s)]
*  However, since October 2023, its attacks have intensified dramatically. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4260.84s)]
*  Israeli forces have killed over 200 UNRWA employees, attacked and destroyed their premises, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4267.84s)]
*  brain-sacked their warehouses, and denied entry to UNRWA relief supplies. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4275.84s)]
*  Israeli police have stood by while UNRWA's premises in Jerusalem were attacked and burned [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4280.84s)]
*  by an Israeli mob. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4288.84s)]
*  Israel also ordered UNRWA to vacate its premises in occupied East Jerusalem, and has passed [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4290.84s)]
*  laws prohibiting Israeli authorities from having any contact with UNRWA and preventing [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4297.84s)]
*  UNRWA from operating within Israeli territory, which it illegally claims includes occupied [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4303.84s)]
*  East Jerusalem. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4311.84s)]
*  The executions Israel has given to justify its actions, claiming that UNRWA lacks neutrality, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4313.84s)]
*  promotes pious narratives, and is infiltrated by Hamas, have been addressed by the UN and [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4321.84s)]
*  discredited. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4328.84s)]
*  Moreover, an independent review led by the former French Foreign Minister found Israel's [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4329.84s)]
*  allegations to be unsubstantiated and lacking of any credible evidence. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4336.84s)]
*  The fabrications underlying Israel's actions against UNRWA and against the UN more generally [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4344.84s)]
*  cannot be seriously doubted. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4350.84s)]
*  What those actions establish, however, is the Court's opinion about Israel's obligations [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4353.84s)]
*  encompassed with the General Assembly's request is urgently required not just to prevent [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4359.84s)]
*  further harming the Palestinian people's right to receive humanitarian development [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4365.84s)]
*  support, but also to safeguard the legal foundation in which the UN and other entities conduct [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4369.84s)]
*  humanitarian activities. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4378.84s)]
*  Turning to the Court's jurisdiction, our views and the views of almost every other [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4383.84s)]
*  state participating in these proceedings are in agreement that, given the legal questions [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4389.84s)]
*  raised, the Court has jurisdiction to issue the requested advisory opinion, and that there [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4395.84s)]
*  are no compelling reasons for it not to do so. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4402.84s)]
*  On the contrary, given the inhumane conditions to which Israel has subjected to the Palestinian [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4407.84s)]
*  people most terrifyingly in the Gaza Strip, we respectfully submit that the Court is under [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4413.84s)]
*  a duty to issue its opinion so that Israel's obligation to ensure and facilitate the provision [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4421.84s)]
*  of humanitarian assistance by the United Nations, other international organizations, and third [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4427.84s)]
*  states are made clear. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4433.84s)]
*  Furthermore, the General Assembly's inquiry into Israel's obligation impacts matters [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4436.84s)]
*  of widespread importance, including the operations of the UN and other aid agencies, as well [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4441.84s)]
*  as Palestinian rights, a matter of universal concern since the adoption of Resolution 181 [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4448.84s)]
*  in the second session in 1947. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4455.84s)]
*  The requests also highlight urgent issues, including Israel's legislative ban on UNRWA, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4459.84s)]
*  military actions, impeding humanitarian aid, and threats to UN privileges and humanity. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4466.84s)]
*  A small minority of a group and states argue that the Court should refrain from issuing [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4473.84s)]
*  this advisory opinion because doing so would require it to undertake a significant factual [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4480.84s)]
*  investigation which is not appropriate for an advisory opinion, or that the question [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4486.84s)]
*  was formulated in a biased manner. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4492.84s)]
*  These arguments, which were rejected by the Court in the Wall and the Israeli policies [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4495.84s)]
*  and practices cases, would be similarly dismissed for the same reasons articulated in those [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4502.84s)]
*  decisions. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4508.84s)]
*  The same states argue that the Court should decline to give its opinion because it has [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4510.84s)]
*  already addressed the subject of the request in its previous advisory opinions related [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4517.84s)]
*  to the occupied Palestinian territory, or that rendering the occupied would prejudge [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4522.84s)]
*  the ongoing contentious proceedings in South Africa versus Israel. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4528.84s)]
*  These arguments have no merit. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4533.84s)]
*  The present request is self-evidently distinct from the prior requests, as the scope and [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4536.84s)]
*  nature of Israel's obligations to ensure and facilitate the provision of humanitarian [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4543.84s)]
*  assistance by the UN, other international organizations, and third states was not expressly [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4548.84s)]
*  addressed by the Court in either of those advisory opinions, leaving the Court views [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4555.84s)]
*  in that regard unknown. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4561.84s)]
*  As for the argument that these advisory proceedings would prejudge the outcome of the Dunecide [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4563.84s)]
*  case, that argument fails for obvious reasons. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4569.84s)]
*  As for the argument that these advisory proceedings would prejudge in South Africa versus Israel, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4576.84s)]
*  the Court is called upon to interpret and apply the Dunecide Convention and to determine [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4585.84s)]
*  whether Israel's conduct in Gaza engages its international responsibility under that [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4592.84s)]
*  Convention. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4597.84s)]
*  To a significant extent, the answer to that question is whether the requisite intent under [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4598.84s)]
*  Article 2 of the Convention can be attributed to Israel. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4606.84s)]
*  The answer to the questions raised in these proceedings, which are broadly focused on [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4610.84s)]
*  identifying the obligation of Israel to ensure and facilitate humanitarian and other assistance [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4616.84s)]
*  throughout the occupied Palestinian territory. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4622.84s)]
*  And do not ask the Court to determine Israel's responsibility under the Dunecide Convention [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4627.84s)]
*  and would in no way prejudge that narrow question. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4635.84s)]
*  Turning to the question before the Court, I will highlight only a few key points. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4641.84s)]
*  First, as an occupying power, Israel is bound by international humanitarian law, in particular [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4646.84s)]
*  the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the Fourth Geneva Convention. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4655.84s)]
*  Under those norms, and at the bare minimum, Israel must guarantee the basic needs of the [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4661.84s)]
*  population in the occupied Palestinian territory at all times, including the provision of food, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4668.84s)]
*  water, shelter and medical supplies. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4675.84s)]
*  It must allow medical personnel to carry out their duties and must not adopt measures [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4679.84s)]
*  amounting to collective management. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4685.84s)]
*  But Israel's obligations do not end there. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4688.84s)]
*  Pursuant to Article 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, if an occupying power is unwilling [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4692.84s)]
*  or unable to fulfill its duty to provide the whole or part of the population of the occupied [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4699.84s)]
*  territory with essential supplies and services, as is obviously the case in Gaza, it has an [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4705.84s)]
*  absolute duty to facilitate such provision by international organizations or third states. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4713.84s)]
*  These obligations are unconditional and are supplemented by Article 69 of additional [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4720.84s)]
*  Protocol 1. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4728.84s)]
*  These obligations are, in the case of Israel, complemented by the duty of raising undersecretary [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4729.84s)]
*  council resolutions not to abstract, attack or impede organizations and states from providing [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4737.84s)]
*  urgently needed humanitarian development assistance to the population in the occupied Palestinian [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4746.84s)]
*  territory. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4752.84s)]
*  As an occupying power, Israel's international human rights law obligations are also engaged. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4754.84s)]
*  Under these obligations, Israel must respect, protect and fulfill the fundamental human [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4761.84s)]
*  rights of the Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4769.84s)]
*  These include their right to life, to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4774.84s)]
*  health, to an adequate standard of living, to adequate food, clothing, housing, water [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4781.84s)]
*  and education. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4789.84s)]
*  The obstruction by Israel of efforts by international organizations, including the United Nations [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4791.84s)]
*  or by third states, to provide basic services and assistance to the Palestinian people and [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4798.84s)]
*  their occupation in order for them to enjoy such protected human rights entails a clear [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4805.84s)]
*  violation of Israel's human rights obligations. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4811.84s)]
*  As a UN member and as a party of the UN Convention on Privileges and Immunities, Israel has further [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4815.84s)]
*  obligations relevant to these advisory proceedings. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4824.84s)]
*  Under Article 2, Subsection 2 and 2, Subsection 5 of the UN Charter, Israel must cooperate [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4827.84s)]
*  in good faith with the United Nations giving it, quote, every assistance in any action [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4836.84s)]
*  taken in accordance with the Charter, end quote. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4844.84s)]
*  Israel's obligation to provide every assistance in good faith to the United Nations encompasses [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4848.84s)]
*  the principal UN organs as well as other UN subsidiary organs, including UNRWA. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4856.84s)]
*  As UNRWA's mandate is to provide humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people, Israel [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4863.84s)]
*  duty bound to give every assistance to UNRWA in good faith. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4869.84s)]
*  The attempt by certain states in these proceedings to limit Article 2, Subsection 5, as only [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4876.84s)]
*  applying to enforcement action by the Security Council pursuant to Chapter 7 of the Charter [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4881.84s)]
*  is incorrect, contrary to this Court's interpretation of that provision in the Liberation's advisory [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4887.84s)]
*  opinion. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4895.84s)]
*  Under Article 25 of the Charter, Israel has also agreed to accept and carry out the decisions [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4897.84s)]
*  of the Security Council. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4905.84s)]
*  Israel must therefore comply with the Security Council resolution demanding that it give [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4907.84s)]
*  unhindered access to those providing humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4914.84s)]
*  Israel also has a duty to guarantee that the UN enjoys the legal capacity necessary for [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4921.84s)]
*  exercise of its functions and fulfillment of its purposes. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4929.84s)]
*  This duty is enshrined in Article 104 of the Charter and Article 1, Section 1 of the Convention [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4934.84s)]
*  on Privileges and Immunities. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4942.84s)]
*  Moreover, Israel is under a duty to guarantee the United Nations and its officials the privileges [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4944.84s)]
*  and immunities necessary for the fulfillment of their functions. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4952.84s)]
*  The obligation is contained in Article 105, Subsection 1 of the Charter and was further [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4958.84s)]
*  developed in the Convention on Privileges and Immunities. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4964.84s)]
*  That Convention provides that the United Nations, as well as its officials, property, and assets, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4968.84s)]
*  are immune from every form of legal process. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4976.84s)]
*  Recently, Israel enacted laws that target UNRWA by revoking its privileges and immunities [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4982.84s)]
*  and allowing potential criminal proceedings against UNRWA. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4989.84s)]
*  Officials beat these duties. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4994.84s)]
*  Finally, the Convention states the undisputed principle that the premises of the United [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=4997.84s)]
*  Nations shall be inviolable. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5004.84s)]
*  This obligation has several implications. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5007.84s)]
*  First, Israeli authorities may not enter the premises of the United Nations or its [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5010.84s)]
*  organs without their consent. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5016.84s)]
*  Second, Israel has a positive duty to protect and safeguard those premises from external [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5019.84s)]
*  threats. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5027.84s)]
*  And third, Israel must not attack those premises. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5028.84s)]
*  Importantly, these obligations are not qualified and do not cease to apply in situations of [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5032.84s)]
*  armed conflict. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5039.84s)]
*  Thus, Israel's failure to guarantee the inviolability of UN premises can never be justified on grounds [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5040.84s)]
*  of military expediency or national security. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5049.84s)]
*  I now turn to Israel's obligation to respect the Palestinian people's established right [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5053.84s)]
*  to self-determination. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5058.84s)]
*  I use Coggen's norm, generating obligations ergo ominous. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5060.84s)]
*  If that obligation is to mean anything, it surely requires, at a minimum, that Israel [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5064.84s)]
*  allow the provision of humanitarian development assistance to the Palestinian people by those [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5072.84s)]
*  prepared to give it so as to strengthen their ability to achieve self-determination. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5078.84s)]
*  Israel's refusal to comply with that imperative while perpetrating unspeakable violence on [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5086.84s)]
*  the Palestinian people can only confirm the war's fears about its intentions. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5093.84s)]
*  The Court's voice, confirming the scope and nature of Israel's obligations to ensure [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5100.84s)]
*  and facilitate humanitarian development assistance to the Palestinian population, will serve [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5106.84s)]
*  as a powerful force in preventing those fears from becoming a reality. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5111.84s)]
*  In closing, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia wishes to emphasize that the Palestinian people's [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5119.84s)]
*  right to self-determination is at the core of the question before the Court. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5127.84s)]
*  The Kingdom takes this opportunity to reaffirm its unconditional commitment to the establishment [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5133.84s)]
*  of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state within 1967 borders with East Jerusalem [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5140.84s)]
*  as its capital. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5148.84s)]
*  This unwavering position is non-negotiable and is not subject to compromises. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5150.84s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court, thank you for your attention. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5156.84s)]
*  This concludes the statement of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5162.84s)]
*  I thank the representative of Saudi Arabia for his presentation. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5169.84s)]
*  Before I invite the next delegation to take the floor, the Court will observe a coffee break of 15 minutes. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5175.84s)]
*  The hearing is suspended. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5183.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=5205.84s)]

*  La Tour. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6271.84s)]
*  Please be seated. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6315.84s)]
*  The sitting is resumed. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6327.84s)]
*  I now invite the next delegation, the Belgian delegation, to speak and call for Mr. Antoine Missonne. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6330.84s)]
*  Mr. I beg you. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6342.84s)]
*  Mr. President, Honorable Member of the Court, it is a great honour for me to present before you, as an agent of the Kingdom of Belgium, in this procedure concerning the request for consultative opinion submitted to the Court by the United Nations General Assembly in its resolution on December 19, 2020. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6344.84s)]
*  As Belgium has already had the opportunity to underline it, I quote, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6373.84s)]
*  The respect for international law, including humanitarian and human rights, is an angular stone of peace and security. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6380.84s)]
*  The current conflict in Gaza has put international law at risk. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6394.84s)]
*  It is precisely at such occasions that it is essential to reaffirm without any doubt our support for international norms that ensure peaceful coexistence within the international community. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6403.84s)]
*  Regardless of the time it has taken, Belgium will examine certain elements discussed in its written presentation in light of arguments raised by other speakers in the procedure. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6422.84s)]
*  For other aspects of the question, Belgium respectfully refers the Court to the developments contained in its written presentation. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6436.84s)]
*  With your permission, I will first briefly address the question of the exercise of discretionary power in your court. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6445.84s)]
*  Secondly, I will dwell on the obligations of Israel as a member of the United Nations. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6456.84s)]
*  Professor Vajos Koutroulis will then address the obligations of Israel in relation to the supply of humanitarian aid. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6464.84s)]
*  Mr President, to respect international law, it is necessary to know the scope of these rules. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6476.84s)]
*  According to the constant jurisprudence of the Court, when it is called to make a consultation, it should not refuse to respond to the request, except if there are decisive reasons to do so. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6485.84s)]
*  However, no argument that could lead to the Court refusing to give a consultative opinion was invoked in the written presentations of the participants in this procedure. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6502.84s)]
*  In reality, the vast majority of arguments had already been invoked in front of the Court and rejected by them in the context of previous consultative procedures. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6513.84s)]
*  Moreover, if any of the arguments invoked is not a decisive reason for the exercise of discretionary power, it is clear that considering the same arguments cumulatively should not change this conclusion. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6526.84s)]
*  In reality, the present procedure will help the General Assembly to fulfill its role and its functions. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6545.84s)]
*  It is necessary because the two previous consultative opinions, made by your Court and yet in the same general situation, have not been implemented. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6554.84s)]
*  It is therefore difficult, to put it mildly, to see in this new procedure an abusing or abusing of the Court. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6566.84s)]
*  On the contrary, the Court is here to play its role, to say the right thing, so that all parties involved act accordingly. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6578.84s)]
*  Thus, Belgium invites the Court to recognize that there is no decisive reason that would justify not responding to the request for a consultative opinion from the General Assembly. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6591.84s)]
*  I now turn to the second part of my presentation, which deals with the obligations of Israel as a member of the United Nations. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6604.84s)]
*  As a member of the UN, every State assumes certain obligations to the organization, its organs and personnel, in virtue of the UN Charter. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6614.84s)]
*  In addition, other conventions, such as the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunity of the United Nations, take relevant, additional obligations applicable to Israel. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6628.84s)]
*  In this context, respecting international law implies cooperating with the UN and assisting it in its action by avoiding acting unilaterally. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6642.84s)]
*  First, Article 2, paragraph 5 of the Charter predicts that the UN Member States, I quote, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6654.84s)]
*  "...give it full assistance in any action taken by it, in accordance with the provisions of the current Charter." [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6662.84s)]
*  As the text of the proposal suggests, this obligation applies to any action undertaken by the UN, i.e. any action of any UN body. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6672.84s)]
*  It is therefore not limited to the decisions of the Security Council adopted in virtue of Chapter 7 of the Charter, [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6683.84s)]
*  and also covers the presence and activities of organs such as the Office of Rescue and Labor of the United Nations for the Refugees of Palestine in the Middle East, the UN. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6691.84s)]
*  Obviously, the deployment of the UN and its personnel on the territory of a State requires consent. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6703.84s)]
*  However, this concerns only the territory on which a State exerts its sovereignty. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6711.84s)]
*  As the Court confirmed in the Consultative Life of 19 July 2024, I quote, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6720.84s)]
*  "...Israel does not have the right to sovereignty over some parts of the occupied Palestinian territory and would not be able to exercise sovereign powers over its occupation." [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6727.84s)]
*  It is clear that Israel cannot subordinate to its consent the presence and activities of the UN, [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6739.84s)]
*  the UN agencies and UN personnel on the occupied Palestinian territory. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6751.84s)]
*  The obligation of cooperation and assistance to any action of the UN can thus be fully implemented in the UN activities, including the UN, in occupied Palestinian territory. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6758.84s)]
*  The measures taken unilaterally in the UN are based in particular on allegations relating to the violation of neutrality by members of its personnel. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6773.84s)]
*  These allegations are extremely serious and must be taken seriously. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6785.84s)]
*  The UN has not remained inactive in the face of these allegations, as other participants in the procedure. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6791.84s)]
*  Belgium underlines the investigations carried out by the Office of Internal Control Services, BSCI, [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6799.84s)]
*  which have led to the dismissal of persons against whom there were evidence indicating that they could have been involved in the attacks of October 7, 2023. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6806.84s)]
*  In addition, the UN has asked for an independent evaluation of mechanisms and procedures aimed at ensuring the respect of the principle of neutrality by the UN. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6818.84s)]
*  The report in this context attests, among other things, to the fact that the UN has examined all external allegations of lack of neutrality [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6832.84s)]
*  and has opened investigations in the case of Prima Facie, where there was evidence of misconduct. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6843.84s)]
*  In addition, the report indicates that Israel has not provided evidence in support of these allegations, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6851.84s)]
*  according to which a significant number of UN employees are members of terrorist organizations. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6857.84s)]
*  Thus, we are far from the image depicted by Israel within the Security Council, according to which I cite, [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6864.84s)]
*  The UN is an essential link of the Hamas terrorist device, which makes the UN itself a terrorist organization, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6873.84s)]
*  and that in Gaza, the Hamas is the UN and the UN is the Hamas. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6881.84s)]
*  Belgium rejects such a qualification and considers that the resolutions of the Security Council relating to terrorism are irrelevant to this advisory opinion. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6889.84s)]
*  In view of what precedes, unilateral actions taken against the UN and more particularly against the UNRWA are not only unjustified, [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6902.84s)]
*  but also in violation of the obligations assumed by the United Nations Member States. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6912.84s)]
*  The problems and grievances relating to UN actions must be resolved with the organization and not against it. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6919.84s)]
*  This concludes the second point of the Belgian oral exhibition. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6932.84s)]
*  Mr. President, I now ask you to give the floor to Professor Vajos Koutroullis to continue the presentation of the Belgian observations. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6936.84s)]
*  Thank you for your attention. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6945.84s)]
*  I thank Mr. Misson. I now give the floor to Professor Vajos Koutroullis. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6950.84s)]
*  Mr. President, Honorable Members of the Court, [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6960.84s)]
*  It is a great honour for me to present myself before you again on behalf of the Kingdom of Belgium. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6974.84s)]
*  I will continue the Belgian oral exhibition by looking at the obligations of Israel in relation to the supply of humanitarian aid. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6982.84s)]
*  With the resumption of hostilities, Israel blocked the entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza once again on March 2, 2025. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=6994.84s)]
*  The updates on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, published in April 2025 by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7006.84s)]
*  include the fact that the medicines are quickly running out, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7019.84s)]
*  the majority of the coordinated humanitarian aid movements and missions with the Israeli authorities have been refused, [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7028.84s)]
*  Gaza is facing a new risk of famine and malnutrition, [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7038.84s)]
*  access to water remains very limited and very unequal, [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7046.84s)]
*  and the conditions of suffocation remain alarming and are likely to aggravate the risks for public health. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7052.84s)]
*  It is therefore necessary and urgent to recall the obligations of Israel in relation to the supply of humanitarian aid [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7063.84s)]
*  and to clarify the content, keeping in mind that these obligations must be interpreted and applied with good faith. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7073.84s)]
*  First, I will dwell on the content of the obligations of international humanitarian law. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7085.84s)]
*  Second, I will dwell on the absence of reasons that justify the violation of these obligations. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7097.84s)]
*  Mr. President, the obligations of Israel in terms of providing humanitarian aid [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7107.84s)]
*  come not only from international humanitarian law, but also from international human rights, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7115.84s)]
*  human rights, the right to self-determination, [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7126.84s)]
*  relevant resolutions of the United Nations [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7130.84s)]
*  and relevant conservative measures ordered by the Court in the case against South Africa. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7135.84s)]
*  This legal framework imposes on the occupying power obligations both positive and negative. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7142.84s)]
*  In early April 2025, the number of human rights workers killed since October 2023 exceeded [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7152.84s)]
*  400. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7165.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have no choice but to remind ourselves that it is forbidden to attack [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7166.12s)]
*  the human rights of the people of the occupied territory, including all the measures of [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7206.84s)]
*  these means. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7218.6s)]
*  When we deprive the civil population of this obligation, Article 59 of the same Convention [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7219.6s)]
*  provides that the occupying power will accept the actions of the people and facilitate it [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7235.32s)]
*  in all the measures of these means. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7248.08s)]
*  The terms insufficiently provided must be interpreted with good faith in light of the [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7251.48s)]
*  other rules of applicable international law, including those of the international law of [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7263.5199999999995s)]
*  human rights. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7270.24s)]
*  For example, in virtue of Article 43 of the 1907 Act, the occupying power has the general [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7271.24s)]
*  obligation to administer the occupied territories, to ensure, I quote, the order and public life. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7283.88s)]
*  In the articles 11 and 12 of the International Pact on Social and Cultural Economic Rights, [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7293.68s)]
*  it is announced that it has the right to water and the right to a sufficient level of life [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7303.4400000000005s)]
*  for each person and their family, including sufficient food, clothing and housing. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7311.200000000001s)]
*  The Committee on Social and Cultural Economic Rights explains that the right to sufficient [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7320.92s)]
*  food, as stated in Article 11 of the Pact, I quote, must not be interpreted in the narrow [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7328.92s)]
*  or restrictive way, from the right to a minimum ration of calories, proteins or other specific [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7341.92s)]
*  nutrients. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7349.92s)]
*  The same Committee states that, I quote again, the notion of adequate water supply must be [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7350.92s)]
*  interpreted in a way compatible with human dignity, and not in a narrow sense, without [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7365.92s)]
*  fully referring to volume criteria. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7374.92s)]
*  It comes from what precedes that the occupying power does not have only an obligation to [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7377.92s)]
*  maintain the civilian population alive. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7389.92s)]
*  After all, in occupied territories, the occupier must ensure the order and public life, and [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7392.92s)]
*  not simply the life of the civilians. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7399.92s)]
*  Thus, for the civilian population to be considered insufficiently provided, it must not be [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7403.92s)]
*  at the mercy of famine or even its threatened survival. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7413.92s)]
*  In this case, there is no doubt that the civilian population in the Gaza Strip is sufficiently [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7417.92s)]
*  provided. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7428.92s)]
*  Therefore, Israel must accept and facilitate the actions of its courts, international organizations, [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7429.92s)]
*  and state-owned enterprises. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7440.92s)]
*  After this remark on the content of the obligations of the occupying power in humanitarian rights, [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7441.92s)]
*  I will focus on the absence of reasons to justify the violation of these obligations. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7452.92s)]
*  This is the last point raised by Belgium. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7458.92s)]
*  Mr. President, respecting the obligations related to the supply of humanitarian milk and [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7465.92s)]
*  applying them reasonably implies not seeking to be fined by invoking unjustified international [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7475.92s)]
*  rights. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7486.92s)]
*  In this case, these are military and security landings that are put forward to justify [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7487.92s)]
*  behaviors that do not comply with the obligations of humanitarian international rights. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7496.92s)]
*  In connection with these justifications, Belgium can insist on three points. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7501.92s)]
*  First, as military and security landings refer to the legitimacy of the use of force, Belgium [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7510.92s)]
*  reminds us that such considerations cannot affect the application of the rules of humanitarian [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7519.92s)]
*  rights or the manner in which the military and security landings are used. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7527.92s)]
*  This is what the principle of equality of the belligerents, the cardinal principle of [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7535.92s)]
*  humanitarian rights, founded, among other things, on the first common article of the [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7542.92s)]
*  Geneva Convention. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7549.92s)]
*  Second, as military and security landings refer to the legitimacy of the use of force, Belgium [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7550.92s)]
*  reminds us that such considerations cannot affect the application of the rules of humanitarian [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7558.92s)]
*  rights or the manner in which the military and security landings are used. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7565.92s)]
*  Third, as military and security landings refer to the legitimacy of the use of force, Belgium [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7570.92s)]
*  reminds us that such considerations cannot affect the application of the rules of humanitarian [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7577.92s)]
*  rights or the manner in which the military and security landings are used. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7585.92s)]
*  Fourth, as military and security landings refer to the legitimacy of the use of force, Belgium [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7590.92s)]
*  reminds us that such considerations cannot affect the application of the rules of humanitarian [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7595.92s)]
*  rights or the manner in which the military and security landings are used. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7602.92s)]
*  The article provides that the occupier will take all the measures that depend on him in [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7608.92s)]
*  order to restore and ensure, as much as possible, the order and the public life. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7616.92s)]
*  This text contains no explicit reference to military landings. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7625.92s)]
*  On the contrary, the accent is resolutely placed on the obligation of the occupier to take [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7632.92s)]
*  all measures that depend on him in order to restore and ensure, as much as possible, the [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7639.92s)]
*  order and the public life. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7644.92s)]
*  The Article 43 of the Treaty of La Haye cannot serve as a foundation for a general excuse [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7647.92s)]
*  linked to military needs. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7654.92s)]
*  Even less to justify violations of obligations from another convention, the Fourth Convention [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7656.92s)]
*  of Geneva, obligations that are not subordinated to the Article 43 of the Treaty of La Haye. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7663.92s)]
*  Thirdly, the military and security landings are not used as a foundation for a general [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7671.92s)]
*  excuse. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7682.92s)]
*  Thirdly, the military and security landings are not mislead by humanitarian rights. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7683.92s)]
*  On the contrary, they are taken into account in all the rules of this right. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7694.92s)]
*  As a result, military landings can only be invoked as the relevant provisions are planned. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7702.92s)]
*  If a rule declares an unconditional obligation, the occupying power will not be able to invoke [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7713.92s)]
*  these military landings in order to be not so conformed. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7724.92s)]
*  If the formulation of a disposition allows the occupation of the occupying power, the invocation [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7729.92s)]
*  will not be problematic as long as it remains within the limits provided by the relevant [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7737.92s)]
*  rule. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7744.92s)]
*  This interpretation must always be done with good faith. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7745.92s)]
*  If, for example, the implementation of procedures or conditions of access to this constraint [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7752.92s)]
*  that make the supply of humanitarian aid impossible or impracticable, is equivalent to the refusal [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7763.92s)]
*  of access to humanitarian aid and cannot be justified by military considerations. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7775.92s)]
*  Several speakers have shown themselves sensitive to the military and security landings of Israel. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7785.92s)]
*  Throughout his presentation, Belgium has allowed itself to insist on the respect of international [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7796.92s)]
*  law to emphasize an idea as simple as essential. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7803.92s)]
*  Military landings and state security must be exercised in accordance with international law, [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7810.92s)]
*  not in spite of international law. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7820.92s)]
*  Mr. President, Honorable Members of the Court, this concludes the oral presentation of the [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7826.92s)]
*  Regum of Belgium. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7832.92s)]
*  Thank you for your kind attention. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7833.92s)]
*  Thank you, representatives of Belgium, for your presentation. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7838.92s)]
*  I now invite the Delegation of Colombia to make its oral statement, and I call His Excellency [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7844.92s)]
*  Mauricio Ramillo to the podium. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7852.92s)]
*  You have the floor, sir. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7857.92s)]
*  Mr. President, Madam Vice President, Distinguished Members of the Court, it is an honor to appear [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7871.92s)]
*  before you today on behalf of the Republic of Colombia. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7877.92s)]
*  Colombia stands before this Court to express its grave concern over the dire humanitarian [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7882.92s)]
*  situation in the occupied Palestinian territory, a situation caused by Israel and further exacerbated [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7888.92s)]
*  by its own plans and measures that interfere with the United Nations' presence and operations [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7896.92s)]
*  in the field. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7903.92s)]
*  This concern, broadly shared by the international community, has led the General Assembly to [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7904.92s)]
*  seek urgent guidance from the Court through these expediting proceedings. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7910.92s)]
*  In line with its consistent commitment to full realization of the inalienable right [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7916.92s)]
*  of the Palestinian people to self-determination, Colombia actively supported and promptly [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7923.92s)]
*  sponsored Resolution No. 79232 of 19 December 2024. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7931.92s)]
*  Our presence here is also a reaffirmation of Colombia's longstanding tradition of respect [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7941.92s)]
*  for international law. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7948.92s)]
*  Furthermore, Colombia is before you today in compliance with the duty incumbent upon [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7950.92s)]
*  all States, as the Court has reaffirmed, to ensure that any impediment to the exercise [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7957.92s)]
*  of the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination resulting from the illegal [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7966.92s)]
*  presence of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory is brought to an end. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7972.92s)]
*  Colombia thus categorically rejects any recourse to violence or unilateral act that leads to [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7980.92s)]
*  a higher level of confrontation and expresses its particular alarm for the deteriorating [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7989.92s)]
*  humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, where after months of continuing siege and [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=7995.92s)]
*  ongoing attacks on civilians and infrastructure hostilities have intensified even as these [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8003.92s)]
*  proceedings are conducted. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8010.92s)]
*  Colombia contends that Israel has engaged in escalating conducts which have put the [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8013.92s)]
*  Palestinian population in an impossible position. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8019.92s)]
*  On top of a dire humanitarian crisis that Israel itself has created, Israel has now [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8023.92s)]
*  placed serious impediments for international organizations as well as third states to [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8030.92s)]
*  fulfill their respective mandates and obligations under international law. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8036.92s)]
*  Israel has made the Palestinian population subject exclusively to its power and has [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8042.92s)]
*  impeded the work of relief agencies which have been the only protection for the starving [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8048.92s)]
*  population, a population already facing the threat of constant war and destruction and [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8054.92s)]
*  depriving it of the lone source of food, health, or education. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8061.92s)]
*  Colombia submits that such conduct is inconsistent with Israel's status as occupying power, [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8067.92s)]
*  unlawful as the occupying itself is, and constitutes a breach of its obligation as [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8075.92s)]
*  member of the United Nations and under international humanitarian and human rights law. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8081.92s)]
*  Against this background, I shall first refer to Colombia's views on the jurisdiction and [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8088.92s)]
*  discretion of the court. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8094.92s)]
*  Thereafter, I will refer to Israel's obligation arising both from its status as a member of [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8097.92s)]
*  the United Nations and under international humanitarian law as well as the legal consequences [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8103.92s)]
*  entailed from its international wrongful acts. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8109.92s)]
*  Finally, I will conclude this statement by setting out a series of final observations. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8113.92s)]
*  Mr. President, a handful of states have urged the court to exercise its discretion to refrain [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8121.92s)]
*  from issuing the requested opinion, contending that it might affect or prejudge determinations [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8129.92s)]
*  to be made in the contentious proceedings initiated by South Africa against Israel. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8137.92s)]
*  Colombia firmly rejects this reasoning. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8143.92s)]
*  Advisory proceedings should never be used to bring to the court matters that are essentially [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8146.92s)]
*  bilateral. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8152.92s)]
*  Nonetheless, in the present proceedings, the question refers to a wide range of issues [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8154.92s)]
*  that are of general concern. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8159.92s)]
*  This is confirmed by the fact that an overwhelming number of member states decided it was fundamental [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8162.92s)]
*  for the General Assembly to receive guidance on the question put to the court. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8169.92s)]
*  The General Assembly, moreover, was empathic in expressing the view that developments on the [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8175.92s)]
*  ground, particularly those which could prevent UNRWA and other agencies as well as third [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8181.92s)]
*  states from continuing its essential work in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8189.92s)]
*  Demand consideration and guidance from the court on a priority basis and with the utmost [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8195.92s)]
*  urgency. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8201.92s)]
*  The General Assembly is therefore in acumen of this guidance. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8203.92s)]
*  Colombia will now focus on three topics which, in our review, could serve as guidance to the [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8208.92s)]
*  court in addressing the question posed by the General Assembly. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8214.92s)]
*  First, the centrality of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and Israel's [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8218.92s)]
*  corresponding obligation to bring the occupation to an end. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8226.92s)]
*  Second, Israel's responsibilities arising from its status as a member state of the United [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8230.92s)]
*  Nations and under international humanitarian law. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8236.92s)]
*  Finally, the legal consequences entailed by Israel's international wrongful acts. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8241.92s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished members of the court, General Assembly Resolution 79-232 takes [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8247.92s)]
*  at its point of departure and point of arrival the inalienable right of all peoples to [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8257.92s)]
*  self-determination. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8264.92s)]
*  Hence, recognition is it as one of the essential principles guiding the obligations under the [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8265.92s)]
*  relevant rules of international law applicable that shall also guide the activities of Israel [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8272.92s)]
*  as the occupying power in the occupied Palestinian territory with regard to the right of the [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8278.92s)]
*  Palestinian people. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8284.92s)]
*  In this vein, Colombia recalls that, as mentioned by the court in the legal consequences [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8286.92s)]
*  advisory opinion, Israel as the occupying power has the obligation not to impede the [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8292.92s)]
*  Palestinian people from exercising its right to self-determination, including its right [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8299.92s)]
*  to an independent and sovereign state over the entirety of the occupied Palestinian territory. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8305.92s)]
*  The centrality of the right to self-determination as, I quote, one of the essential principles of [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8313.92s)]
*  contemporary international law is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and is [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8320.92s)]
*  recognized as a rule of customary international law vested with the status of Yuscohen's norm. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8326.92s)]
*  This court has further recognized that the obligation to respect the right to self-determination [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8334.92s)]
*  is an erga omnes obligation, thus implying that all states have a legal interest in ensuring [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8340.92s)]
*  its protection. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8348.92s)]
*  It follows that a paramount and corresponding obligation incumbent upon Israel, given its [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8350.92s)]
*  prolonged and unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, is to bring its occupation [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8356.92s)]
*  to an end as rapidly as possible, as consistently pointed out by relevant United Nations [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8362.92s)]
*  organs. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8368.92s)]
*  With this framework in mind, we turn now to Colombia's second point, namely that of Israel's [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8369.92s)]
*  responsibilities arising from its status as a member state of the United Nations and [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8375.92s)]
*  under international humanitarian law, with respect to the presence and operations of [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8380.92s)]
*  the United Nations, its agencies, other organizations, and even third states in and concerning the [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8384.92s)]
*  occupied Palestinian territory. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8390.92s)]
*  The Republic of Colombia is of the view that Israel, as a member of the United States, [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8393.92s)]
*  is subject to two core obligations. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8398.92s)]
*  First, to fulfill in good faith the obligation it has undertaken under and in accordance [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8401.92s)]
*  with the Charter of the United Nations, and second, to assist the United Nations in any [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8406.92s)]
*  action it takes pursuant to the Charter. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8413.92s)]
*  With regard to the first obligation, Article 2, paragraph 2 of the Charter, require Israel [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8416.92s)]
*  to fulfill in good faith the obligations it accepted when it ratified this treaty, which [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8422.92s)]
*  in any event prevailed over any other obligation, according to Article 103. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8427.92s)]
*  In line with this general obligation, Section 34 of the General Convention on the Privileges [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8433.92s)]
*  and Immunities of the United Nations of 1949 provides that, I quote, when an instrument [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8439.92s)]
*  of accession is deposited on behalf of any member, the member will be in a position under [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8446.92s)]
*  its own law to give effect to the terms of this convention. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8452.92s)]
*  Therefore, Israel, as a state party to this convention since 1949, is bound by the obligations [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8456.92s)]
*  contained during and must fulfill them in good faith with regard to the United Nations, [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8464.92s)]
*  including UNRWA, an agency of the organization. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8471.92s)]
*  Regarding the second obligation, Article 2, paragraph 5 of the Charter, which refers to [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8474.92s)]
*  the obligation of assistance owed to the organization by all member states, it constitutes [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8479.92s)]
*  an essential element to allow the United Nations to fulfill its purposes and principles. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8485.92s)]
*  The terminology employed in this provision is unambiguous and it establishes a broad obligation [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8492.92s)]
*  encompassing every assistance in any action undertaken by the United Nations. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8499.92s)]
*  The above extends to agencies and bodies of the organization established under Article 22 [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8506.92s)]
*  of the Charter, such as UNRWA, whose mandate is to implement resolutions issued by the [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8513.92s)]
*  General Assembly, thus constituting actions taken by the United Nations in accordance [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8519.92s)]
*  with the Charter. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8526.92s)]
*  Therefore, Colombia considers that as a member of the United Nations, Israel is required [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8528.92s)]
*  to give UNRWA every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the Charter, including [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8533.92s)]
*  by fulfilling its obligations under the General Convention and the exchange of letters in [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8539.92s)]
*  relations with UNRWA. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8546.92s)]
*  Colombia shares the view of several states which in their written statements expressed [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8549.92s)]
*  that Israel must comply with the obligation encompassed in the condition of its admission [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8555.92s)]
*  to membership in the United Nations, as contained in General Assembly Resolution 273 of 1949. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8560.92s)]
*  In this regard, to honor the commitment undertaken upon its admission to the United Nations, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8569.92s)]
*  the State of Israel is obliged to fully and faithfully comply with the provisions of the Charter [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8576.92s)]
*  in relation to the presence and activities of the United Nations. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8583.92s)]
*  This entails inter alia bring an end to the occupation, cease all violations of the Palestinian [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8588.92s)]
*  people's right to self-determination, uphold the privileges and immunities of United Nations [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8595.92s)]
*  property and personnel, refrain from any interference with the delivery of humanitarian assistance, [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8600.92s)]
*  whether rendered by UNRWA or other agencies or organizations or third states, and more broadly, [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8607.92s)]
*  conduct itself as a peace-loving state in accordance with the principles of international law [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8614.92s)]
*  and particularly of international humanitarian law as it will be further elaborated below. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8620.92s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the status of Israel as occupying power over the entire Palestinian [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8627.92s)]
*  territory has been confirmed by the Court. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8636.92s)]
*  It has been in effect in this territory since at least 1967. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8640.92s)]
*  As a consequence, Israel has been keen to respect international humanitarian law in force, [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8648.92s)]
*  including the 4th Geneva Convention, the Regulation of the Hague of 1907 [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8655.92s)]
*  and the relevant international humanitarian law of natural custom. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8662.92s)]
*  The current humanitarian situation makes Israel even more imperial and respected [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8668.92s)]
*  and I would like to address the specific obligations that Israel must observe in terms of [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8674.92s)]
*  its occupying power in accordance with international humanitarian law, [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8681.92s)]
*  in particular in terms of the UN's presence and activities in the occupied Palestinian territories. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8690.92s)]
*  First, as she indicated in her exposition, the Columbia states that the humanitarian aid [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8699.92s)]
*  and the basic services to the civil population of the occupied Palestinian territory [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8706.92s)]
*  are indispensable to guarantee its protection and subsistence. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8711.92s)]
*  As an occupying power, Israel is responsible for the administration of this territory [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8716.92s)]
*  and therefore has the obligation to act in the interests of the civil population that resides there. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8722.92s)]
*  As a consequence, Israel is linked by several rules that exist in humanitarian aid in the context of occupation. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8728.92s)]
*  First, in the context of an international armed conflict, Article 23 of the 4th Geneva Convention [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8735.92s)]
*  imposes to Israel the obligation to grant the passage of humanitarian aid to civilians. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8743.92s)]
*  Second, in the context of international customary law, Israel as an occupying power [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8751.92s)]
*  must ensure that all the necessary supplies for the survival of the civil population are available. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8759.92s)]
*  In addition, by virtue of Article 59 of the 4th Geneva Convention, [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8768.92s)]
*  Israel is entitled to accept in the name of the civil population the actions of aid that could be undertaken [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8773.92s)]
*  either by third parties or by humanitarian organizations, [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8780.92s)]
*  when the needs of the population are not satisfied. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8784.92s)]
*  The Columbia notes that throughout this procedure, the states have highlighted that Israel's inability [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8789.92s)]
*  to respond to the needs of the civil population constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8795.92s)]
*  Likewise, the Columbia supports that Israel cannot simply succumb to its obligation [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8802.92s)]
*  to allow the free passage of humanitarian aid based on its own presumptions. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8808.92s)]
*  To be aware of these obligations, Israel must provide concrete evidence [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8813.92s)]
*  that the needs of the civil population are sufficiently satisfied. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8819.92s)]
*  The Columbia considers that this is not the case. Israel cannot hide the indispensable resources of UNRWA. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8824.92s)]
*  As a result, the vast majority of participants in this procedure showed that no other organization [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8831.92s)]
*  has the infrastructure, the capacity and experience necessary to acquire specific mandates entrusted to UNRWA. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8838.92s)]
*  The Columbia therefore considers that Israel lacks its obligation, [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8848.92s)]
*  by virtue of international humanitarian law, to refrain from any action [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8852.92s)]
*  by hindering the supply of basic services and humanitarian aid to the Palestinian population. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8856.92s)]
*  Mr. President, Mrs. Chairwoman of the Court, Israel is inclined to refrain from attacking, [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8863.92s)]
*  destroying, taking or making the essential goods of the survival of the civil population unusable. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8869.92s)]
*  The Columbia supports that Israel, as an occupying power, must refrain from targeting medical facilities, [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8876.92s)]
*  medical staff, emergency vehicles, and must cease to use these medical facilities [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8883.92s)]
*  at military expense, according to international humanitarian law in use. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8889.92s)]
*  It must also guarantee that the wounded have quick access to medical staff and ambulances, [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8894.92s)]
*  and that they are not exposed to the [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8899.92s)]
*  excessive concern of the occupying power and security. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8904.54s)]
*  The international occupation regime has established a delicate balance between humanitarian aid and its concerns, [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8914.92s)]
*  namely the control rights stated in articles 23 and 59 and 61 of the Geneva Convention. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8921.92s)]
*  These provisions could not be interpreted as authorizing excessive restrictions [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8928.92s)]
*  or generalized based on security motives. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8934.92s)]
*  Those of imperial military needs, with a specific geographical problem, [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8938.92s)]
*  can limit humanitarian invoices to a reasonable level. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8944.92s)]
*  As a result, Israel is not entitled to invoke security concerns [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8948.92s)]
*  as a general limit to the present and future activities of third parties [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8953.92s)]
*  that provide urgent and vital aid to the civil population. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8958.92s)]
*  In the absence of serious and credible reasons, [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8962.92s)]
*  the states can also legally prevent or interrupt humanitarian aid [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8965.92s)]
*  when the fundamental needs of the civil population are not satisfied. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8970.92s)]
*  If conditions require certain measures to respond to the concern of the occupying power in terms of security, [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8974.92s)]
*  they must be treated in accordance with international law and not in the case of national realization. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8982.92s)]
*  As a result of these restrictions justified at the entry of humanitarian aid, [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8989.92s)]
*  Colombia considers that Israel is impotent in accessing goods and supplies to Gaza [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8993.92s)]
*  by flagrantly violating the prohibition of famine as a method of war, [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=8999.92s)]
*  in accordance with the first paragraph of article 54 of the first additional protocol and article 14 of the second additional protocol. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9003.92s)]
*  Colombia believes that it is urgent to ensure respect for this obligation, [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9011.92s)]
*  given that the population of the Gaza Strip is faced with a high and high-risk food insecurity and famine. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9015.92s)]
*  This urgency was recalled in the order of conservative measures by the Court on January 26, 2024 [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9022.92s)]
*  in the South African affair of Israel on January 26, 2024, in which it asked Israel to take, I quote, [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9029.92s)]
*  all the measures in their power to prevent the commission of all the relevant acts of article 2 of the Convention on Genocide of 1948. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9037.92s)]
*  Mr. President, in accordance with the UN principles, [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9047.92s)]
*  this has always implemented an essential mandate in the occupied Palestinian territories. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9051.92s)]
*  Among them, the constant funding of humanitarian aid vital to the Palestinian population, [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9057.92s)]
*  and the refusal of registration by UNRWA. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9063.92s)]
*  Colombia shares the view expressed in several written exposés, [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9067.92s)]
*  in which the conditions and gaps that led the UNRWA to create UNRWA are still present today [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9072.92s)]
*  and have not only deteriorated over the past few years, [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9080.92s)]
*  making its work even more necessary and irreplaceable at the time of its creation. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9083.92s)]
*  In these preoccupating contexts, Colombia recalls that the international law does not apply in the gaps, [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9088.92s)]
*  but in relation to the facts and contexts of a larger legal framework, [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9096.92s)]
*  of which it constitutes only a party. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9101.92s)]
*  Consequently, as a result of the current framework of the facts and laws, [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9104.92s)]
*  we feel that by limiting activities and operations of UNRWA, [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9108.92s)]
*  Israel as an occupying power would deprive the civil population of the occupied Palestinian territories [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9112.92s)]
*  of supplies and urgent needs, which are essential to its survival. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9120.92s)]
*  The State of Israel therefore lacks openly the obligations that accompany it [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9125.92s)]
*  by virtue of the humanitarian international law, [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9130.92s)]
*  in the sense of the exact and omissions that interfere or hinder the presence and operations [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9133.92s)]
*  of the UNRWA in the occupied Palestinian territories and in relation to it. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9138.92s)]
*  This behavior implies its international responsibility, which I will now address. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9144.92s)]
*  Mr. President, the Court has a well-established tradition of addressing the consequences of the facts [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9150.92s)]
*  that are revealed in its consultative opinions. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9156.92s)]
*  For example, in the consultative opinions under the wall of 2004, under legal consequences, [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9159.92s)]
*  the Court provided orientations on the legal consequences of violation of international law, [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9165.92s)]
*  presiding over both the responsibility of the state and the obligations of its state. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9170.92s)]
*  In this regard, the Court has already considered that Israel's illegal presence [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9176.92s)]
*  constitutes an internationally illicit fact, continuing thus to its international responsibility. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9181.92s)]
*  In light of this, the Court invites the President of Colombia to complete [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9188.92s)]
*  its orientations on the legal consequences of Israel's violation of its obligations [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9193.92s)]
*  and to address the following. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9199.92s)]
*  First, as reflected in Article 30 of the CDI article project on state responsibility, [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9203.92s)]
*  Israel has the obligation to stop any illegal act against the United Nations, [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9211.92s)]
*  international organizations and the world state in relation to their presence and activities [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9216.92s)]
*  in the occupied Palestinian territories and in relation to it. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9222.92s)]
*  More precisely, Israel is obliged to cancel all measures that hinder the supply of basic services, [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9226.92s)]
*  humanitarian aid and aid to the development of the Palestinian people, [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9233.92s)]
*  including the legislation it adopted in October 2024, aimed at restoring the rule of law. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9238.92s)]
*  Second, as reported in Article 30B of the CDI article project, Israel has the obligation to [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9245.92s)]
*  provide the appropriate guarantees of our repetitions, in regards to the facts that have founded [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9253.92s)]
*  this consultation request of the General Assembly. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9262.92s)]
*  Third, in regards to the repair of damages caused, although certain actions of occupying power [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9265.92s)]
*  and an irreversible damage strain, certain circumstances can still be corrected and [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9272.92s)]
*  restored to their previous state. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9278.92s)]
*  And, when this is possible, all efforts must be made to obtain the restitution. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9280.92s)]
*  However, if this is not feasible, a denunciation is justified for the prejudices inflicted [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9285.92s)]
*  on the protested population. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9292.92s)]
*  Mr. President, Madam and Mr. Speaker, and even the Court, to conclude, I respectfully [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9296.92s)]
*  submit in the name of Colombia the following considerations. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9301.92s)]
*  Israel, as an occupying power and member state of the UN, as well as as a member of the [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9304.92s)]
*  Catian Convention of Geneva and the Convention on Genocide, in addition to its obligations [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9310.92s)]
*  of the international humanitarian aid, remains bound by its obligations and responsibilities [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9314.92s)]
*  in the Palestinian occupied territories until it is put to an end the Israeli presence [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9319.92s)]
*  as quickly as possible. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9326.92s)]
*  As an occupying power of Israel, it is legally required that humanitarian aid operations [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9328.92s)]
*  be carried out without imposing justified or arbitrary conditions, which directly contradict [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9335.92s)]
*  the fundamental principles and obligations consecrated by the international humanitarian [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9341.92s)]
*  aid, in particular those that compromise the occupying power during the occupation in [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9346.92s)]
*  the best interests of all the protected persons who are placed under its effective control. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9351.92s)]
*  Colombia also considers that by arbitrarily refusing to give its consent to the UN to [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9357.92s)]
*  pursue these operations and to intervene in the work of other international organizations [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9362.92s)]
*  in the Palestinian occupied territories, Israel condemns the population of Gaza to an [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9368.92s)]
*  aggravation of the humanitarian crisis. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9374.92s)]
*  Insofar as it is generally admitted that such a consent must not be arbitrarily refused [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9377.92s)]
*  in circumstances such as those to which Palestinian refugees are confronted, such a refusal [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9382.92s)]
*  can only constitute a violation of Israel of its obligations in virtue of international law [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9388.92s)]
*  in terms of the treatment of the civilian population in question. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9393.92s)]
*  Colombia values as a virtue the right of state responsibility in the measure that it is [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9398.92s)]
*  a continued violation of its international obligations, subject to the previous request [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9403.92s)]
*  of the General Assembly. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9408.92s)]
*  Israel is keen to take all the relevant measures to ensure the cessation, non-repetition [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9410.92s)]
*  and reparation of these violations. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9417.92s)]
*  Finally, Colombia is convinced that, as the Court recalled two decades ago, the United [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9419.92s)]
*  Nations Organization has, I quote, a permanent responsibility to assume what concerns [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9426.92s)]
*  the question of Palestine until it is resolved on all aspects in a satisfactory manner [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9432.92s)]
*  and in respect of international legality. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9437.92s)]
*  Finally, the Court will act as the main judiciary authority of the United Nations. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9440.92s)]
*  Mr. President, Madam Chair, Members of the Court, I thank you for your attention. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9448.92s)]
*  This concludes the intervention of the Republic of Colombia. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9452.92s)]
*  I thank the representative of Colombia for his presentation. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9455.92s)]
*  This concludes this morning's sitting. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9464.92s)]
*  The oral proceedings will resume this afternoon at 3 p.m. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9467.92s)]
*  in order for Bolivia, Brazil, Chile and Spain to be heard on the questions submitted to the Court. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9472.92s)]
*  The sitting is closed. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9480.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9485.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9515.92s)]
*  ... as intransgressible principles. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9534.92s)]
*  These include absolute prohibitions on their international humanitarian law against collective [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9537.92s)]
*  punishment, deliberate starvation, attacks on objects indispensable to survival and respect [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9542.92s)]
*  for non-derogable human rights. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9548.92s)]
*  Widespread denial of essential aid amounts to a breach of these fundamental rules. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9550.92s)]
*  Second, even where international humanitarian law permits security exceptions, these exceptions [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9556.92s)]
*  are narrowly defined and strictly conditioned. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9562.92s)]
*  The obligation under Article 59 of the Four Geneva Convention to agree to and facilitate relief [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9566.92s)]
*  contains no explicit security exception, allowing refusal or systematic obstruction of relief schemes [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9572.92s)]
*  undertaken by states or impartial organizations. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9580.92s)]
*  In any event, its requirements relating to population under occupation are distinct from the limited [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9584.92s)]
*  ability of a state to control access to third-party aid within its territory. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9591.92s)]
*  Third, Israel's security concerns cannot displace the specific and generally absolute nature of the [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9598.92s)]
*  privileges and immunities of the UN. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9606.92s)]
*  UNDRA, as a UN organ, benefits from these protections under the Charter and the General Convention. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9608.92s)]
*  Article 105 of the Charter obliges all members to grant the organization and its officials the privileges [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9615.92s)]
*  and immunities necessary for the fulfillment of its purposes and necessary for the independent [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9622.92s)]
*  exercise of their functions. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9628.92s)]
*  The General Convention implements this Charter duty without replacing it or superseding it. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9631.92s)]
*  These protections cannot be overridden by any security exceptions stemming from international [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9638.92s)]
*  humanitarian law. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9644.92s)]
*  Specifically, the inviolability of UN premises under Article 2, Section 3 of the General Convention [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9646.92s)]
*  is absolute. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9652.92s)]
*  It admits no exception, whether because of alleged misuse or security concerns asserted unilaterally [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9654.92s)]
*  by the occupying power or any other basis. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9662.92s)]
*  As to the functional immunities of UN personnel, Israel cannot unilaterally decide whether specific [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9667.92s)]
*  conduct falls outside of the official function. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9674.92s)]
*  That determination lies within the Secretary General or his delegate, UNDRA's Commissioner General. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9678.92s)]
*  And concerns about individuals must be addressed through established UN channels, including, [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9685.92s)]
*  where appropriate, through seeking a waiver. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9691.92s)]
*  Finally, even if security measures were permitted, they would have to be applied in good faith, [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9694.92s)]
*  consistent with Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Charter and customary international law. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9702.92s)]
*  Israel's invocation of security is undermined by the disproportionate and systematic nature of its actions. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9707.92s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, this concludes my presentation. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9714.92s)]
*  I thank you for your attention. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9719.92s)]
*  May I ask you, Mr. President, to call Professor Ralph Wilde to the podium? [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9721.92s)]
*  I thank Dr. Reedy. I now invite Professor Ralph Wilde to address the Court. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9727.92s)]
*  You have the floor. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9733.92s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Court, [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9739.92s)]
*  It's a great honour and privilege to appear before you again and represent the Plurian National State of Bolivia. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9742.92s)]
*  As the Court held in its 2024 advisory opinion, [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9750.92s)]
*  Israel's presence in the Palestinian Gaza Strip and West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is, in and of itself, illegal. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9755.92s)]
*  It's a violation of the legal right of self-determination of the Palestinian people. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9766.92s)]
*  It's conducted for the unlawful purpose of purported annexation. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9772.92s)]
*  It must, in the words of the Court, end as rapidly as possible. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9778.92s)]
*  These findings presuppose that Israel has no valid legal basis to maintain the presence. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9785.92s)]
*  Had there been a valid legal basis, the Court would not have called for the presence to end. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9794.92s)]
*  The Court characterised the presence as a use of force, [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9803.92s)]
*  the legality of which determined by the law of the use of force. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9808.92s)]
*  Since using force without a valid legal basis is a breach of the yos ad bellam, [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9813.92s)]
*  the implication of the Court's finding that the presence should end [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9821.92s)]
*  is that the presence is an unlawful use of force, an aggression. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9827.92s)]
*  Only the state of Palestine and the Palestinian people have the legal right to exercise authority in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, including East Jerusalem. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9834.92s)]
*  In consequence, only they have the legal right to decide who can enter and be present there [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9847.92s)]
*  and which activities those present can engage in. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9855.92s)]
*  Conversely, as its presence is illegal, Israel necessarily lacks a valid entitlement to do anything there. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9860.92s)]
*  Insofar then, as the presence continues, every activity performed is itself illegal, as an integral part of an illegal presence. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9872.92s)]
*  In consequence, Israel has no legal right to take any action in the OPT, [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9887.92s)]
*  restricting the entry, presence and activities of other actors. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9895.92s)]
*  Any such action, on whatever basis, is therefore illegal. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9901.92s)]
*  That said, in particular circumstances, the rules regulating the conduct of the Israeli presence, including occupation law, [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9909.92s)]
*  don't prevent and even permit and require certain restrictions on the entry, presence and activities of other actors. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9920.92s)]
*  Given this, it might be suggested that international law creates a paradoxical, perverse situation. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9932.92s)]
*  On the one hand, as the court determined, the presence is unlawful and should therefore end as rapidly as possible. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9942.92s)]
*  On the other hand, because Israel defies the court and continues its illegal presence, [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9953.92s)]
*  obligations are then triggered, permitting it to decide on the presence of other actors, [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9961.92s)]
*  and do so against the wishes of the only legal persons entitled to do this. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9969.92s)]
*  This suggestion would be to misunderstand the relative significance of the two areas of law. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9978.92s)]
*  As the court held, the legal rules governing the conduct of the presence apply even though the presence is illegal. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9987.92s)]
*  However, because of that illegality, all Israel's actions performed as part of the presence will be illegal on this basis, [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=9998.92s)]
*  including actions compliant with and pursuant to the rules regulating conduct. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10009.92s)]
*  Thus, ultimately, restrictions that are lawful according to the rules regulating conduct remain unlawful [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10018.92s)]
*  according to the law of self-determination and the yos ad belim, [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10029.92s)]
*  since they are performed as part of a presence that is, as a general, unqualified matter, illegal. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10034.92s)]
*  On this basis, Israeli restrictions in the OPT on the entry, presence and activities of other actors [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10044.92s)]
*  are breaches of Israel's obligations owed to the Palestinian people and the state of Palestine. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10053.92s)]
*  Moreover, such restrictions are also violations of other obligations Israel owes to states. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10060.92s)]
*  Many states are present in the OPT on a profoundly different basis than Israel, [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10071.92s)]
*  conducting diplomatic relations with the state of Palestine and other Palestinian entities. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10079.92s)]
*  These and other states also provide material assistance to the Palestinian people there, [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10086.92s)]
*  directly and by supporting provision by others, notably UNRWA. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10093.92s)]
*  As the court held, because of the fundamental nature of the Palestinian right of self-determination [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10101.92s)]
*  violated by Israel in maintaining its presence in the OPT, [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10109.92s)]
*  all states bear a special legal duty to bring the violation to an end. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10116.92s)]
*  States discharge this duty through activities seeking to mitigate the violation. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10124.92s)]
*  Conducting diplomatic relations with Palestinian counterparts in the OPT [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10131.92s)]
*  repudiates Israel's unlawful claim to sovereignty [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10136.92s)]
*  and implicitly or expressly recognizes Palestinian sovereignty. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10141.92s)]
*  Providing assistance reduces the dependency of the Palestinian people on the right of self-determination. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10149.92s)]
*  Providing assistance reduces the dependency of the Palestinian people on the state [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10158.92s)]
*  perpetuating its subjugation of them through its presence. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10165.92s)]
*  Israeli restrictions conducted in the OPT to the entry, presence and activities of states [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10172.92s)]
*  breach Israel's obligation of non-interference in the freedom of action of these states. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10179.92s)]
*  The restrictions on states and the other actors they support, such as UNRWA, [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10188.92s)]
*  impede their ability to perform activities benefiting the Palestinian people. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10195.92s)]
*  As a result, they constitute an unlawful interference by Israel [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10202.92s)]
*  in these states' ability to discharge that special legal duty owed to the Palestinian people. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10208.92s)]
*  The consequence of the Court's finding in the 2024 Advisory Opinion [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10217.92s)]
*  that Israel's presence in the OPT is, in and of itself, illegal is as follows. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10222.92s)]
*  Israel must end its presence. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10230.92s)]
*  It has no legal right to take any action there restricting the entry, presence and activities [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10233.92s)]
*  of states and international organizations, including UNRWA. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10241.92s)]
*  Any such action is illegal. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10246.92s)]
*  This is because it's part of a presence breaching the right of self-determination [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10250.92s)]
*  of the Palestinian people and the Yos Adbelem. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10256.92s)]
*  Also, and in consequence, it violates Israel's obligation not to interfere [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10261.92s)]
*  in the sovereign freedom of action of the states concerned. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10268.92s)]
*  And, in particular, it violates Israel's obligation not to impede their action of solidarity, [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10273.92s)]
*  whether performed directly or through support given to other actors, [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10283.92s)]
*  discharging the special legal duty owed to the Palestinian people. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10289.92s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court, [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10297.92s)]
*  the peoples of the world are shocked at the continued failure of the international community [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10302.92s)]
*  to end the colonial subjugation and genocide of the Palestinian people. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10311.92s)]
*  They ask, what is the use of international law? [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10318.92s)]
*  Bolivia is here as one of the states seeking to answer this call, [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10324.92s)]
*  based on the Court's determination that states must act and not be bystanders. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10331.92s)]
*  We respectfully request that the Court safeguard states' ability to discharge their special legal duty to act [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10340.92s)]
*  by affirming Israel's obligations not to interfere in this. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10351.92s)]
*  Mr. President, this concludes my presentation and the submissions of Bolivia. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10357.92s)]
*  We thank you for your kind attention. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10363.92s)]
*  I thank the representatives of Bolivia for their presentation. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10366.92s)]
*  I now invite the delegation of Brazil to address the Court, [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10371.92s)]
*  and I give the floor to Mr. Marcelo Viegas. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10376.92s)]
*  Mr. President of the International Court of Justice, Judge Yuji Ishikawa, [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10387.92s)]
*  allow me to start by congratulating you on your election to preside this Court, [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10394.92s)]
*  and also to extend a nod to Judges Juan Manuel Gomez Robledo and Leonardo Neymar Caldera Branche, [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10399.92s)]
*  both of whom I had the honor and privilege to meet and work with previously, [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10405.92s)]
*  and whose presence amongst you only confirms the degree of excellence of this highest Court. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10410.92s)]
*  Distinguished members of the Court, it is an honor to speak on behalf of Brazil [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10415.92s)]
*  before the International Court of Justice, the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10421.92s)]
*  We are gathered in this Chamber to fulfill yet another stage of the mandate entrusted to this Court [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10427.92s)]
*  by the United Nations General Assembly, which, through Resolution 79-232 of December 19, 2024, [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10433.92s)]
*  requested this Court to render an advisory opinion on Israel's obligations regarding the presence [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10442.92s)]
*  and activities of the United Nations, other international organizations, and third party states [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10448.92s)]
*  in and in relation to the occupied Palestinian territory. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10455.92s)]
*  Brazil, alongside 52 other countries, co-sponsored the Resolution and submitted a written statement [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10461.92s)]
*  to the Court on the 28th of February, grounding our stance in our unwavering commitment [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10469.92s)]
*  to promoting international law and recognizing the crucial role of the International Court of Justice [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10476.92s)]
*  in fostering justice and peace. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10482.92s)]
*  In the first phase of the proceedings, over 40 countries and international organizations [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10487.92s)]
*  chose to participate and furnish elements to support the Court's deliberation. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10492.92s)]
*  The widespread engagement highlights not only the importance of the matter at hand, [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10497.92s)]
*  but also the grave concern that Israel's actions in Palestine, not only in Gaza, but also in the West Bank, [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10502.92s)]
*  including East Jerusalem, have sparked within the international community. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10509.92s)]
*  The ongoing catastrophe in Gaza, now reaching 18 months, has already claimed over 51,000 lives, [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10516.92s)]
*  most of whom women and children. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10524.92s)]
*  After a brief ceasefire, during which hostages were released and desperately needed humanitarian aid, [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10526.92s)]
*  was temporarily allowed to reach the population of Gaza, [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10533.92s)]
*  Israel resumed blocking food, medicine, and other essential supplies from entering the territory, [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10537.92s)]
*  restarted its attacks, and launched a new ground offensive in Gaza. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10543.92s)]
*  In this troubling context, the present advisory opinion is sorely and urgently needed. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10548.92s)]
*  Mr. President, the written statement submitted by Brazil expresses the view that the Court has jurisdiction [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10556.92s)]
*  to issue the requested advisory opinion in accordance with Article 65.1 of its statute. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10564.92s)]
*  There is, therefore, no reason for the Court to refrain from issuing the requested advisory opinion. [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10572.92s)]
*  The issue before the Court does not constitute a bilateral dispute that would warrant the non-exercise of its jurisdiction. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10578.92s)]
*  On the contrary, it concerns legal obligations in a general sense, [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10586.92s)]
*  within the scope of multilateral agreements and treaties, which must be complied with and respected. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10591.92s)]
*  Distinguished judges, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination has already been recognized by this Court. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10598.92s)]
*  Self-determination is one of the essential principles of international law, [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10607.92s)]
*  explicitly enshrined in the United Nations Charter and considered by the General Assembly [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10612.92s)]
*  as an inseparable element of fundamental human rights. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10618.92s)]
*  As stated by the Court, self-determination entails, among other elements, [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10622.92s)]
*  the right to territorial integrity and the right to freely determine its political status [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10628.92s)]
*  and to pursue its economic, social, and cultural development. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10634.92s)]
*  Indeed, the General Assembly has repeatedly affirmed the Palestinian people's right to self-determination, [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10638.92s)]
*  including the right to an independent and sovereign state of Palestine. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10646.92s)]
*  Other United Nations bodies, such as the Human Rights Council, have done the same. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10650.92s)]
*  In its advisory opinion on the legal consequences of Israel's practices and policies in the occupied Palestinian territory, [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10655.92s)]
*  including East Jerusalem, this Court stated that Israel, as the occupying power, [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10663.92s)]
*  has the obligation not to impede the Palestinian people from exercising its right to self-determination, [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10670.92s)]
*  including its right to an independent and sovereign state over the entirety of the occupied Palestinian territory. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10677.92s)]
*  In this regard, Brazil contends and hopes that the Court will acknowledge that all the measures [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10685.92s)]
*  systematically adopted by Israel to impede or hinder the presence and activities of the United Nations, [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10694.92s)]
*  other international organizations, and third-party states in the occupied Palestinian territory [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10700.92s)]
*  blatantly violate not only the Palestinian right to self-determination, [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10706.92s)]
*  but also other fundamental obligations under general international law. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10711.92s)]
*  Mr. President, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10716.92s)]
*  was established by the General Assembly in 1949 to provide assistance to Palestinian refugees. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10726.92s)]
*  Only the General Assembly has the authority to review or revoke its mandate, [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10733.92s)]
*  which cannot be subjected to restrictions imposed by any domestic legislation. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10738.92s)]
*  UNRWA is the backbone of the United Nations humanitarian operations in favor of Palestinian refugees [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10744.92s)]
*  providing education, health care, social services, and emergency assistance. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10751.92s)]
*  It provides aid for over 6 million people. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10758.92s)]
*  Its presence and work are even more urgent in the current context of near-total destruction in Gaza, [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10761.92s)]
*  where it serves over 2 million people. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10767.92s)]
*  In 2024, contrary to international law, Israel passed two bills aimed at severely hindering UNRWA's operations [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10771.92s)]
*  within the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10780.92s)]
*  At the time, Brazil immediately expressed its grave concern regarding this measure. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10785.92s)]
*  We emphasized that it constitutes a blatant violation of international law [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10791.92s)]
*  in direct opposition to binding decisions of this court related to the occupying power's obligation [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10796.92s)]
*  to ensure humanitarian access to the citizens of the occupied Palestinian territory. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10804.92s)]
*  As a member of UNRWA's advisory commission, in which it currently holds one of the two vice-presidencies, [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10810.92s)]
*  Brazil urged the Israeli government to refrain from implementing these provisions [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10818.92s)]
*  in order to allow UNRWA's work to continue in all the occupied Palestinian territory. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10823.92s)]
*  We regret that Israel has not revisited this measure, [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10829.92s)]
*  having instead undertaken measures to prevent UNRWA from carrying out its activities, especially in East Jerusalem. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10835.92s)]
*  And we hope that this court will declare the absolute illegality of these actions. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10842.92s)]
*  There is no realistic alternative to UNRWA in providing services and assistance to the Palestinian refugees. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10848.92s)]
*  Any attempt to obstruct UNRWA's operations, whether through legislative, financial, or physical barriers, [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10855.92s)]
*  does not alter the established rights of Palestinian refugees. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10863.92s)]
*  Hindering or undermining the ability of UNRWA to fulfill its mandate [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10868.92s)]
*  does not alter the established legal protections afforded to Palestinian refugees. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10873.92s)]
*  Both as the occupying power, as well as a member of the United Nations, [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10879.92s)]
*  Israel is obligated to facilitate and enable UNRWA's operations in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10886.92s)]
*  It cannot interfere with or obstruct the exercise of this mandate, which was established by the General Assembly. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10893.92s)]
*  Distinguished judges, I will now make specific remarks regarding Israel's obligations as an occupying power. [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10901.92s)]
*  In its wall advisory opinion, the court confirmed that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to any territory occupied [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10911.92s)]
*  following an armed conflict between high contracting parties. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10920.92s)]
*  Israel and Jordan were both parties to the Convention when the 1967 conflict broke out. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10924.92s)]
*  Therefore, the court found that the Convention applies to the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since that time. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10933.92s)]
*  This position had already been asserted by the Security Council in Resolutions 636 and 641. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10941.92s)]
*  In its 2024 advisory opinion, the court reaffirmed that the occupied Palestinian territory is a single territorial unit [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10949.92s)]
*  and that Gaza remains an integral part of the area occupied by Israel in 1967. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10959.92s)]
*  Although Israel had withdrawn its military presence from Gaza in 2005, [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10965.92s)]
*  it continued to exercise control over the territory in key ways, [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10971.92s)]
*  including through restrictions on movement, border control, taxation, and military operations in the buffer zone. [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10976.92s)]
*  This control has terrifyingly evolved since October 2023. [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10984.92s)]
*  As an occupying power, Israel has legal obligations under the law of occupation. [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10990.92s)]
*  The occupying power must administer the territory for the benefit of the local population while refraining from any acts of sovereignty. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=10997.92s)]
*  The obligations of an occupying power are clearly outlined in the relevant conventions [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11007.92s)]
*  and consistently restated in this court's opinions and in permanent resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council. [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11013.92s)]
*  Israel must guarantee public order and safety while respecting local laws. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11023.92s)]
*  It must also ensure access to essential services, including education, medical care, food, and humanitarian aid. [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11030.92s)]
*  Any failure to meet these obligations constitutes a blatant violation of international law. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11039.92s)]
*  In other words, the international obligation to protect the civilian population is not limited to the duty of refraining from attacking civilians [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11046.92s)]
*  or international organizations or third states providing humanitarian assistance. [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11056.92s)]
*  In fact, it embodies the obligation to respect and ensure respect, [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11061.92s)]
*  which in any unbiased view also entails the positive duty to facilitate such assistance as provided for, [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11068.92s)]
*  for example, in Security Council Resolution 2720 of 2023, [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11077.92s)]
*  which demands the facilitation and enablement of the immediate, safe, and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance. [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11083.92s)]
*  In the proceedings instituted by South Africa against Israel concerning the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip, [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11092.92s)]
*  this court issued on 26 January 2024 provisional measures ordering Israel to allow the urgent provision of humanitarian aid. [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11104.92s)]
*  On 28 March 2024, the court reinforced this obligation ordering Israel to ensure the delivery of food, water, fuel, electricity, medical supplies, and shelter in full cooperation with the United Nations. [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11115.92s)]
*  Furthermore, the court ruled that Israel's military must not obstruct humanitarian assistance or commit acts that violate the rights of Palestinians in Gaza under the Genocide Convention. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11132.92s)]
*  Under Article 94 of the UN Charter, these measures are binding. [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11145.92s)]
*  Beyond legal restrictions, physical barriers to humanitarian assistance such as border closures, travel restrictions, and denial of reentry are also unacceptable. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11152.92s)]
*  These actions only deepen the suffering of the Palestinian people. [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11164.92s)]
*  Israel cannot prohibit, restrict, or hinder the United Nations, other international organizations, or third states from providing humanitarian assistance in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11169.92s)]
*  The situation in the occupied Palestinian territory is not only a humanitarian tragedy and a political disaster, but it also entails serious breaches of preemptory norms of international law. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11185.92s)]
*  The principles at stake, self-determination, the prohibition of annexation, and the protection of civilians under occupation, are at the core of international law. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11200.92s)]
*  Compliance with the Fourth Geneva Convention and the rulings of this court is not optional. It is a legal imperative. [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11214.92s)]
*  Under these conditions, Israel cannot invoke domestic law to exempt itself from the responsibility arising from these obligations. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11224.92s)]
*  In line with what this court affirmed in its 1996 advisory opinion on the legality of the threat of use of nuclear weapons, paragraph 79, and I quote, [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11233.92s)]
*  A great many rules of humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict are so fundamental to the respect of the human person and elementary considerations as humanity, [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11246.92s)]
*  as the court put it in its judgment of 9 April 1949 in the Corfu Channel case, that the Hague and Geneva Conventions have enjoyed a broad accession. [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11258.92s)]
*  Further, these fundamental rules are to be observed by all states, whether or not they have ratified the conventions that contain them, because they constitute intransgressible principles of international customary law. End of quote. [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11270.92s)]
*  Mr. President, Brazil also wishes to highlight Israel's obligations not only as an occupying power and under the international humanitarian law, but also as a member of the United Nations. [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11287.92s)]
*  This encompasses obligations concerning the privileges and immunities of the United Nations and its agencies, particularly UNRWA. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11300.92s)]
*  The UN Charter in Article 2, paragraph 3, established that all member states must fulfill their obligations in good faith. [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11309.92s)]
*  Additionally, Article 2, paragraph 5, mandates that all states provide the United Nations with every assistance necessary for the implementation of its actions. [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11318.92s)]
*  Consequently, Israel is legally required to facilitate UNRWA's operations in accordance with the relevant decisions of competent UNRWA organs, including the General Assembly Resolution 302 and subsequent resolutions that have consistently renewed UNRWA's mandate. [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11331.92s)]
*  Furthermore, all UN member states must respect the privileges and immunities granted to the organization, its subsidiary bodies, and specialized agencies. [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11352.92s)]
*  Article 105 of the Charter affirms that the United Nations shall enjoy, in the territory of each member, the privileges and immunities necessary for the fulfillment of its purposes. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11364.92s)]
*  This protection extends to representatives of member states and officials of the organization, ensuring their ability to exercise their functions independently. [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11378.92s)]
*  Since 1949, Israel has been a party to the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the General Convention, which applies to UNRWA as a subsidiary body of the General Assembly and therefore an integral part of the UN system. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11392.92s)]
*  The General Convention clearly stipulates, in Section 3, that UN premises are inviolable and that UN property and assets, regardless of location, are immune from search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation, and any other form of interference, whether by executive, administrative, judicial, or legislative action. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11411.92s)]
*  Additionally, the organization and its property are exempt from all direct taxes under Section 7. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11435.92s)]
*  United Nations officials also benefit from specific protections under Section 18 of the General Convention, including immunity from legal proceedings regarding acts performed in their official capacity, exemption from taxation on their salaries, and immunity from national service obligations. [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11442.92s)]
*  These officials, along with their families, are protected from immigration restrictions and granted privileges like those enjoyed by diplomatic personnel. [[03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11460.92s)]
*  Experts on UN missions are also granted necessary immunities to ensure the independent exercise of their functions, including immunity from arrest, detention, and legal proceedings, as established in Section 22. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11469.92s)]
*  Additionally, the General Convention mandates that the United Nations laissez-passer be recognized as a valid travel document by all member states, and that visa applications from UN personnel traveling for official business be processed expeditiously, Section 25. [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11484.92s)]
*  Israel has long recognized these obligations. [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11505.92s)]
*  The exchange of letters constituting the provisional agreement between UNRWA and Israel of 14 June 1967, known as the Kamei-Michelmore Agreement, explicitly confirmed that the General Convention governs the relationship between Israel and UNRWA. [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11509.92s)]
*  However, Israel's obligations towards the United Nations and its agencies do not derive from this bilateral agreement. [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11528.92s)]
*  As established in the General Convention, to which Israel is still a party, they exist independently under international law and remain binding, regardless of the recent enactment in the Israeli Knesset of the unlawful piece of legislation aimed at ceasing UNRWA's operation. [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11537.92s)]
*  Israel, therefore, cannot invoke the termination of the Kamei-Michelmore Agreement as justification for failing to uphold its obligations under the UN Charter and the General Convention. [[03:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11557.92s)]
*  Moreover, any alleged misconduct by UN personnel must be addressed exclusively through the mechanisms established in the General Convention. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11570.92s)]
*  This does not alter Israel's duty to respect the inviolability of UN premises as a principle of fundamental character already underscored by this Court. [[03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11581.92s)]
*  As such, military expediency cannot justify violations of UN privileges and immunities. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11593.92s)]
*  Brazil also underscores that Israel cannot rely on its domestic laws, including recent legislative measures, to evade compliance with its international commitments. [[03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11603.92s)]
*  Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties unequivocally affirms that states cannot invoke their national laws as a justification for failure to perform their international obligations. [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11615.92s)]
*  Israel, as a state party to the UN Charter, has a binding legal duty to facilitate UNRWA's work in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11628.92s)]
*  The issue is not merely one of technicalities or bureaucratic maneuvering. [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11639.92s)]
*  The lives of millions of Palestinians depend on the provision of humanitarian assistance, and this Court's opinion is crucial in reaffirming Israel's legal obligations toward the United Nations and its agencies. [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11645.92s)]
*  Israel's failure to facilitate UNRWA's operations as a means of obstructing humanitarian assistance constitutes a direct violation of its international legal obligations. [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11661.92s)]
*  Therefore, Brazil respectfully urges the International Court of Justice to affirm Israel's obligations under international law concerning the privileges and immunities of the United Nations, [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11675.92s)]
*  and to demand that Israel cease all measures aimed at restricting the activities of UNRWA in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11688.92s)]
*  Only through full cooperation with the United Nations can Israel comply with its obligations under the UN Charter, the Fourth Geneva Convention, and other binding international legal instruments. [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11698.92s)]
*  Distinguished members of the Court, [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11714.92s)]
*  In recent weeks, new and severe antecedents of direct attacks by Israel against staff of international organizations and humanitarian aid providers continued to occur. [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11716.92s)]
*  On the 30th of March, the bodies of 15 humanitarian workers from the Palestinian Red Crescent, Civil Defense, and UNRWA were discovered in Rafa, buried in a mass grave, having been killed by Israeli forces while participating in rescue operations in the southern Gaza Strip the previous week. [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11729.92s)]
*  In April, Israel bombed a building in the Jabalia refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip, which housed a clinic operated by UNRWA. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11750.92s)]
*  The clinic had been turned into an improvised shelter for Palestinians displaced by the conflict. [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11762.92s)]
*  The attack caused at least 19 deaths, including that of nine children. [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11768.92s)]
*  Over 51,000 Palestinians have lost their lives in Gaza. [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11775.92s)]
*  Hundreds of humanitarian workers, whose work was solely aimed at saving lives or providing some relief to a desperate population, have also been killed. [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11780.92s)]
*  It is within this context that the present advisory opinion is framed. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11791.92s)]
*  For the reasons presented above, Brazil reaffirms and respectfully invites the Court to declare that. [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11797.92s)]
*  The Court has and should exercise its advisory jurisdiction. [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11804.92s)]
*  B. The Palestinian people have the inalienable right to self-determination and to their independent sovereign state, which includes the right to freely establish diplomatic relations and permanent diplomatic missions without external interference. [[03:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11811.92s)]
*  C. As the occupying power, Israel must comply with international humanitarian law, including the Hague regulations and the Fourth Geneva Convention. [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11828.92s)]
*  Israel is therefore under a non-derogable obligation not only to refrain from impeding or hindering the presence and activities of the United Nations, other international organizations, and third-party states in the occupied Palestinian territory, [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11839.92s)]
*  but also to facilitate and enable the immediate, safe, and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale, directly to the Palestinian civilian population in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11856.92s)]
*  D. As a member of the United Nations, Israel must fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by it in accordance with the Charter, including the obligation to give the United Nations and its agencies every assistance and any action it takes in accordance with the Charter. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11872.92s)]
*  E. Israel is under the obligation to respect the privileges and immunities of the United Nations and its agencies in accordance with the Charter and the General Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11891.92s)]
*  We are confident that these are the inescapable conclusions that this Court will reach. Thank you. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11906.92s)]
*  I thank the representative of Brazil for his presentation. Before I invite the next delegation to take the floor, the Court will observe a coffee break of 15 minutes. The hearing is suspended. [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=11913.92s)]

*  Thank you. [[03:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=12963.92s)]
*  The Court! [[03:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=12993.92s)]
*  Please be seated. [[03:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13023.92s)]
*  The sitting is resumed. [[03:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13053.92s)]
*  I now invite the next participating delegation, Chile, to address the Court, and I call His Excellency Claudio Toronso to the podium. [[03:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13055.92s)]
*  You have the floor, sir. [[03:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13066.92s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, it is an honor to appear before you in these advisory proceedings on behalf of the Republic of Chile. [[03:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13068.92s)]
*  The question submitted to the Court is urgent, and comes at a time when international law and the relevance of international organizations are as important as they have ever been. [[03:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13093.92s)]
*  In Chile's view, an opinion of the Court on this matter is pivotal to affirming and upholding the rule of international law and reinforcing the legitimacy of international norms. [[03:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13110.92s)]
*  Chile recognizes that these proceedings are rooted in the context of the complex situation in the occupied Palestinian territories. [[03:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13127.92s)]
*  Chile has continuously supported the self-determination of the Palestinian people, advocating for peace and recognizing the right of both states to exist, and the right of the people who inhabit them to live a dignified and safe life. [[03:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13139.92s)]
*  In this regard, Chile would like to stress its firm condemnation of all violation of international law by all parties to the conflict, including the attacks conducted by Hamas on 7 October 2023 and the kidnapping of individuals whose immediate and unconditional release Chile demands. [[03:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13164.92s)]
*  When it comes to human suffering, each event is a tragedy. [[03:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13191.92s)]
*  In this presentation, we will develop three key points. [[03:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13200.92s)]
*  First, I will address the jurisdiction of the Court to render an advisory opinion, and in particular, the absence of compelling reasons to decline it. [[03:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13205.92s)]
*  Second, I will address the scope of the question presented to the Court by the General Assembly and the applicability of the obligations that have already been noted by most delegations in the written phase of the proceedings. [[03:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13218.92s)]
*  And lastly, Mrs. Valeria Chiappini will address the question of privileges and immunities of international organizations. [[03:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13236.92s)]
*  Moving to the first point, it is Chile's position that the Court has jurisdiction to give the requested advisory opinion, and that there are no compelling reasons for the Court to refuse to do so. [[03:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13248.92s)]
*  Some States have argued in the present proceedings that an advisory opinion would prejudge essential elements relevant to a pending case before this Court, namely the proceedings brought by South Africa against Israel regarding the application of the Genocide Convention. [[03:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13267.92s)]
*  Chile recalls that this Court made clear in its interpretation of the peace treaty's advisory opinion that the Court could decline to exercise its advisory jurisdiction in such cases where, and I quote, [[03:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13290.92s)]
*  the question put to it was directly related to the main point of a dispute actually pending between two States, so that answering the question would be substantially equivalent to deciding the dispute between the parties. [[03:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13305.92s)]
*  As was the case in interpretation of peace treaties, the question put to the Court in the present proceedings does not touch the merits of the aforementioned pending dispute. [[03:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13322.92s)]
*  And therefore, I quote, the legal position of the parties to this dispute cannot be in any way compromised by the answers that the Court may give to the question put to it. [[03:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13336.92s)]
*  In the pending dispute, South Africa is claiming that Israel is in breach of its obligations under the Genocide Convention. [[03:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13351.92s)]
*  Thus, the relevant question for the Court is whether the acts and omissions by Israel complained of by South Africa are genocidal in character and are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial, and ethnic group. [[03:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13361.92s)]
*  On the other hand, the question raised here concerns the obligation of Israel in relation to the presence and activities of the United Nations, including its agencies and bodies, other international organizations, and third States, which, as made clear by the delegations that have preceded me, encompass obligations to Israel. [[03:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13385.92s)]
*  These are the issues that arise from several bodies of law, including international humanitarian law, international human rights law, and the privileges and immunities of international organizations. [[03:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13415.92s)]
*  Therefore, although the provision of humanitarian assistance is an issue that arose in the case concerning the application of the Genocide Convention in the context of provisional measures, and it's also relevant to the present proceedings, [[03:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13430.92s)]
*  Chile submits that it is not a question that directly relates to the Court's dispute of that case. [[03:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13447.92s)]
*  Indeed, by answering the question put before it, the Court would not be deciding any aspect of the dispute between the parties in the contentious proceeding, because there are no direct links between the questions raised in the case concerning the application of Genocide Convention and the question put to the Court in the present proceedings. [[03:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13457.92s)]
*  Thus, rendering an advisory opinion would not compromise the legal positions of the parties to the dispute nor the fairness of the proceedings. Consequently, there are no compelling reasons for the Court to refuse to render the advisory opinion. [[03:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13481.92s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, this leads me to my second point regarding the scope of the question presented to the Court and the applicable rules. [[03:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13501.92s)]
*  The Court has had the opportunity to make findings in relation to the situation of the occupied Palestinian territory on two occasions. [[03:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13516.92s)]
*  First, on 9 July 2004, in its advisory opinion regarding the legal consequences of the construction of a wall, and second, 20 years later, on 19 July 2024, in its advisory opinion regarding the legal consequences that arise from Israel practices and policies in the OPD. [[03:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13528.92s)]
*  In this context, the present proceedings are meant to complement the aforementioned opinions by addressing questions that had not yet been put before the Court and consequently have not been answered. [[03:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13555.92s)]
*  In particular, while the previous advisory opinions address the obligations that Israel has in relation to Palestinian people, the present question seeks to identify the obligations that Israel has toward other relevant actors operating in and in relation to the occupied Palestinian territory. [[03:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13573.92s)]
*  More specifically, the question refers to the United Nations, including its agencies and bodies, other international organizations and third states. [[03:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13596.92s)]
*  The obligations that the Court was requested to identify relate to all international organizations and states operating in and in relation to the OPD. [[03:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13607.92s)]
*  However, Chile requests that the Court take note of the grave concern expressed by the General Assembly in the preamble of its resolution 79-232, which informs the present request from advisory opinion in relation to, and I quote, [[03:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13621.92s)]
*  Plans and measures, including legislation adopted by Israel to interfere with or obstruct the presence and operation of the United Nations and the United Nations entities and organizations, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. End of quote. [[03:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13643.92s)]
*  As was submitted in our written statement, it is Chile's position that the relevant obligations arise from Israel's dual role as both an occupant power and a member of the United Nations. [[03:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13670.92s)]
*  First, in its role as an occupant power, Israel is bound by international humanitarian law, particularly by the law of occupation and international human rights law, where applicable. [[03:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13687.92s)]
*  While it's true, as some have argued, that international humanitarian law does not directly focus on interaction between the occupant power and international organization or third state, it does focus on the protection of civilians and the occupied population. [[03:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13703.92s)]
*  In that context, it establishes obligations to provide humanitarian relief and basic services to the occupied population. [[03:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13724.92s)]
*  Furthermore, the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a party, establishes a specific obligation for the occupant power to grant any relief organization all facilities necessary for it to achieve its purpose within the bounds set by military or security considerations. [[03:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13736.92s)]
*  Chile notes that under Article 140.2 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, the scope of the activities that may be undertaken by relief organization is quite broad and would certainly encompass the activities of all 13 United Nations entities that maintain an ongoing presence in the OPT, [[03:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13763.92s)]
*  as has been identified by the UN Secretariat in the present proceedings. [[03:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13789.92s)]
*  As clarified by the International Committee of the Red Cross in its 1958 commentary to Article 30 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, the obligation of the occupant power to grant all facilities to relief organization is not met by merely authorizing them to carry out their work. [[03:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13797.92s)]
*  Rather, the occupant power must facilitate and promote their task. [[03:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13823.92s)]
*  This means that it must, and I quote, take all necessary steps to allow approved organizations to take rapid and effective action wherever they ask to give assistance. [[03:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13830.92s)]
*  End of quote. [[03:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13844.92s)]
*  While this obligation is certainly limited by military necessity and security needs, this reservation must be interpreted restrictively and should not be read as carte blanche for completely prohibiting the activities of such organizations, [[03:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13846.92s)]
*  especially when they have been given a mandate to address the occupied population of a particular area by the General Assembly. [[03:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13866.92s)]
*  Indeed, such limitations must only be imposed in good faith, and I quote, shall not hinder the supply of effective and adequate relief to all protect persons. [[03:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13879.92s)]
*  End of quote. [[03:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13893.92s)]
*  For these reasons, the occupant power should show moderation in their use of this reservation, applying it only in cases of real necessity in an exceptional and temporary manner. [[03:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13894.92s)]
*  These measures can never result in the paralysis of the relief effort, and while they last, the occupant power must make suitable arrangements on behalf of the protected population. [[03:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13911.92s)]
*  Turning next to Israel's second role as a UN member state. [[03:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13928.92s)]
*  Israel's obligation stems mainly from the UN Charter and the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. [[03:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13937.92s)]
*  For the sake of time, Chile directs the Court's attention to its written submissions for the complete identification of all the relevant obligations that are applicable, [[03:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13947.92s)]
*  and would like to highlight here the duty of all UN member states to collaborate with the United Nations enshrined in Article 2, Paragraph 5, and 56 of the UN Charter. [[03:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13961.92s)]
*  It is Chile's position that this duty includes all bodies, agencies and subsidiary organs of the United Nations, and involves not only the observance and implementation of the UN policies and decisions, [[03:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13978.92s)]
*  but also an obligation to cooperate in good faith with the organizations and abstain from obstructing their mandate. [[03:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=13996.92s)]
*  Your Excellencies, while this duty certainly applies in relation to binding Security Council decisions, contrary to what has been argued by some participants in the present proceedings, [[03:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14007.92s)]
*  Chile submits that this duty does not exclusively apply to action taken by the Security Council in accordance to Chapter 7. [[03:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14021.92s)]
*  Indeed, this Court has contradicted such narrow conception of the duty to collaborate in two ways. [[03:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14031.92s)]
*  First, this Court made clear that the Security Council can make binding decisions in exercise of any of its powers, not only those concerning enforcement actions under Chapter 7. [[03:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14038.92s)]
*  Second, this Court affirmed that, and I quote, [[03:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14056.92s)]
*  "...the effective working of the organization, the accomplishment of its task, and the independence and effectiveness of the work of its agents," end of quote, [[03:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14060.92s)]
*  "...requires the strict observance of the duty to cooperate under Article 2.5 of the UN Charter." [[03:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14071.92s)]
*  Further, considering that the obligations contained in Article 2.5 is one of the principles of the organization under which Member States must act in order to achieve the purpose of the United Nations, [[03:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14082.92s)]
*  it follows that this duty of cooperation applies to activities of the organization and all its organs and agencies. [[03:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14097.92s)]
*  A more restrictive interpretation would render this provision meaningless by limiting the scope of the principles of the Charter only to Article 25. [[03:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14108.92s)]
*  Nevertheless, even if the Court were to find that Article 2.5 only refers to Security Council decisions, [[03:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14121.92s)]
*  it still admits that the Security Council has decided to vest Israel with specific obligations to allow, facilitate, and enable the safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance in the OPT, [[03:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14129.92s)]
*  and to, I quote, "...ensure the safety and security of United Nations and associated personnel, those of its specialized agencies, and all other personnel engaged in humanitarian relief activities consistent with international humanitarian law, with predileges to the freedoms of movement and access." [[03:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14146.92s)]
*  End of quote. [[03:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14175.92s)]
*  Mr. President, with this I conclude the first part of Chile's presentation, and I kindly request that you give the floor to Mrs. Chiappini to address our last key point. [[03:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14179.92s)]
*  I thank Mr. Troncosso. I now give the floor to Ms. Valeria Chiappini. You have the floor, Madam. [[03:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14197.92s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, It is an honor to appear before you on behalf of the Republic of Chile. [[03:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14211.92s)]
*  In the remaining time, I will address the general obligation of all UN member states to accord to the United Nations such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the fulfillment of its purposes under Article 105 of the UN Charter. [[03:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14219.92s)]
*  This obligation is further detailed in the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, which I will herein refer to as the General Convention. [[03:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14236.92s)]
*  This obligation is brought in scope and applies to all principal and subsidiary organs of the United Nations, whether or not Member States have entered into any further agreement specifying them, or even if they have terminated such agreements. [[03:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14249.92s)]
*  Concerning this obligation, Chile would like to emphasize that Member States have a duty to guarantee immunity of jurisdiction and execution for the United Nations and its staff, and the inviolability of its premises, archives, and documents in a similar manner as those granted to diplomatic missions. [[03:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14266.92s)]
*  To put it differently, these privileges and immunities are not subject to any qualification whatsoever. [[03:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14290.92s)]
*  Nevertheless, some participants in the present proceedings have argued that these obligations would not be applicable where legitimate security concerns of a Member State are undermined by an abuse of the agency's privileges and immunities. [[03:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14299.92s)]
*  This, however, is not correct. [[03:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14315.92s)]
*  The object and purpose of these privileges and immunities is to ensure the independence of the organization and to guarantee that it carries out its mandate without any undue interference or financial gain by the host state. [[03:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14319.92s)]
*  Indeed, these privileges and immunities are only limited by that which is necessary for the organization's proper functioning. [[03:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14336.92s)]
*  In short, United Nations Member States are bound to accord the privileges and immunities that are necessary for the organization to perform their functions independently, effectively, and impartially. [[03:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14345.92s)]
*  In this regard, while Chile condemns any abuse of these privileges and immunities that may occur, Chile recalls that Member States are not allowed to take unilateral action against the privileges and immunities of the organization, its bodies, agencies, and staff in the presence of a perceived abuse. [[03:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14362.92s)]
*  A specific provision to this effect was included in the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies adopted one year after the General Convention. [[03:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14386.92s)]
*  Section 24 of the Convention of the Specialized Agencies provides a mechanism for state parties to resolve a situation in which they consider there has been an abuse of a privilege or immunity, [[03:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14397.92s)]
*  mandating them to engage in consultations with the concerned agency. [[04:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14411.92s)]
*  If such consultations fail, it is this very court who needs to determine, through an advisory opinion, whether such an abuse has occurred before any measure can be taken by the host state. [[04:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14417.92s)]
*  The original proposal of Subcommittee 1 of the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly was granting state parties to that Convention, in the event of such an abuse, the right to denounce it and terminate any obligation to give privileges and immunities to the specialized agencies of which it would still remain a member. [[04:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14433.92s)]
*  However, that proposal was met with several objections, including, first, that if such a provision were to be incorporated, the Specialized Agencies Convention would diverge considerably from the General Convention, which does not grant such right of denunciation. [[04:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14456.92s)]
*  Second, the provision would contradict the already accepted principle that specialized agencies should receive appropriate privileges and immunities as necessary to carry out their mandate. [[04:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14477.92s)]
*  And third, it seemed wrong in principle to permit a state to have the advantages of being a member of a specialized agency while denying it privileges and immunities necessary for its operations. [[04:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14491.92s)]
*  To be sure, Your Excellencies, while there is no similar provision contained in the General Convention, the same considerations still stand. [[04:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14506.92s)]
*  Namely, permitting a member state to unilaterally strip the organization and its officials of their necessary privileges and immunities would defeat their very object and purpose. [[04:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14516.92s)]
*  Indeed, in the United States diplomatic and consular staff Interan case, the Court affirmed the fundamental character of the principle of inviolability, and consequently found that the conduct of Iran would have been unjustified even if the alleged criminal activities of the United States had been established. [[04:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14530.92s)]
*  Mainly because the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations contained express provisions to address the abuse of privileges and immunities. [[04:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14553.92s)]
*  Similarly, the General Convention offers sufficient assurances against the abuse of privileges and immunities. [[04:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14564.92s)]
*  Sections 20 and 23 clearly establish, and I quote, that privileges and immunities are granted to officials and experts in the interest of the United Nations and not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves, end of quote. [[04:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14573.92s)]
*  And provide the Secretary General with the right and duty to waive the immunity of any official or expert in mission where such immunity would impede the course of justice. [[04:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14590.92s)]
*  In addition, Section 21 of the General Convention provides an obligation to the United Nations, and I quote, to cooperate at all times with the appropriate authorities of members to facilitate the proper administration of justice, secure the observance of police regulations, and prevent the occurrence of any abuse in connection with the privileges, immunities, and facilities, end of quote. [[04:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14602.92s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, Chile further recalls that under international law, measures of self-help are strictly limited to measures of retortion, countermeasures, and self-defense, and where tolerated are always deemed a measure of last resort. [[04:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14633.92s)]
*  In this regard, it is a well-established rule of international law that countermeasures cannot be exercised against privileges and immunities of any kind, including the inviolability of organs or agents of an international organization and of its premises, archives, and documents. [[04:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14654.92s)]
*  Lastly, Chile notes, as explained by the UN Secretariat, that any concerns regarding the abuse of privileges and immunities of the organization must be properly brought to its attention to be considered in the context of its legal framework. [[04:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14677.92s)]
*  In this connection, Chile stresses the importance that the relevant UN organs, including the General Assembly, strengthen its control over its agencies and subsidiary organs. [[04:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14697.92s)]
*  If, however, after the appropriate intervention of the relevant organs, any issue remains unresolved, the proper dispute resolution mechanism is already established in Section 30 of the General Convention. [[04:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14710.92s)]
*  Your Excellencies, The regime of privileges and immunities of international organizations is indispensable for the independent and effective functioning of all UN organs, including this very Court. [[04:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14728.92s)]
*  The erosion of these norms through unilateral action not only undermines legal certainty, but jeopardizes the very fabric of multilateral cooperation upon which the international order rests. [[04:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14745.92s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, this concludes Chile's presentation. Thank you for your kind attention. [[04:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14761.92s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, I now invite the next participating delegation, Spain, to address the Court. [[04:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14774.92s)]
*  I call upon Her Excellency Ambassador Consuelo Bermanea to take the floor. Madam, you have the floor. [[04:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14783.92s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court, it is an honor to address this Court on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain. [[04:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14791.92s)]
*  Spain is participating in these advisory proceedings in order to cooperate with the International Court of Justice in the exercise of its advisory powers. [[04:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14809.92s)]
*  Spain's oral statement will follow the same structure as the written observations submitted on February. [[04:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14823.92s)]
*  It will, therefore, make a distinction between Israel's obligations regarding the presence of activities of the United Nations, other international organizations, and third states in the occupied Palestinian territory, and with respect to that territory, as a member state of the United Nations on the one hand, and as an occupying power on the other. [[04:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14829.92s)]
*  This distinction is to some extent a formal one, made for illustrative purposes, since the legal questions raised are inextricably intertwined. [[04:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14854.92s)]
*  However, this formal distinction, which is a direct response to the question asked by the General Assembly, is useful in this context, as it calls for the obligations at stake of the member states of the UN nations pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations and to international law to be considered separately. [[04:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14866.92s)]
*  Certainly, the obligations to be examined are comprised in the following. [[04:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14890.92s)]
*  Rules in the Charter of the UN directly tied to the activities of the UN to maintain international peace and security. [[04:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14896.92s)]
*  Rules in the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the UN Nations of 1946, which form part of a wider body of diplomatic law. [[04:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14906.92s)]
*  Rules that determine the extent of the obligations assumed freely and in writing between subjects of international law. [[04:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14917.92s)]
*  And rules that refer to the protection of people and their property in the context of armed conflict and periods of crisis, which therefore aim to safeguard human dignity. [[04:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14926.92s)]
*  In other words, these rules either regulate vital aspects of international law and require states to act in a certain way in relation to the protection of central legal principles of international law, such as sovereignty, sustaining peace and elementary considerations of humanity. [[04:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14939.92s)]
*  Or are of a marked instrumental or procedural nature and aimed to safeguard and facilitate relations between subjects of international law in the form of treaties or immunities, even or especially in crisis situations. [[04:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14959.92s)]
*  Because of this, they are rules that go beyond the interest of a single state and presuppose the existence of a world community based on multilateralism and compliance with international law. [[04:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14978.92s)]
*  Spain's statement will have the following structure. [[04:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14992.92s)]
*  In the first part, I will address Israel's obligations as a member state of the United Nations. [[04:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=14996.92s)]
*  In the second part, we will examine Israel's obligations as an occupying power. [[04:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15002.92s)]
*  Israel was admitted as a member state of the United Nations under the General Assembly Resolution 273, Roman III, on 11 May 1949. [[04:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15009.92s)]
*  As a member state, Israel must respect the independence and autonomy of the United Nations and assist it in carrying out its activities. [[04:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15021.92s)]
*  Article 2.5 of the Charter sets out this obligation in general terms. [[04:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15031.92s)]
*  All members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present Charter. [[04:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15038.92s)]
*  This obligation is necessarily linked to the principle of autonomy and independence of the UN, contained in articles 100 and 104 of the Charter, [[04:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15047.92s)]
*  which is a logical consequence of the recognition of international legal personality of the United Nations. [[04:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15059.92s)]
*  In accordance with this principle of autonomy and independence, the United Nations is responsible for [[04:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15067.92s)]
*  1. determining the matters that fail within its mandate [[04:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15074.92s)]
*  2. selecting the most appropriate means of addressing those matters [[04:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15079.92s)]
*  and 3. if appropriate, establishing the organs, programs and agencies it considers best suited to perform the related functions. [[04:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15084.92s)]
*  In exercising these responsibilities, the UN must follow the established procedures. [[04:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15094.92s)]
*  Member states which participate in the decision-making process of the organization must cooperate in good faith with the UN. [[04:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15101.92s)]
*  Nothing prevents states from exercising their rights as member states of the United Nations [[04:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15110.92s)]
*  and calling for amendments to previous decisions adopted by its bodies. [[04:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15117.92s)]
*  They may do so with the sole limit of always acting in accordance with the Charter [[04:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15122.92s)]
*  and pursuant to the decision-making procedures of the competent bodies, and therefore not by means of an unilateral decision. [[04:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15128.92s)]
*  In Resolution 79-81, Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine, which was adopted on 3 December 2024, [[04:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15138.92s)]
*  the General Assembly reaffirmed the permanent responsibility of the United Nations with regard to the question of Palestine, [[04:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15152.92s)]
*  until it is resolved, in all aspects in accordance with international law and relevant resolutions. [[04:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15161.92s)]
*  Said responsibility was assumed by the United Nations early in its existence. [[04:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15168.92s)]
*  The duty of member states of the United Nations to assist the organization, which we have described in general terms, [[04:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15177.92s)]
*  crystallizes here as two obligations. [[04:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15186.92s)]
*  The first, to cooperate in good faith with the agencies and bodies of the UN, including UNRWA, [[04:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15191.92s)]
*  and the second, to not prevent them from carrying out their activities. [[04:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15199.92s)]
*  In this context, we must highlight the central role that the UN has attributed to UNRWA, [[04:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15205.92s)]
*  which was created by virtue of General Assembly Resolution 302, Roman IV, on 8 December 1949, [[04:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15211.92s)]
*  on assistance to Palestine refugees, whose mandate has been continuously renewed to date. [[04:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15221.92s)]
*  This mandate was established by the General Assembly in accordance with applicable procedure, [[04:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15228.92s)]
*  and may only be modified by the General Assembly. [[04:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15234.92s)]
*  No State may unilaterally change or cancel it. [[04:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15238.92s)]
*  As a member state of the UN and a State Party to the Convention of 1946, [[04:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15244.92s)]
*  Israel is not only required to respect the privileges and immunities of the United Nations agencies, funds and programs, [[04:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15250.92s)]
*  especially UNRWA, both in the U.P.-occupied Palestinian territory and in Israel, [[04:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15258.92s)]
*  but also to abstain from carrying out any executive, administrative, judicial or legislative action that curtail, [[04:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15264.92s)]
*  prevents or impedes the effective enjoyment of the privileges and immunities accorded to the United Nations and its staff. [[04:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15273.92s)]
*  The extent and content of these privileges and immunities should be understood in functional terms. [[04:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15282.92s)]
*  This functional nature does not empower States to unilaterally determine the extent of the recognized privileges and immunities of the organization, [[04:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15291.92s)]
*  or to apply the Convention to a specific situation, or to unilaterally decide which organs, programs and agencies are protected by the Convention, [[04:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15302.92s)]
*  or to decide who falls within the categories of officials or experts on missions. [[04:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15313.92s)]
*  Lastly, this functional nature does not authorize States to assess the conduct of staff and agents in the performance of their mandates. [[04:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15320.92s)]
*  These functions are primarily competences of the Secretary General. [[04:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15331.92s)]
*  This was established by the Court in paragraph 33 of its advisory opinion on difference relating to immunity from legal process of a special rapporteur on the Commission on Human Rights. [[04:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15335.92s)]
*  On the other hand, the Convention includes a number of measures to guarantee good faith and mutual trust between the organization and its Member States. [[04:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15350.92s)]
*  For instance, the right and the duty recognized to the Secretary General in Article 5, Section 20 and Article 6, Section 23, [[04:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15360.92s)]
*  2, waive the immunity of any official or expert in any case where, in his opinion, the immunity would impede the cause of justice and it can be waived without prejudice to the interests of the United Nations. [[04:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15371.92s)]
*  And the obligation of the United Nations to cooperate with the authorities of Member States to ensure the law is followed as set out on Article 5, Section 21. [[04:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15386.92s)]
*  Similarly, Article 8, Sections 29 and 30 establish a system for settlement of any disputes that may arise between the organization and the Member States regarding application of the privileges and immunities. [[04:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15398.92s)]
*  These mechanisms allow State parties to protect their legitimate interests and rights and to call attention to alleged non-fulfillment of mandates by organs, agencies and officials of the United Nations, and even to advise of potential abuse of privileges and immunities. [[04:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15414.92s)]
*  However, the mechanisms do not enable States to unilaterally judge the actions of the organs, agencies and officials or to unilaterally deprive them of their recognized privileges and immunities. [[04:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15433.92s)]
*  Either of these actions would go against obligations incumbent upon States. [[04:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15450.92s)]
*  Mr. President, I will now set forth Spain's position regarding Israel's obligation with respect to the subjects of public international law deriving from its status as an occupying power. [[04:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15456.92s)]
*  We will examine Israel's obligation under the international law of occupation. [[04:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15472.92s)]
*  These obligations, which are part of relevant international treaties and customary international law, have been already referred by the International Court of Justice in its advisory opinions of 2004 and 2024. [[04:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15479.92s)]
*  These obligations are a. As the occupying power, Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory and is legally obliged to refrain from exercising any acts of sovereignty. [[04:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15500.92s)]
*  The enactment of the cessation laws and any measures taken by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory on the basis of those laws and other applicable Israeli legislation appear to constitute an exercise of sovereign powers and are, therefore, inconsistent with Israel's obligations under international law. [[04:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15518.92s)]
*  b. Israel has the obligation to administer the occupied Palestinian territory for the benefit of the local population. [[04:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15543.92s)]
*  In its advisory opinion of 19 July 2024, the Court affirms that by virtue of its status as an occupying power, a State assumes a set of powers and duties with respect to the territory over which it exercises effective control. [[04:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15553.92s)]
*  In this context, the occupying power bears a duty to administer the territory for the benefit of the local population. [[04:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15573.92s)]
*  The nature and scope of these powers and duties are always premised on the same assumption, that occupation is a temporary situation to respond to military necessity and it cannot transfer title of sovereignty to the occupying power. [[04:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15582.92s)]
*  While Article 43 of the Hague Regulation does not, as such, specify the means by which the occupying power is required to fulfil this general duty, other, more specific rules of international humanitarian law give effect to this obligation. [[04:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15600.92s)]
*  c. Israel has the obligation to ensure that the local population's basic needs are met. [[04:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15618.92s)]
*  Paragraph 1 of Article 55 of the Fourth Geneva Convention imposes on the occupying power the obligation to meet the basic needs of the population. [[04:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15627.92s)]
*  To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the occupying power has the duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population, issued in particular if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate. [[04:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15638.92s)]
*  Paragraph 1 of Article 69 of the Protocol, additional to the Geneva Convention, complements and expands on the concept of basic needs, stating, [[04:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15656.92s)]
*  In addition to the duties specified in Article 55 of the Fourth Convention concerning food and medical supplies, the occupying power shall, to the fullest extent of the means available to it and without any adverse distinction, [[04:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15669.92s)]
*  also ensure the provisions of clothing, bedding, means of shelter, other supplies essential to the survival of the civilian population of the occupied territory, and objects necessary for religious worship. [[04:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15686.92s)]
*  d. Israel has the obligation to accept or allow the provisions of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population. [[04:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15701.92s)]
*  Article 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention imposes on the occupying power the obligation not only to agree, but also to facilitate the necessary relief schemes undertaken by other states or by impartial humanitarian organizations. [[04:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15710.92s)]
*  This obligation is recalled by the Court in the order of 26 January 2024, indicating provisional measures in which it affirms that Israel must take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance. [[04:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15729.92s)]
*  Moreover, international humanitarian law places limitations on a state's discretion to withhold consent in situations of occupation. [[04:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15751.92s)]
*  In case of necessity, the occupying power must agree to humanitarian assistance from other states or from international organizations. [[04:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15762.92s)]
*  e. Israel has the obligation to cooperate with the United Nations, international organizations, other states and local authorities. [[04:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15772.92s)]
*  The International Court of Justice reaffirmed this obligation in the specific case of Israel in its order of 28 March 2024, indicating provisional measures in the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip, [[04:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15783.92s)]
*  where the Court stated that Israel shall take the necessary and effective measures to ensure, without delay, in full cooperation with the United Nations, the unhindered provision at scale by all concerns of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance, [[04:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15804.92s)]
*  including food, water, electricity, fuel, shelter, clothing, hygiene and sanitation requirements, as well as medical supplies and medical care to Palestinians throughout Gaza, [[04:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15824.92s)]
*  including by increasing the capacity and number of land crossing points and maintaining them open for as long as necessary. [[04:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15838.92s)]
*  Even if the fulfillment of the obligation to facilitate the provisions of humanitarian assistance is subject to limitations for reasons of security, [[04:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15847.92s)]
*  this right of objection must be interpreted in the light of the principles of proportionality and humanity. [[04:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15859.92s)]
*  In addition, said right of objection must be interpreted in accordance with Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, [[04:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15868.92s)]
*  which establishes that protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, [[04:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15878.92s)]
*  of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced as a result of occupation of a territory into the institution. [[04:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15889.92s)]
*  Lastly, we must examine the withdrawal by the occupying power of consent to the presence and activities of humanitarian organizations and other States. [[04:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15904.92s)]
*  The law of cessation of UNRWA activities adopted by the Kessenets unilaterally provided for the termination of the agreement constituted in the exchange of letters between Israel and UNRWA on 14 June 1967. [[04:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15917.92s)]
*  Pursuant to international law, Israel does not have the right to unilaterally revoke the agreement with UNRWA, constituted by means of the aforementioned exchange of letters. [[04:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15937.92s)]
*  Moreover, the general principle of the consent of States must not be considered in isolation, [[04:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15950.92s)]
*  but in conjunction with other international obligations to which the State of Israel is subject. [[04:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15957.92s)]
*  The obligations of an occupying power are relevant in determining whether a refusal or withdrawal of consent is in compliance with an occupying power's obligations under international law. [[04:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15965.92s)]
*  In this regard, such termination must not only be in accordance with the laws of treaties, but also with international humanitarian law, international human rights law and the right to self-determination. [[04:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15980.92s)]
*  Israel's obligations concerning the presence and activities of the United Nations agencies, including UNRWA, draw their original legal basis from all the aforementioned conventions and obligations under the international law. [[04:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=15995.92s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished members of the Court, I shall now conclude by summarizing Spain's position regarding the questions put to the Court in a context in which the Secretary-General of the United Nations recalled on 14 April [[04:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16011.92s)]
*  that under international humanitarian law, in the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the occupying power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal. [[04:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16029.92s)]
*  The Secretary-General also recalled that under international humanitarian law, wounded and sick medical personnel and medical facilities, including hospitals, must be respected and protected. [[04:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16052.92s)]
*  Article 2, paragraph 5 of the Charter of the United Nations provides that all members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present Charter. [[04:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16068.92s)]
*  In Resolution 79-81, the General Assembly reaffirmed the permanent responsibility of the United Nations with regard to the question of Palestine. [[04:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16083.92s)]
*  It was in the context of such responsibility that UNRWA was created, with a clearly humanitarian and development-related mandate which has been consistently renewed until the present day and which cannot be unilaterally amended or cancelled by a Member State. [[04:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16095.92s)]
*  UNRWA is being prevented from fulfilling its mandate by the laws adopted by the Kessenet on 28 October 2024, which entered into force on 30 January this year. [[04:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16117.92s)]
*  These laws, and any subsequent measures to implement them, must be considered incompatible with the obligations of Israel to provide assistance to the Agency in the performance of its functions and the fulfilment of its mandate in Palestine. [[04:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16132.92s)]
*  Moreover, Israel, as a Member State of the United Nations and as a State Party to the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations of 1946, is obliged to respect the privileges and immunities of the UN as regards to the presence of the agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations, in particular UNRWA, both in the occupied Palestinian territory and in Israel. [[04:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16150.92s)]
*  Certain actions attributable to Israel may be in conflict with the set privileges and immunities. [[04:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16180.92s)]
*  Israel has occupied the Palestinian territory since 1967. [[04:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16189.92s)]
*  In the words of the Court, by virtue of its status as an occupying power, a State assumes a set of powers and duties with respect to the territory over which exercises effective control. [[04:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16195.92s)]
*  The illegality of the occupation does not release Israel from its obligations and responsibilities under international law towards the Palestinian population and towards other States. [[04:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16210.92s)]
*  The powers and obligations of Israel with respect to the occupied Palestinian territory are governed by international humanitarian law. [[04:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16224.92s)]
*  Articles 50, 55, 56, 59 and 60 of the Fourth Geneva Convention establish Israel's obligations to ensure and facilitate the fulfilment of the basic needs of the local civilian population, as previously stated by the Court. [[04:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16235.92s)]
*  In the event that Israel fails to fulfil the aforementioned obligations, Israel has the obligation to accept humanitarian assistance for the civilian population. [[04:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16255.92s)]
*  This obligation, provided for in Article 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, is well established in general international law. [[04:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16268.92s)]
*  Fulfillment of the aforementioned obligations to facilitate humanitarian assistance may indeed be subject to limitations for reasons of security. [[04:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16278.92s)]
*  However, this right of objection must be interpreted in the light of the principles of proportionality and humanity. [[04:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16291.92s)]
*  Moreover, as assessed by the Court, such reasons do not exist in the present case. [[04:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16300.92s)]
*  The laws adopted by the Kessenet in October 2024 constitute an arbitrary withholding of consent to humanitarian organisations, and in particular to UNRWA, to provide humanitarian assistance and therefore a breach of international humanitarian law applicable to all occupying powers. [[04:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGhsCKUXXk&t=16308.92s)]
*  In view of the above, it can be concluded that the prevention of the presence and activities of the United Nations, other international organisations and other states in and in relation to the occupied Palestinian territory is a violation of both the norms of international human rights law applicable to Israel and to the right of self-determination.
