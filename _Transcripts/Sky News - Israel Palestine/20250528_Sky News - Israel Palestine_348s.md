# Inside the West Bank village where Palestinians say they are being terrorised
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk)
*  These images show Jewish activists trying to stop Israeli settlers from taking over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=0.0s)]
*  the centre of Ras El Ein, a community in the West Bank. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=9.48s)]
*  You can see that the land was, I think you say in English, by the settlers. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=14.44s)]
*  What is unfolding here is not just a land dispute. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=22.04s)]
*  It is the systematic displacement of Palestinians, according to human rights groups. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=25.76s)]
*  So in front of us, up the hill, we can see the illegal outposts. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=32.04s)]
*  Rachel Abramowitz is a member of Looking the Occupation in the Eye. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=38.84s)]
*  They try to deter settler attacks. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  And what they do, they gradually invade the community, they expand, they terrorise the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=46.64s)]
*  people. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=53.96s)]
*  There's a purpose to that, isn't there? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=55.04s)]
*  There's a purpose to terrorise the people, to put them to flight, to cause them... [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=56.24s)]
*  To make them move? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=61.56s)]
*  To make them move and leave the place. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=62.56s)]
*  My fear is that all of these places will become taken over by Israelis. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=65.88s)]
*  I think we won't be able to push it or to prevent it for long. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=73.0s)]
*  Salam Kaabneh's family has lived on the land in Ras el Ein for more than 50 years. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=78.36s)]
*  Now with a surge in attacks, he fears they may be forced from their home. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=85.92s)]
*  They stole more than 2,000 sheep from us and we face daily assaults. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=91.52s)]
*  At night they attack and frighten our women and children. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=95.36s)]
*  They throw stones and fire bullets into the compound. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=98.12s)]
*  They drive around in cars, creating chaos and problems. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=100.92s)]
*  We suffer greatly. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=103.88s)]
*  Now we're surrounded as if under siege. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=105.16s)]
*  We wanted to understand more about the settlers' activities, so we went to the hilltop above [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=110.84s)]
*  Salam's hamlet where they'd moved in. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=116.36s)]
*  So we've just been at the Palestinian community, which is just over here, and we've seen what's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=119.96s)]
*  been going on. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  Up this road is the Israeli settlement. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=126.36s)]
*  It's an outpost. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=129.72s)]
*  It was established here about 15 months ago. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=130.72s)]
*  And there's lots of, they look like kids running towards us now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=134.0s)]
*  Not sure what kind of greeting we're going to get, but we're going to try and ask them [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=139.08s)]
*  what they've been doing and why they've been doing it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=142.24s)]
*  But it looks like they're not going to let us go any further forwards. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=145.84s)]
*  We're not looking for provocations or problems. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=148.8s)]
*  But we didn't get far. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=151.6s)]
*  The atmosphere hostile. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=153.0s)]
*  The car was quickly surrounded. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=154.84s)]
*  It became clear we were not welcome. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=158.08s)]
*  We left without answers, but with a deeper understanding of the fear under which these [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=163.2s)]
*  vulnerable Palestinian communities are living. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  The Israeli military, as the occupier, is responsible for the security of the Palestinians [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  here. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=179.16s)]
*  But more and more settlers act with impunity. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=180.16s)]
*  I would say it's daylight robbery of land supported by the Israeli authorities, and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=183.92s)]
*  ethnic cleansing of large parts of the West Bank from their Palestinian inhabitants in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=189.92s)]
*  order for the area to be used by Israel and for Israeli uses. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=195.6s)]
*  I'm Rossi from Sky News. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=201.64s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=203.76s)]
*  Shalom. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=204.76s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=205.76s)]
*  International condemnation of settler violence is growing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=206.76s)]
*  The British government sanctioned several prominent figures, including Daniela Weiss, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=210.36s)]
*  who's known as the godmother of the settler movement. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  But despite the backlash, she's now pushing plans to establish new settlements, this time [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=226.9s)]
*  We have more than a thousand families enrolled in these six groups. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=228.32s)]
*  They're planning to move to Gaza. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=234.24s)]
*  Some of them, no, all of them, are ready to do it right away, notwithstanding how dangerous [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=237.32s)]
*  the area is. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=242.52s)]
*  But Palestinians live here at the moment. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=243.52s)]
*  So if Palestinians live, then Jews can live. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  What's the problem? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=248.72s)]
*  Palestinians live here, so Jews will live here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=249.72s)]
*  So the Jews will push the Palestinians out? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=252.72s)]
*  We do not have to push them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=255.08s)]
*  They want to go. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=256.6s)]
*  It's hell for them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=258.16s)]
*  They want to go because they're being bombed? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=259.16s)]
*  No, the Arabs want to go because the Hamas tortures their own families. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=261.16s)]
*  It has nothing to do with the fact that Israeli military has dropped huge tonnage of bombs. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=266.68s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=272.76s)]
*  Whatever Israel does is just to prevent the next attack, God forbid, on Israel. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=274.0s)]
*  And she told us the sanctions will only accelerate settlements' expansion. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=279.92s)]
*  There will not be a Palestinian state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=284.96s)]
*  Never, ever. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=292.32s)]
*  We annex with facts on the ground. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  The goal is clear, to prevent any option of establishing any kind of state entity, whatever [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=296.26s)]
*  you call it, in the heartland of Israel. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=305.26s)]
*  If Netanyahu wanted to stop me, he could stop me. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=310.5s)]
*  The Israeli government says the accusations of ethnic cleansing are baseless and have [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=314.74s)]
*  no foundation in reality. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=319.7s)]
*  The human rights groups say what is happening here has gone far beyond creeping annexation, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  where the Palestinians hope to build a state is disappearing under Israeli settlements, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=328.64s)]
*  and with it the prospect of a two-state solution to resolve this conflict. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=333.76s)]
*  Alex Rossi, Sky News, in the Occupied West Bank. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I04SiWenvk&t=340.47999999999996s)]
