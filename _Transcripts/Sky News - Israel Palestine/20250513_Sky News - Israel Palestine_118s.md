# Parents of released hostage Edan Alexander deliver statement
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8)
*  It is wonderful to have it on home. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=0.0s)]
*  Really a gift from God to watch him, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=3.0s)]
*  Hadiyael, his brother, and his sister, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=6.0s)]
*  knowing that his suffering is over [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=10.0s)]
*  and that our family can finally begin to heal. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=13.0s)]
*  First and foremost, I want to thank President Trump, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=16.0s)]
*  Ambassador Witkoff, and the Special Envoy Buller. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=20.0s)]
*  During our family reunion, Ambassador Witkoff [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=24.0s)]
*  was waking up America's officials at 3 a.m. on the East Coast [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=27.0s)]
*  just to share the good news and encourage them to speak with our family. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=31.0s)]
*  We'll never be able to express what that means to us, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=35.0s)]
*  but we'll never, ever forget the tireless effort on Idan's behalf. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=40.0s)]
*  For our family, a joyful day, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=45.0s)]
*  for which we are in incredible depth and gratitude, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=49.0s)]
*  soon Idan will be home in the United States, in New Jersey, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=54.0s)]
*  watching his little brother play basketball, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=59.0s)]
*  reuniting with his friends in New Jersey. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=62.0s)]
*  He's 21 now, and those happy times may include a beer or two, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=65.0s)]
*  but we will never forget the first beer he had on the rooftop [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=70.0s)]
*  of this very building since his release. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=74.0s)]
*  Idan's release is not just about our family. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=78.0s)]
*  Because of the leadership of the President, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=82.0s)]
*  it also means that tomorrow, literally tomorrow, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=85.0s)]
*  a new negotiation will begin that could lead to the release of more hostages [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=88.0s)]
*  and eventually the end of this war. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=93.0s)]
*  For me personally and for my family, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=97.0s)]
*  the effort to bring home all 58 hostages will continue until they are all home. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=101.0s)]
*  We're hopeful that these negotiations will lead to that moment for all other families. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=110.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hedq4d7l_W8&t=116.0s)]
