Video Description: Thousands of Palestinians have flocked to aid distribution sites in Gaza with desperation for food overcoming concerns over Israeli-enforced checks at the centres.
Witnesses in Rafah said Israeli gunfire was heard after desperate people broke fences to reach supplies.
The Israeli military said its forces did not direct aerial gunfire towards the centre, but rather fired warning shots in an area outside the hub.

# Aid distribution centres overran as 'gunshots' heard | Israel-Hamas war
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8)
*  The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is an Israeli-American plan to distribute aid in Gaza and to ensure [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=0.0s)]
*  that it doesn't go to Hamas. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=9.08s)]
*  It started operations today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=11.16s)]
*  Two distribution points were opened, both in Rafah in the south of Gaza, inside an evacuation [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  zone and a five-kilometer round walk from the edge of the nearest safe zone. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=19.12s)]
*  IDF soldiers secured the surrounding area. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  We're standing here in this logistical area that the IDF built and will secure and will [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=29.08s)]
*  be run by a third party that will give the people of Gaza the aid directly. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  Every day thousands of Gazans will be able to come here, reach this third party and get [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=38.92s)]
*  the aid directly. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=44.96s)]
*  Thousands queued for food parcels, desperate after an Israeli blockade on Gaza that's lasted [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=48.44s)]
*  almost three months. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=53.8s)]
*  But by mid-afternoon the numbers were so large that one site was overrun. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=56.64s)]
*  There was chaos as people rushed to get food. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=61.64s)]
*  There was shooting and we fled. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=68.64s)]
*  We didn't take anything that would benefit us, help us get by given the famine that we [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=70.64s)]
*  are in. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=75.64s)]
*  We didn't benefit. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=76.64s)]
*  There was no order at all. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=77.64s)]
*  They could not control the people because of the extent of the famine affecting society. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=79.64s)]
*  The American contractors had to withdraw and there were sounds of automatic gunfire. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=86.64s)]
*  The IDF denies firing on the Palestinians and there have been no reports of injuries. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=91.64s)]
*  Aid organizations have criticized the initiative and refused to work with it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=97.64s)]
*  The Foundation's chief executive resigned on Sunday night saying that the plan didn't [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=103.64s)]
*  meet his standards of humanity or independence. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=107.64s)]
*  The organization's source of funding hasn't been revealed either, raising further questions. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=111.64s)]
*  It is a distraction from what is actually needed, which is a reopening of all the crossings [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=117.64s)]
*  into Gaza, a secure environment within Gaza and faster facilitation of permissions and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=125.64s)]
*  final approvals of all the emergency supplies that we have just outside the border. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=132.64s)]
*  The food boxes contain rice, flour, oil, sugar and biscuits. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=140.64s)]
*  The Foundation says that it will open two more distribution centers and expects to feed [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=147.64s)]
*  a million people by the end of the week. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=151.64s)]
*  The people of Gaza are at breaking point though. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=154.64s)]
*  The desperation and the security situation will only alleviate once aid starts entering [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=157.64s)]
*  Gaza in large volumes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=162.64s)]
*  The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says it can do that, but its critics, and there are [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=165.64s)]
*  many, will say that today's stampede is proof they can't. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=170.64s)]
*  Alistair Bunkle, Sky News, in Jerusalem. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XCxd7BzZ8&t=175.64s)]
