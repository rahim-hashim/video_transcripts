# British doctor in Gaza speaks to Sky
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8)
*  It's nearly seven o'clock in the morning and we've been up since about 5.00 because the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=0.0s)]
*  bombing's been really bad this morning. We've been watching jets screech past our heads [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=7.28s)]
*  and then drop bombs on the neighbouring vicinity. I'm standing on the balcony [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=14.0s)]
*  of the EMT accommodation and a really large bomb has just gone off not far to the east of us [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=20.639999999999997s)]
*  and the ambulances here have just readied themselves to go off and pick up who knows [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=33.36s)]
*  how many casualties. So I think we've got a lot of work heading our way. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=40.0s)]
*  Well Dr Rose joins me now from Nasa Hospital in Khan Yunus. Thank you so much Dr Rose for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=46.0s)]
*  joining us here on the programme. Your video diaries have been crucial in documenting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=53.92s)]
*  what's going on there because of course we journalists can't enter Gaza so your work [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=58.96s)]
*  is critical in helping audiences, helping people understand but just help us better understand [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=63.44s)]
*  right now the situation at Nasa Hospital because of course it's one of the last [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=69.68s)]
*  functioning hospitals in Gaza. Just tell us where it's at right now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=73.52s)]
*  Well the situation here is pretty dire because we found out on Tuesday that we are not far from the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=79.92s)]
*  active fighting zone. In fact on Tuesday the evacuation order came out and we were following [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=87.52s)]
*  it on the IDF website and we are one square away which is about four streets or a kilometre and a [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=93.28s)]
*  half and so on Tuesday we actually lost quite a few of our staff because they had to go [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=101.44s)]
*  and evacuate their families because they were living in that area of East Khan Yunus. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=106.8s)]
*  But what's really worrying for us is obviously the closer the IDF gets the more likely we are to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  have to evacuate Nasa and we are the last remaining full functioning facility in the south [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=119.12s)]
*  that has ICU capability. Although we are surrounded by some amazing field hospitals, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=127.84s)]
*  we have UK Med and ICRC and MSF Belgium not far from us and we also have the Jordanian [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=134.8s)]
*  Hospital and the Kuwait Hospital, they're all field hospitals so they're essentially tents. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=142.24s)]
*  They can't take on the complex surgery that we're doing here. They have no ICU facilities [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=147.36s)]
*  and they have no generated oxygen. Nasa at the moment has two adult ITUs, each housing 12 patients [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=155.04s)]
*  then it has an overflow ITU and then it has a pediatric ITU. So if we get evacuated no one [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=165.04s)]
*  can take those patients and if we get evacuated all of those facilities together cannot cope with [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  the number of patients that Nasa has. So we are really really concerned about the prospect of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=181.76s)]
*  lots and lots of people dying if the IDF get any closer to us. And Dr Rose does that feel because [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=189.04s)]
*  you are now very close to the active fighting area, does that now feel imminent? I mean you [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=196.88s)]
*  have said you've lost colleagues who have had to evacuate, who have lived in that area, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=204.0s)]
*  but does that now feel like any day now you could be asked to evacuate? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=208.8s)]
*  Well looking at the way that the ground offensive is being run, the plan is for the IDF to come [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=214.8s)]
*  further in from the east towards the Saladin Road and if that happens that cuts us off from Al Aqsa [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  which is the next nearest hospital to us. And it's estimated about the way that they're progressing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=229.68s)]
*  we've probably got four or five days before we're looking at being in an area that the IDF will be [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=235.68s)]
*  advancing into. Dr Rose your skills are crucial in this active war zone plastic surgeon, just talk us [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=241.44s)]
*  through the kind of scenarios and situations you've had to deal with over the course of the last week [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=251.36s)]
*  or so. Well we've had a lot of mass casualties in on this trip so we've been non-stop busy. I started [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=258.24s)]
*  at eight o'clock this morning and I was worried that I wouldn't finish in time to make the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=266.8s)]
*  interview. It's 11.30 here and I didn't get back until about quarter to 11. So it's really long [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=271.52s)]
*  days. I'm doing about 11, 11 cases a day now. They are all bomb injuries so the bulk of what [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=281.12s)]
*  we're seeing is either a burn which is probably 50% of them and those are major sort of heat burns [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=290.16s)]
*  from the explosion. Lots of them in children, half of Gaza's population is children so lots of really [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=296.88s)]
*  small children with huge burns you know all in the resuscitation level of sort of 30 to 40%. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=303.84s)]
*  Burns that are often unsurvivable in the western world and then the rest of the injuries that we're [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=311.76s)]
*  seeing are basically due to when a bomb goes off whatever is around you gets whipped up in the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=317.76s)]
*  explosion so that may be masonry bits of car whatever. That then gets ejected at quite a high [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  velocity and will hit a civilian and if it hits you in the head abdomen or chest it normally kills [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=331.52s)]
*  you. If it hits you in a limb it's possibly survivable and those are the people that are [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=340.24s)]
*  being brought to us. Some of them are already missing parts of their limbs when they get to us [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=344.88s)]
*  so hands blown off, feet blown off, feet blown off is very common injury here and they may well have [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=349.68s)]
*  other injuries, broken bones, skin loss and that's what we're dealing with. We're trying to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=356.24s)]
*  get the wounds clean enough to close and obviously this is going on for people that are living in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=361.04s)]
*  tents so the whole environment is very dirty, the wounds are very very dirty. Dr Rose, in terms of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=367.12s)]
*  you know if when this conflict ends I mean how do you see the picture of Gaza given [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  the scale of the the injuries, the death, the destruction, the casualties, everything that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=383.36s)]
*  you're talking about? Well I think we're at that critical point where we have a moment where we [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=388.32s)]
*  could change this if the war stopped now and we got aid into Gaza. The main thing at the moment [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=395.36s)]
*  is to look at the humanitarian crisis that this has created. We really need to get more food in, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=403.84s)]
*  the trucks that got in today just aren't enough. We haven't had any medical aid to us since the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=410.0s)]
*  second of March either so we're running out of all sorts of consumables. We've run out of scalpel [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=416.4s)]
*  blades, we're running out of betadine. We've also had a restriction on the number of aid workers [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=422.56s)]
*  that can get in and I think once that lifts and people can get in and start helping then we do [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  have a chance to certainly rebuild the healthcare sector here. Dr Rose we're so grateful for your [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=434.79999999999995s)]
*  time and I know you've had an incredibly long day so fitting us in right at the end to tell the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=442.56s)]
*  world what's happening is crucial. Thank you so much. Thank you. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAlZvOHQI8&t=447.36s)]
