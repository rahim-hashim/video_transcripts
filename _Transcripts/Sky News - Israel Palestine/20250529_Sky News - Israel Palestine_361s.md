Video Description: A British charity has warned that the lives of two Palestinian children are at risk unless they are evacuated from Gaza.
Pure Hope is urging Sir Keir Starmer to allow Haitham and Karam into the UK to be treated by British doctors.
Three-year-old Haitham suffered severe burns across his body after an Israel airstrike hit his home. 
And one-year-old Karam suffers from a birth defect in which nerves are missing from parts of his intestine.

*  ..to Gaza, where Hamas says it is studying American proposals [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=0.0s)]
*  for a new ceasefire. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=4.48s)]
*  President Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel agrees to the deal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=6.12s)]
*  on the table. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=10.44s)]
*  No word yet from Hamas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=12.24s)]
*  The country's media has been reporting that it includes [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=15.56s)]
*  a 60-day halt in fighting, during which nine living hostages, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=18.76s)]
*  half of the hostages known to have died also, will be released. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=23.48s)]
*  It's believed to be only a temporary agreement and comes as [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=28.8s)]
*  the suffering in the Gaza Strip continues. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  Today, an airstrike on a market in Gaza City killed at least 11 people. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  We'll have more on that in just a moment. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=42.32s)]
*  But first, our special correspondent, Alex Crawford, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=43.84s)]
*  has been speaking to those trying to help evacuate some of the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=46.160000000000004s)]
*  sickest children caught in the fighting. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=49.160000000000004s)]
*  And a warning, her report contains images of their injuries. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=52.88s)]
*  I just have to show you this little guy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=59.0s)]
*  This is my favourite little guy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=60.72s)]
*  It's tough viewing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=62.48s)]
*  Hatem's only three, covered in burns from an Israeli airstrike [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=63.72s)]
*  on his home. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=67.36s)]
*  It's a massive burn for a little guy like this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=68.28s)]
*  He's so adorable. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=70.92s)]
*  His eyelids are burned, his hands are burnt, even his feet are burnt. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=73.0s)]
*  The voice you're hearing is British surgeon Victoria Rose, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=78.32s)]
*  who's trying to save his life and many others. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=81.32s)]
*  Well, every day, there are more and more children that come in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=83.8s)]
*  to our operating theatre that have been blown up. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  So it's getting harder and harder to get him a slot in theatre [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=90.56s)]
*  to have the dressing changes he needs. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=94.28s)]
*  Hatem's family photo album shows him as a happy, healthy boy [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=96.84s)]
*  before the bombing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=100.36s)]
*  His father, who was a teacher and seen here with him, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  was killed alongside his pregnant mother. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  Hatem is the family's sole survivor. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=107.12s)]
*  His life now hangs on a thread, his condition swinging perilously [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=110.72s)]
*  from hour to hour, with Dr Rose monitoring every step. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=114.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, he hasn't been too well recently. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=118.32s)]
*  He's developed some bleeding from his intestines. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=122.44s)]
*  His guardian now and the man who's hardly left his hospital bedside [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=126.0s)]
*  is his grandfather, who gave us permission to use the pictures [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=129.48s)]
*  of his grandson. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=132.72s)]
*  He's working with a British charity who's trying to get permission [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=135.0s)]
*  to airlift Hatem and other children to safety and specialist care [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=137.8s)]
*  in Britain. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=141.56s)]
*  In more than 20 months, the UK has only taken fewer than a handful [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  of the injured from Gaza, just two children. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=145.6s)]
*  What did children do wrong to suffer such injuries, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=149.32s)]
*  to be burned and bombed? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=152.28s)]
*  We ask God to grant them healing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Look away now if you're squeamish. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=157.44s)]
*  This is one-year-old Karam, and he's the other baby identified [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=159.48s)]
*  by the British charity as needing emergency help now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=162.72s)]
*  He's suffering from hersprung disease, a birth defect, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  but easily corrected with the right skills and equipment. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  His family's fled the bombings multiple times, moving from tent [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=174.04s)]
*  to tent in conditions which make it impossible to keep infections [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=177.44s)]
*  at bay. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  No matter how much I describe how much my son is suffering, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=182.88s)]
*  I wouldn't be able to describe it enough. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  I swear, I am constantly crying. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=188.12s)]
*  Gaza's children are suffering horribly right now, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=191.0s)]
*  with local health officials saying more than 16,000 have been [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=194.12s)]
*  killed and children making up the vast bulk of their patients, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=198.32s)]
*  according to the British surgeons inside. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=201.36s)]
*  What do you say to a seven-year-old girl who's already had [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=204.4s)]
*  one limb amputated, right above the knee, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=208.32s)]
*  and now has to have her other leg amputated above the knee [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=213.8s)]
*  as well? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=217.44s)]
*  She's seven years old. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  She'll be confined most likely to a wheelchair [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=221.36s)]
*  for the rest of her life. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=224.36s)]
*  A young girl picks her way through the fire [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  after an Israeli airstrike on a school being used [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  by dozens of families as a shelter. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=231.0s)]
*  More than 30 bodies were recovered from this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=233.48s)]
*  The little girl lost her entire family, her parents [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  and siblings, and is scarred both physically and emotionally [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=240.72s)]
*  after witnessing their deaths in the inferno. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=244.48s)]
*  I saw a lot of fire, she says, a big, big fire, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  and I was scared of it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  So many children suffering so much trauma. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  The Israeli military continually justifies these bombings, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=257.12s)]
*  including this one, by saying the shelter was harboring [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  Hamas fighters without providing any evidence. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=262.96s)]
*  The British charity Project Pure Hope [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  insists there's no justification for attacks which continually [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=268.0s)]
*  see the youngest hurt and maimed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=271.52s)]
*  They've written to the prime minister and the foreign [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=275.0s)]
*  secretary to allow Britain to do its bit to help Gaza children. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=276.88s)]
*  Most of the people affected by this catastrophe [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=280.68s)]
*  that's unfolding in Gaza are children, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=284.12s)]
*  and children are the most vulnerable. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=286.4s)]
*  They have nothing to do with the politics, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=288.36s)]
*  and we really just need to see them for what they are. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=290.92s)]
*  They are children, just like my children, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=293.76s)]
*  just like everybody's children in this country, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=296.4s)]
*  and we have the ability to help them. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=298.92s)]
*  Those on the ground in Gaza say it's way past the point [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=300.8s)]
*  of taking urgent action. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=303.72s)]
*  Every time I come, I say it's really bad, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=305.52s)]
*  but this is on a completely different scale now. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=308.76s)]
*  It's mass casualties. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  It's utter carnage. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=314.8s)]
*  We are incapable of getting through this volume. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=316.56s)]
*  We don't have the personnel. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=320.68s)]
*  We don't have the medical supplies, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=323.48s)]
*  and we really don't have the facilities. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  We are the last standing hospital in the south of Gaza. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  We really are on our knees now. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=332.72s)]
*  He does. He looks really good. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=335.48s)]
*  The surgeon's skills and determination [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  are what's keeping Hatem alive right now. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=340.16s)]
*  But it'll take much more than that to save him [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=342.28s)]
*  and the thousands of other children suffering in Gaza. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR7LCYxOuGQ&t=344.71999999999997s)]
