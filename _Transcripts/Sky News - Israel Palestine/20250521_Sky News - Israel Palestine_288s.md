**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok)
*  Two Israeli embassy staff members working in Washington, DC, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=0.0s)]
*  have been shot and killed outside a Jewish museum. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=3.24s)]
*  The city's police chief confirmed that a single suspect [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=7.32s)]
*  is now in custody and that they shouted, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=9.76s)]
*  free Palestine, while being detained. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=11.76s)]
*  Prior to the shooting, the suspect was observed [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=15.4s)]
*  pacing back and forth outside of the museum. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=17.64s)]
*  He approached a group of four people, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=20.52s)]
*  produced a handgun, and opened fire, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  striking both of our decedents. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=25.64s)]
*  After the shooting, the suspect then entered the museum [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=28.479999999999997s)]
*  and was detained by event security. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=31.56s)]
*  Once in handcuffs, the suspect identified [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=34.04s)]
*  where he discarded the weapon, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=37.92s)]
*  and that weapon has been recovered, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=39.64s)]
*  and he implied that he committed the offense. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=41.72s)]
*  The suspect chanted, free, free Palestine, while in custody. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=45.08s)]
*  The suspect has been tentatively identified [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=51.099999999999994s)]
*  as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, Illinois. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  US President Donald Trump has posted on his platform, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=62.31999999999999s)]
*  Truth Social, these horrible DC killings, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=65.52s)]
*  based obviously on antisemitism, must end now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=67.64s)]
*  Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  Condonances to the families of the victims. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  So sad that such things as this can happen. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=77.16s)]
*  We've got full team coverage for you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=80.72s)]
*  Mark Stones in Washington for us. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=82.16s)]
*  Arshis Joshi's at the scene, Ali Bunker's in Jerusalem. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  Let's go to Mark first of all. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=86.12s)]
*  Mark, what do we know about the latest on this situation? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, it was just around about nine o'clock this evening [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=92.56s)]
*  in the downtown area of Washington, DC, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  outside the Jewish Museum where the shooting took place. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=99.48s)]
*  There was an event taking place there at the Jewish Museum [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=104.36s)]
*  for young diplomats, the Young Diplomats Reception 2025. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=108.12s)]
*  So we can assume that there would have been diplomats [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  and staffers there from many different embassies. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=116.32s)]
*  It was being run by the Jewish American Committee. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=119.0s)]
*  Now, the man opened fire at close range, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=122.84s)]
*  and two people were shot and pronounced dead at the scene. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=126.12s)]
*  There is added tragedy because the Israeli ambassador [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=131.4s)]
*  who was at a news conference, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=135.48s)]
*  a late night news conference a couple of hours ago, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=136.76s)]
*  has revealed that the two victims were a couple [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=139.72s)]
*  and that they were due to travel to Jerusalem [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=143.36s)]
*  this coming week to get engaged. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=146.44s)]
*  So a deeply personal tragedy there. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=148.76s)]
*  I've been in touch with sources [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=152.16s)]
*  at the Israeli embassy this evening, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=154.44s)]
*  and I can tell you the whole embassy [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=156.44s)]
*  is in a deep, deep sense of shock this morning [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=158.2s)]
*  as they absorb this news. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=162.24s)]
*  You also get the sense of just how seriously, naturally, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  the Trump administration is taking this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  Not only has he tweeted about it very, very quickly [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=171.08s)]
*  or posted on social media, but Pam Bondi, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=173.52s)]
*  his attorney general, the federal attorney general, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=176.32s)]
*  was at the news conference, the midnight news conference, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=179.12s)]
*  alongside the mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=183.0s)]
*  and the police chief, who gave quite a bit of detail. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=187.6s)]
*  The man is in custody and is clearly being questioned. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=190.76s)]
*  They clearly have a sense of his motivation, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=194.48s)]
*  and pro-Palestine, anti-Israel protests have gathered steam [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=198.8s)]
*  over the course of the past 18 months or so. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=205.0s)]
*  Protests, peaceful protests on college campuses, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=209.52s)]
*  but also more violent acts as well. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=212.84s)]
*  It was a few months ago that we saw a man set himself on fire [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=215.76s)]
*  outside the Israeli embassy here in Washington, D.C. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=219.92s)]
*  That's a protest of what he was watching unfold in Gaza. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  But this is a very serious incident. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=228.72s)]
*  You know, Wilf, there are shootings most nights [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=231.48s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  Very rarely do they involve foreign embassy staffers. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  And of course, the challenge now will be to question this man [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  and understand precisely what his motivations were, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  whether he was acting alone. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  There is some suggestion that he moved into the museum, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=249.88s)]
*  questions about whether he wanted to continue his attack. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  Mark, great stuff. Thanks so much for that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=258.2s)]
*  Let's listen to a sound bite before we get out to Ashish [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=259.88s)]
*  of the ambassador there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  We are a resilient people. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=266.44s)]
*  The people of Israel are resilient people, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=269.64s)]
*  and the people of the United States of America [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=272.0s)]
*  are resilient people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=274.24s)]
*  Together we won't be afraid, together we'll stand, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=276.4s)]
*  and we're going to overcome moral depravity of people [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=279.8s)]
*  who think that they're going to achieve political gains [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=284.12s)]
*  through murder. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2RfZCgC3Ok&t=287.16s)]
