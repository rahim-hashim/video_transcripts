# Washington attack: I gave the suspect water 'unbeknownst to me that I was looking evil in the eye'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs)
*  I believe unknowingly spoke to the suspect. Is that correct, Jojo? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have your facts correct. At the time when he entered the building, we were experiencing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=6.24s)]
*  things in real time as they were unfolding. And so the security guard who let him in, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=14.88s)]
*  it was her impression, the event was wrapping up, it was her impression that he was a victim, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=19.44s)]
*  an innocent bystander to this attack. And being the well-meaning group that we are, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=23.76s)]
*  we all thought that was the case. And I actually offered him, gave him water. Unbeknownst to me [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=28.32s)]
*  that I was looking evil in the eye and that he was the murderer who killed these two. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=36.08s)]
*  Sarah and Yaron, may their memory be a blessing and my heart and condolences goes out to their [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=43.04s)]
*  family. Wow, so sorry, that was after the killing. If you don't mind, Jojo? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=47.2s)]
*  So, I was just going to say, take us back if you don't mind. And I understand if you'd rather not, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=55.2s)]
*  please just say so to the moment it all unfolded. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  So, sorry, this event was like annual young diplomats event, which I served on the AJC [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=67.76s)]
*  Young Professional Board. And we picked a theme this year of turning pain into purpose. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=74.16s)]
*  It was actually focused on bringing young professionals, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=80.08s)]
*  30 different embassies were represented, some representatives from the State Department. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  And essentially, we were gathered to talk about bridge building and a coalition of organizations [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=90.08s)]
*  and for the MENA region. So, that's the Middle East and North African region, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=98.56s)]
*  who are working together. Trust is a rare commodity in the Middle East, and they have formed trust [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=102.8s)]
*  across various regions and backgrounds to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. And that is, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=107.52s)]
*  these organizations are speaking off the record, but we were hearing from them directly. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  So, it's painfully ironic that at a time when we were building, speaking about [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=117.28s)]
*  bridge building, that someone came in with such hate and destruction. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  We were wanting to counter the us versus them narrative and come together in humanity and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=127.36s)]
*  shared humanity. So, I actually myself, the event was popping up, I made my way to the third floor, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=131.76s)]
*  on my way down is when the shooting occurred. I did not hear the shots. And when I arrived in the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=137.52s)]
*  lobby, there was commotion and a frenzy. But at that time, we were not, no one was aware of lives [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=142.96s)]
*  lost. The gunshots were heard, so security started locking the doors. And that is when I saw whom I [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=148.96s)]
*  now know is the perpetrator, the murderer of these Miss Israeli Jewish couple. And [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=156.56s)]
*  I didn't find out till much later, but he was actually the murderer. So, I see him, he seems very [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=164.88s)]
*  distraught. I now understand it's because he killed two people's point blank, offered him water. He [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=171.68s)]
*  accepted. I then handed him the water and apologies for my husband walking behind the screen. And then [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=177.44s)]
*  he seconds after I've handed him the water, he whips out his kaffir and yells, free Palestine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  And then he's subdued by the officers on scene. I can't recall if that was DC police or [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=190.24s)]
*  museum security. And at that point, we still hadn't connected the dots. We thought maybe he [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=197.28s)]
*  shot the gun to just get into the museum. It wasn't till later, we were finding out in real [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=201.92s)]
*  time from the news media as we were being sequestered to be interviewed by detectives, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=206.8s)]
*  that two people were killed and then later found out whom they were, what embassy they worked for. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  And I just feel so, my heart just goes out again to these victims' families and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=216.72s)]
*  yeah, I'm going to walk forwards. Did you know Sarah and Yaron? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=228.4s)]
*  No, I did not personally know them and I didn't speak to them at this evening's event. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=235.28s)]
*  But I have heard from my friend who's an editor at Jewish Insider that they were due to be aged, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=240.0s)]
*  she had just purchased a ring. They were going to get engaged in Jerusalem. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  One couple in a pest of love and building a life and bridging two families together [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=255.52s)]
*  and such destruction has just not only destroyed their lives but all of their family [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=262.32s)]
*  mother's lives. And it must have shocked and deeply affected all those in attendance at this [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  event that you organized tonight and you as well. Yeah, we're definitely all still processing and I [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=277.2s)]
*  think that what motivates me to come and share my testimony and speak as a witness to this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=283.84s)]
*  unspeakable, unfathomable targeted Jew hate and hate crime and active anti-Semitism is that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=292.0s)]
*  if those of us who experienced this event can continue to find our humanity, this event was, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=300.23999999999995s)]
*  we were gathering in the name of humanity and in the name of bridge building and turning pain into [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=307.28s)]
*  purpose. And I just want to continue to amplify those themes and that he's not representative of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=312.16s)]
*  every single Palestinian and Palestinians and Israelis alike deserve self-determination, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=319.04s)]
*  deserve building peace, diaspora Jews deserve to be able to gather and non-Jews alike peacefully [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  at a Jewish museum. And the fact that I've, it's just unfathomable, I still haven't think I've [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=329.36s)]
*  fully embodied what I experienced this evening, but regardless of what I experienced, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=336.96s)]
*  two people have lost their lives and their families are just getting the news. And [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=342.4s)]
*  that's what I want to continue to echo is two people murdered and in cold blood execution style. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's unspeakable, unthinkable and at the end also just so deeply ironic that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=355.12s)]
*  we were discussing humanitarian aid into Gaza. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=362.16s)]
*  Of all things, we were working to counter the us versus them narrative. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=367.6s)]
*  And so, go ahead. Does it make you reticent to gather again, for example, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=372.8s)]
*  at a Jewish museum for an event like this or not? I don't want to let the terrorists win and I don't [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=381.76s)]
*  want to let sociopaths or psychopaths, I don't want to be an armchair psychiatrist here, but [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=388.24s)]
*  clearly anyone who has that capacity to kill is deeply, deeply unwell. I will say [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=393.52s)]
*  my thought ironically wasn't, oh, guns are fired. We're at a very Jewish event at a very Jewish [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=401.44s)]
*  venue sponsored by a very Jewish organization. I didn't immediately think, oh, this is a hate crime. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=408.8s)]
*  I was like, DC violence. And so, I think I will be more hyper vigilant, but I will not be deterred [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=413.68s)]
*  to gather in Jewish spaces, but I will ask more questions around security. And I know that they [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=420.72s)]
*  recently received a grant, the Capital Jewish Museum did to up their security and this is exactly [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=426.8s)]
*  why. And it's a sad world we live in that we can't just gather peacefully Jews, non-Jews alike in a [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  Jewish space without being under the threat of death and violence. But no, I won't be deterred. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=440.08s)]
*  I'll just be more hyper vigilant. And being too deterred would just be letting terrorists win and [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  we're not going to let hate win. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1nGwlZQSs&t=452.64s)]
