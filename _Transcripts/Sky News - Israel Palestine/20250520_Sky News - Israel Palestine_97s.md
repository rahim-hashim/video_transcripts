Video Description: Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he and the leaders of Canada and France are "horrified" by Israel's new offensive in Gaza - and the level of aid being allowed into Gaza.

Addressing parliament, he said a ceasefire was the only way of releasing the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.

"I want to put on record today that we're horrified by the escalation from Israel," he said.

He said the announcement that a "basic quantity" of food would be allowed into Gaza by Israel as "totally and utterly inadequate".

# 'Totally and utterly inadequate': Starmer says world 'cannot allow Gaza to starve'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE)
*  Thank you Mr Speaker. With permission I'd like to update the House on the three recent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE&t=0.0s)]
*  trade deals we've struck in the national interest. But first Mr Speaker I'd like to say something [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE&t=6.24s)]
*  about the horrific situation in Gaza where the level of suffering, innocent children [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE&t=13.24s)]
*  being bombed again, is utterly intolerable. Mr Speaker over the weekend we coordinated [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE&t=19.66s)]
*  a response with our allies as set out in my statement with President Macron and Prime [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE&t=27.36s)]
*  Minister Carney last night. And I want to put on record today that we're horrified by the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE&t=33.28s)]
*  escalation from Israel. We repeat our demand for a ceasefire as the only way to free the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE&t=40.64s)]
*  hostages. We repeat our opposition to settlements in the West Bank. And we repeat our demand [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  to massively scale up humanitarian assistance into Gaza. The recent announcement that Israel [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE&t=55.64s)]
*  will allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza, a basic quantity, is totally and utterly inadequate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  So we must coordinate our response because this war has gone on for far too long. We [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve and the Foreign Secretary will come to the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE&t=79.4s)]
*  House shortly to set out our response. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQNEnyGaELE&t=83.68s)]
