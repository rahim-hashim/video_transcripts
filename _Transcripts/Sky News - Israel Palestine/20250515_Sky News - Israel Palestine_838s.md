# Sky News' Yalda Hakim challenges Israeli envoy over IDF strike information
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg)
*  And my next guest, Danon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador Danon, thank you very much for joining us here on the program. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=4.2s)]
*  I just want to begin by playing you these words from the UN's humanitarian chief, Tom [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=7.68s)]
*  Fletcher. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=12.44s)]
*  Let's just have a listen. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=13.44s)]
*  We have briefed this council in great detail on the extensive civilian harm that we witness [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=14.44s)]
*  daily. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Death, injury, destruction, hunger, disease, torture, other cruel, inhuman or degrading [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=22.319999999999997s)]
*  treatment, repeated displacement on a large scale. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  We have described the deliberate obstruction of aid operations and the systematic dismantling [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=34.76s)]
*  of Palestinian life and that which sustains it in Gaza. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  This degradation of international law is corrosive and infectious. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=44.06s)]
*  It is undermining decades of progress on rules to protect civilians from inhumanity [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=49.26s)]
*  and the violent and lawless among us who act with impunity. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=54.78s)]
*  That was Tom Fletcher. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=62.94s)]
*  Ambassador Danon, he goes on to say, stop the 21st century atrocity in Gaza. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  Will you act now decisively to prevent genocide in Gaza and to ensure respect for international [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=70.18s)]
*  humanitarian law? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=75.78s)]
*  I just want to get your reaction to what Tom Fletcher was saying. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=77.42s)]
*  Yalda, I was there yesterday at the Security Council and I heard Mr. Fletcher and I told [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=80.42s)]
*  him very directly, we are in this war because of Hamas period. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=86.98s)]
*  If you want to blame somebody, blame Hamas for all the suffering both in Israel and in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=92.02000000000001s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  This war will not end while we have hostages in Gaza. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  We are not going to leave behind 58 hostages and move on. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  The sooner the world will understand that, maybe we can move forward for something else. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=107.86s)]
*  But expecting Israel to decide that that's it, we forget about the hostages, it's just [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=112.5s)]
*  not going to happen. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=117.5s)]
*  We will continue this war until Hamas is defeated and last hostages back home. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=118.94s)]
*  Ambassador Danon, I'm not talking about Hamas, a terrorist organization. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=126.74s)]
*  I am talking about you, the state of Israel, as a responsible actor for the last 19 months. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=132.02s)]
*  The world has been watching the way that you have prosecuted this conflict, the way that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=138.94s)]
*  aid has been prevented from reaching the most needy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=143.46s)]
*  In the last two months, 73 days, we have seen that there has been no aid that has entered [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=154.9s)]
*  So while you can deflect and say that this is Hamas's responsibility, at the end of the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=155.9s)]
*  day, you are the governing power in Gaza, you have a responsibility to ensure that there [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=161.1s)]
*  is no famine and starvation in Gaza, which is what the world, including your allies and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=166.58s)]
*  partners, are now accusing you of. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  And it's gone beyond accusation. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=174.06s)]
*  They are saying that they are seeing it in real time take place. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=175.82s)]
*  The only starvation in Gaza is the starvation of the hostages. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=181.18s)]
*  We have heard the testimony of Yidan Alexander who came out two days ago about the way he [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=184.74s)]
*  was treated in a cage chained by his feet and hands, starving to death. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=188.98s)]
*  So the only starvation is of the hostages. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=195.17999999999998s)]
*  And it's very simple. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=197.73999999999998s)]
*  You know, you can go on and on and blame Israel for everything. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=198.73999999999998s)]
*  But you have to make it very simple. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=202.38s)]
*  As long as we have hostages in Gaza, we will not stop. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  We will bring them back home. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  They will be abducted from Israel and then we come back to Israel. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=210.38s)]
*  Ambassador Danon, I just want to show this Kogat graph from the last few months. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=216.14000000000001s)]
*  It stops at the end of February. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=222.06s)]
*  We'll just get it up on our screen where you can see there is now no record of any aid [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=224.54s)]
*  entering Gaza. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=230.26s)]
*  Humanitarians across the globe are saying that Israel continues to deny them access [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=232.78s)]
*  into Gaza and continues to deny any aid into Gaza, including Cindy McCain, the chief of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=237.44s)]
*  the World Food Programme. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=245.06s)]
*  Just your reaction and response to that, because we can talk about the hostages in a moment [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=246.70000000000002s)]
*  and we can talk about Hamas's actions. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=251.26000000000002s)]
*  But I am asking you about the aid and the fact that you are the governing body in Gaza [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  and there is now no food for people in the Strip. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=259.72s)]
*  First of all, I beg to differ with your assessments. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=263.5s)]
*  You know, yesterday I showed that the Security Council, that the IPC report, they that in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  Gaza they are facing famine in the future. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=274.46s)]
*  There is enough food because during the ceasefire we allowed tons of supply to come into Gaza. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=276.82s)]
*  But I am not telling you that it's easy to be in Gaza. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=283.62s)]
*  But if you want to blame somebody, blame Hamas. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=286.14s)]
*  It's very easy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=288.5s)]
*  They just need to release the hostages, lay the weapons and then it's over. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=289.5s)]
*  But expecting us now to listen to the cries of the people of Gaza and close our ears for [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=294.34s)]
*  the cries of the hostages and their families, it will not happen. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=300.14s)]
*  We hear the families and we are with you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=304.06s)]
*  Is your conflict though, I mean you are saying you are not going to focus on the cries of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=307.54s)]
*  the people in Gaza. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=314.62s)]
*  But are you now saying that you admit that it's not your responsibility to ensure that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=316.42s)]
*  aid gets into Gaza, that people like Tom Fletcher, Cindy McCain, leading global humanitarians [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=322.1s)]
*  is no aid getting into the strip and Israel is not allowing it, that it doesn't matter [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=329.4s)]
*  what they think, you are going to continue to prosecute your war. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  That is the policy of Israel now? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=338.64s)]
*  Well, unfortunately you have a few players who like to speak a lot about humanitarian [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=340.67999999999995s)]
*  issues in Gaza. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=346.28s)]
*  But if you allow me for one minute, the US has put out a plan to support Gaza with humanitarian [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=347.28s)]
*  help. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=354.0s)]
*  Even before the plan was presented, it was denied by the UN and some agencies. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=355.6s)]
*  I'm happy that there are NGOs who will cooperate with that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=361.88s)]
*  But I ask myself, if they claim that there is a problem, why don't they engage with the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  US about their plan, about their ideas to provide humanitarian aid into Gaza? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  And immediately they said we will not cooperate with that, we will not take part of that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=375.36s)]
*  That's hypocrisy. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  That is hypocrisy. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=380.92s)]
*  As you say, they have rejected that because for the last 19 months Israel continues to [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=384.96s)]
*  be accused of preventing aid trucks from entering the strip. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=390.03999999999996s)]
*  I just want to ask you about a number of other things, including systematic human rights [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=394.28s)]
*  abuses that we have been seeing in Gaza. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=399.28s)]
*  Sky News did an investigation about a number of paramedics who were killed and then buried [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  in shallow land in Gaza alongside their vehicles. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=409.36s)]
*  Israel's own internal investigation, despite repeated claims that these were Hamas militants, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=417.12s)]
*  it was discovered that these were in fact paramedics. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  Your response to that? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=425.68s)]
*  Well, first I would be very happy to see when the next Sky report about human rights abuse [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=426.68s)]
*  of Hamas in Gaza. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=432.04s)]
*  Every day they execute their own people. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=434.36s)]
*  I'm asking about Israel's responsibility here. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=439.44s)]
*  We can talk about Hamas and we are conducting an interview with Hamas tomorrow and we will [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=446.2s)]
*  hold Hamas accountable. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=450.88s)]
*  I want to ask about these paramedics, these 15 paramedics who were not Hamas militants [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  and we have continued to see the targeting of hospitals and the targeting of paramedics [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=462.55999999999995s)]
*  by Israel who is supposed to be a responsible state actor. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=468.88s)]
*  So comparing yourself to Hamas, who as you say operates as a terrorist organization, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=473.79999999999995s)]
*  when you are supposed to be a democratic state, a responsible actor, you are not the same [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=480.67999999999995s)]
*  as Hamas and you shouldn't compare yourself to Hamas. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=487.4s)]
*  I'm asking for your reaction and response to the killing of these 15 paramedics. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=490.36s)]
*  Well I will answer that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=495.92s)]
*  I wasn't comparing Israel. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=496.92s)]
*  I would just say it's about time that Sky News will do a report about what Hamas is [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=497.92s)]
*  doing to the people in Gaza. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  Now regarding your question, I can tell you that we are doing our best to minimize civilian [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=503.92s)]
*  casualties but when Hamas is hiding in hospitals, when Hamas is using those NGOs as human shields, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=510.44s)]
*  that's unfortunate. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=518.44s)]
*  And if we make a mistake, and sometimes we do make mistakes, we take responsibility for [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=519.44s)]
*  that and we acknowledge that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=524.6400000000001s)]
*  But we are doing everything we can to minimize casualties of people who are not involved [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=526.9200000000001s)]
*  with terrorist organizations. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=531.6s)]
*  But let's acknowledge it. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=533.6400000000001s)]
*  You know only yesterday we heard a report about attack of Hamas leadership in Gaza. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=534.8800000000001s)]
*  Why they were hiding in a hospital? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=540.7600000000001s)]
*  Why they were hiding in a tunnel beneath a hospital? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=542.72s)]
*  And I want to get to that incident that took place yesterday. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=547.16s)]
*  But with this particular incident with the paramedics, it wasn't until footage emerged, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=550.4s)]
*  Israel continued to deny that these were innocent paramedics. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=557.04s)]
*  You said that they were in fact Hamas militants. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=560.9599999999999s)]
*  It wasn't until footage emerged that Israel then said it would conduct an internal investigation [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=564.0799999999999s)]
*  and the findings of that investigation has not concluded that these were Hamas militants. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=570.04s)]
*  Even though the paramedics say they alerted the IDF of who they were. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=576.08s)]
*  In terms of yesterday's attack, I just want to show you some footage that was released [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=580.24s)]
*  by the IDF. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=583.72s)]
*  Israeli forces say that they were targeting, as you say, a Hamas command and control center [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=585.36s)]
*  buried underneath the European hospital. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=590.48s)]
*  You can see what the IDF says are tunnels outlined there in red. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=593.1600000000001s)]
*  And this is footage, Ambassador, that the IDF itself has put out. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=599.14s)]
*  Now, Sky News has confirmed the footage actually shows the Isan al-Agh school, which is about [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=604.32s)]
*  160 meters away. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=610.44s)]
*  So this is the courtyard of a school and not in fact the command and control center of [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=612.5200000000001s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=619.32s)]
*  So, you know, because you sent me that information, I checked it with our people on the ground. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=620.32s)]
*  And what we found out that in this case, yes, you had infrastructure of tunnels beneath [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=626.32s)]
*  the hospital, but it wasn't only beneath the hospital. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=631.5600000000001s)]
*  It was stretched to other areas in that region. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=634.9200000000001s)]
*  And that's why, you know, it wasn't only under the hospital. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=638.0s)]
*  But you should ask yourself, why under almost every hospital in Gaza, you have a command [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=640.9200000000001s)]
*  center of Hamas? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=645.64s)]
*  You know, and that's the question we should ask our... [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=647.08s)]
*  Sir, I just want to tell you what our experts have told us. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=650.6800000000001s)]
*  Those tunnels that you're talking about, the dark shapes highlighted there on the screen, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=654.72s)]
*  the markings were caused by water, not tunnels, because these are drainage systems. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=660.1999999999999s)]
*  And so the dark shades that you're talking about, which Israel claims to be tunnels, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=665.6s)]
*  are in fact caused by water because of a drainage system. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=670.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm not familiar with your experts, but I can tell you that, Yilda, that today [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=675.0s)]
*  in Gaza, you have underground system bigger than the tube in London and the subway in [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=680.7199999999999s)]
*  New York City combined. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=685.72s)]
*  It's a huge infrastructure of tunnels. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=687.6s)]
*  All the dollars that were spent over the years in Gaza went to the tunnels. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=690.2s)]
*  And that's unfortunate. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=694.9200000000001s)]
*  And we are determined it will not be that case. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=695.9200000000001s)]
*  The future of Gaza will be without Hamas, without tunnels, and hopefully the money will [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=698.64s)]
*  be invested in building hospitals and schools and not network of tunnels. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=703.72s)]
*  Ambassador, sir, can I confirm that the video that the IDF has put out to say it was the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=709.0s)]
*  European hospital and that there was a tunnel system under there was in fact wrong? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=715.52s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=719.96s)]
*  I told you earlier, we checked it and we saw tunnels that started in the hospital and went [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=720.96s)]
*  to other areas in the surrounding area of the hospital. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=727.68s)]
*  Our experts say that this is in fact the courtyard of a school and not a command and control [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  centre. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=738.88s)]
*  And like I said, those tunnels that you point to are in fact the dark marks were caused [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=739.88s)]
*  by water because of a drainage system. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=743.84s)]
*  So would you say then and admit that this was in fact a mistake by the IDF? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=746.08s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=752.84s)]
*  And I think we would be able to confirm some of the individuals who were able to eliminate [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=753.84s)]
*  in this operation. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=760.6800000000001s)]
*  And you ask yourself, it was like a school, why you have leaders of Hamas terrorist organisation [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  hiding beneath a school, beneath a hospital. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=768.4200000000001s)]
*  They're taking advantage of those places but we are determined to hunt them down everywhere. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=771.48s)]
*  I'm sorry, you're not answering my question. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=776.6800000000001s)]
*  The footage put out by the IDF, they claimed that it was the tunnel and command and control [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=780.32s)]
*  centre underneath the European hospital. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=785.4s)]
*  The footage in fact is of a school. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=787.8000000000001s)]
*  Did the IDF put out the wrong footage or they got it wrong? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=790.16s)]
*  So I answered you, maybe you are not happy with the answer I'm giving you, but it wasn't [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=793.36s)]
*  only the hospital itself. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=798.0s)]
*  The surrounding of the hospital, you have other infrastructure of Hamas, you have tunnels [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=800.08s)]
*  connecting those infrastructure into the hospital and it's not the first time that we see that [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=806.24s)]
*  the hospital itself is the headquarters and in facilities around the hospital you have [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=811.64s)]
*  command centres of Hamas. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=817.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay, Ambassador Danil, we'll have to leave it there. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=820.0s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us here on the programme. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=824.8000000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dcUzbHcMg&t=826.72s)]
