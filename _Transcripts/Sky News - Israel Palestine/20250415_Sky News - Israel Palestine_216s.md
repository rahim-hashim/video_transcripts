Video Description: Fighting in Gaza is ongoing after efforts to move to the second phase of the ceasefire collapsed. 

Israel has continued its strikes on the enclave and the hostages held by the likes of Hamas are yet to be returned.

Sky News' Diana Magnay spoke to one man called, Salah Jundia in Shujaiyya, just east of Gaza City who was forced to abandon loved ones trapped beneath rubble.

The IDF say they are "investigating the circumstances around the Jundia family" as a result of our enquiries. In relation to the access of heavy equipment into the Strip, they say they work closely with international aid organisations to enable the delivery of humanitarian activities in accordance with international law.

# Gaza residents struggle to find bodies under rubble | Israel-Hamas war
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU)
*  You may have grown used to the terrible images from Gaza now, the chaos just after a strike. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=0.0s)]
*  The desperately injured, so many of them children. The death tolls relentless climb now Israel [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  is bombing again. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=15.76s)]
*  But think of those you cannot see who die slowly, trapped in the rubble. Imagine the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=21.68s)]
*  screams which grow fainter each day. The phones ringing till the battery runs down. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=26.82s)]
*  Because the rescue kit they have here is so basic. How can a sledgehammer smash through [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=37.3s)]
*  huge slabs of concrete? These images all from the last two weeks in Shijaya, east of Gaza [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=42.18s)]
*  City. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=48.94s)]
*  A father and his daughters, five people are down there they're saying, beneath what was [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=50.94s)]
*  the ceiling of their home. The rescue workers incredibly frustrated by the inadequacy of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=56.62s)]
*  their kit. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=62.379999999999995s)]
*  There is a child there and this is the equipment we are using. It's so basic, a trowel, a [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=66.53999999999999s)]
*  rope, a hammer. This is what we are using. These things need heavy machinery. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=73.14s)]
*  But Israel won't let in heavy machinery like diggers or bulldozers, not during the ceasefire [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=80.84s)]
*  to clear away the rubble and not now that the bombing has resumed. So at best they have [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  these drills and not much power to run them. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=91.78s)]
*  Two weeks ago Salah Jundia made this desperate appeal to save 15 of his extended family trapped [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=101.7s)]
*  beneath the rubble after a strike in Shijaya. Three adults and 12 children. He says the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=107.42s)]
*  last phone call from beneath the rubble came three days after the strike. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=114.5s)]
*  The line was open for 25 seconds then it went dead. We don't know what happened. We tried [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=123.14s)]
*  to call but there was no answer. There were men from the area who said they could hear [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=128.26s)]
*  people calling and young children crying. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=135.06s)]
*  So many family members gone. Some they managed to pull out and bury immediately after they [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=141.38s)]
*  were hit. 15 more who they assume must now be dead. Rescuers tried to get there but said [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=148.54s)]
*  that Israeli military were in the area and it was impossible to come near. A family friend [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=154.54s)]
*  went again last week but came under fire and was killed. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=159.45999999999998s)]
*  The IDF say they are investigating the circumstances around the Jundia family as a result of our [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=164.38s)]
*  enquiries. In relation to the access of heavy equipment into this trip they say they work [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=169.94s)]
*  closely with international aid organisations to enable the delivery of humanitarian activities [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  in accordance with international law. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=182.1s)]
*  And all the while the evacuation orders continue. The scramble to move again and who knows where. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=187.42s)]
*  22 times this displacement. The situation is bad and we suffering a lot. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=194.42s)]
*  Shajaya, Rafa, Khan Yunus. So many on the move. So many left behind. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm1ZVBsXiUU&t=203.42s)]
