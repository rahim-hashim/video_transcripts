# Palestinian ambassador reacts to Israel's plans to occupy all of Gaza
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4)
*  What is your reaction to the story? This was the plan from the beginning. First of all, we have a plan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=0.0s)]
*  Supported by the Arab world after the summit supported by the majority [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=6.76s)]
*  The vast majority of the international community including including the UK the plan goes like this. We need to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=11.76s)]
*  Uphold the ceasefire [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=19.28s)]
*  It was a US mediated ceasefire that would have seen all hostages released if Israel was after their own hostages [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=20.56s)]
*  They would have been home by now [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=27.72s)]
*  That would see the unhindered access to humanitarian aid under the supervision of us the Palestinian government and international [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=29.72s)]
*  organizations and it would see the massive rebuilding and reconstruction of Gaza and the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=38.28s)]
*  reunification of Gaza with the West Bank under the Palestinian government that Hamas has no role in governance and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Everybody agreed on that and we will move swiftly together with our international regional and international partners [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=49.16s)]
*  You're aware of the Saudi French initiative next month in the UN in New York to bring the world together to actually [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=56.12s)]
*  visit the root cause of all this and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=63.08s)]
*  Resolve this conflict once and for all on the basis of the international consensus and international [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=65.44s)]
*  Resolutions that recognition of the state of Palestine is required. You may have heard the French the French president and many others [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  So we that's our plan [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=77.08s)]
*  However, Israel that any hour has another plan and it's clear the plan has nothing to do with hostages [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=79.12s)]
*  Actually Israel is targeting their own hostages. The plan is not targeting Hamas. The plan is targeting the Palestinian people [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=86.08s)]
*  Depopulating Gaza reoccupying Gaza and guess what? Well, it's happening also in the West Bank [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  You are aware what is happening in Geneva until current depopulating tens of thousands of people destroying [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=97.84s)]
*  Refugee camps infrastructure. So this is the plan and the question is how on earth [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=104.08s)]
*  Can Israel advance its plan up against the rest of the world? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=108.84s)]
*  Well, there's a lot to get to there but but let's pick up on your final point first of all because [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=113.32s)]
*  Yesterday the Prime Minister [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=119.8s)]
*  Spoke to the president of France president Macron a spokesperson said they had deep concern at the recent developments [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=121.64s)]
*  And that they agreed a renewed peace process was required [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=128.72s)]
*  Is that enough? I mean you asked the question [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=133.28s)]
*  How can they proceed if the international community is against it is the international community is prime minister? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  Stalmer doing enough in your eyes much more is needed. Absolutely. We've just concluded a visit by my prime minister and there were a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=141.76s)]
*  lot of conversations about this about moving in a different direction about the need of the international community including the UK to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  enforce international law rather than call [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  For it. So if you want to enforce this stop calling and asking Israel to abide by international law [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=160.72s)]
*  Enforce it and this requires sanctions on the illegal practices including the settlements and the settlers this requires arms embargo [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=167.84s)]
*  this requires accountability against all war criminals and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  Respecting the independence of the international criminal court and this it was the recognition of the state of Palestine [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=180.56s)]
*  If you want that anyhow to listen take action [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=186.88s)]
*  Do you think that this plan as was announced and and we'll have to see exactly how it manifests [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  Comes with the explicit approval or implicit approval of President Trump [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=195.52s)]
*  And is that really what matters here as much as you might like to see more from Prime Minister Stalmer? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=201.68s)]
*  well, we know that Netanyahu will not be able to do what he's doing without the support of the US and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=206.4s)]
*  Remember when President Trump and his team asked Netanyahu to stop in January [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=212.28s)]
*  They did stop immediately as his fire was achieved and we saw the beginning of exchanging hostages [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=217.12s)]
*  We saw the beginning of resolving the situation [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=223.56s)]
*  So yes, there is a responsibility on the US being the closest and the biggest supporter of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=227.0s)]
*  Israel and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=234.44s)]
*  Netanyahu and here is the conversation and the discussion about the rest of the world the UK France and the rest of the international [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=236.28s)]
*  Community we cannot leave this at the whim of two individuals [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  We have to create a momentum in a different direction. Otherwise what happens in Gaza will not stay in Gaza [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=246.36s)]
*  Wolf it will not stay in Gaza. This is very dangerous the use of starvation as a method of war [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=253.64s)]
*  You know Gaza now is officially in famine. The last was a girl a baby girl [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=259.4s)]
*  Janine Scaffi she was only months old. She succumbed on Saturday because of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=264.44s)]
*  Manutrition she is number [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=270.8s)]
*  57 to die of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=272.84s)]
*  Starvation we are on the 21st century to starve an entire population [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=275.38s)]
*  Displace an entire population and announce it that this is your policy and now you want to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  Depopulate again to the south and reoccupy Gaza. So there is no conversation here [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  We need to create an opposite force [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  sorry, we have to create an opposite force to this force of complete and at a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  Zero-sum game by Netanyahu and his coalition. I want to talk about the humanity humanitarian situation in just in just a moment [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=297.92s)]
*  But I guess to come back to to one of if not the key causes for where we are [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=303.84s)]
*  And it's a question. I feel like we've asked so many times and I forgive me for asking it again, but you must [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=310.96s)]
*  Regret that all of the hostages have not been released [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  Would that change things I would have one day of course from day one [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=320.67999999999995s)]
*  We all wanted the hostages to be released. We always say that we also [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  Palestinians are hostages to Israeli system of oppression. We have thousands wolf [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=329.24s)]
*  We have more than 15,000 now being rounded mostly without charge without trial [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  Some of them are children. So we wanted that to happen and it started to happen [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=338.6s)]
*  since the ceasefire agreement in in January, but [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=343.36s)]
*  Netanyahu is not interested in the hostages ask the families of the hostages [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  He is interested in this moment of time to advance his [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  Ideological agenda together with Bingvi and Smotrich that agenda believes in one thing [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=356.2s)]
*  There is no place for the Palestinian people. They must be annihilated [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=361.68s)]
*  exterminated by the use of food by the use of medicine by the use of [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=365.88s)]
*  Direct murder and look at the numbers [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=370.32s)]
*  This is and not just in Gaza. It's all over whatever Palestinians are [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=372.8s)]
*  So this is this is rather all these pretexts all these pretexts about this and that release the hostages you think you think [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=377.08s)]
*  Israel seriously just interested in that. I mean it doesn't add up [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=385.54s)]
*  It does not add up of course that that is not Netanyahu's stated aim and they would deny [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=389.1s)]
*  Some some of the framings there that you've mentioned and tell us the situation at the moment on the ground that the humanitarian situation [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=395.94s)]
*  It's a pork apocalyptic up. You know what? It's post apocalyptic [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=404.5s)]
*  It's it's it's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=409.18s)]
*  People and I am from Gaza. I speak to my family and I speak to my friends. I'm from Rafa [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=411.18s)]
*  I was born in Rafa Rafa is completely annihilated to tell you destroyed demolished [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=416.86s)]
*  Like I have seen images of Rafa aerial images. This is the city I grew up in I [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=422.22s)]
*  Dread the day I go back. I could not realize or relate to any of the streets that I used to this is this is [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=429.02s)]
*  Unimaginable that an entire population will go through this for this long [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=436.86s)]
*  Well for this long [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=442.02000000000004s)]
*  19 months total besiegement denial of entry of basic needs [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=443.94s)]
*  Forcing them to be displaced 1.9 million of the 2.3 million are now displaced not only once or twice [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=450.1s)]
*  More than 10 times and Netanyahu now and the government asked them to be displaced again [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=458.18s)]
*  And then you know the bombardment the carpet bombing on a daily basis and now people have no access to food [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=462.74s)]
*  No access to hospitals. This is not only apocalyptic [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=470.42s)]
*  But the most important question how this will affect the rest of us and the world how this will affect our international system [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=474.78000000000003s)]
*  How this will affect the next the next war? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=483.1s)]
*  Mongers how the normalization of starving children the normalization of targeting ambulances the normalization of besieging an entire [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=486.86s)]
*  Population will be received by other quarters and other criminals. This is the big challenge facing us [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=494.42s)]
*  This will be much beyond Gaza in my opinion ambassador. Thank you for joining us this morning [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=500.38000000000005s)]
*  We appreciate it and we did invite the Israeli government on as well [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=504.42s)]
*  To speak today, but not yet joining us [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=510.38000000000005s)]
*  You [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGprahaejJ4&t=516.22s)]
