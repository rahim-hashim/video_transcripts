# Tributes paid to Israel embassy staff shot dead in Washington DC
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg)
*  There are layers to the anguish, the anger and the shock of what happened here overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=0.0s)]
*  Through the morning the crime scene became a focal point for a community to pause and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=12.4s)]
*  reflect. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=16.92s)]
*  There's no doubt, there is fear. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=17.92s)]
*  The young couple shot dead here were due to be engaged next week. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=21.2s)]
*  That is the deepest, most poignant layer to all this. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=25.16s)]
*  They were diplomats Yaron Lechinsky and his fiance to be Sarah Milgram. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=28.92s)]
*  They represented Israel abroad. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  And the tributes now being paid to them are reflective of the better world they sought. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=37.08s)]
*  Sarah had an unwavering belief in dialogue, peace and equality, according to the charity [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  she worked with. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=46.6s)]
*  Tributes echoed by her father. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=48.6s)]
*  She was as close to perfect as any human could be. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=50.92s)]
*  If there were more people like her in the world, we wouldn't be in the state we're [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=55.32s)]
*  in today. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  They were shot at close range as they attended an event for young diplomats in Washington's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=63.32000000000001s)]
*  Jewish Museum. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=67.84s)]
*  The suspected gunman, identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, was restrained [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=69.88s)]
*  and detained moments later but with a chant which hints at his motivation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  And with that, the other layers of this tragedy were exposed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=82.88s)]
*  An attack on the victim's community, their religion, their government. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  And from the top of that government, not a beat before he called what he saw. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  As he was taken away, he chanted, free Palestine. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=97.2s)]
*  This is exactly the same chant we heard on October 7th. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=101.92s)]
*  On that day, thousands of terrorists stormed into Israel from Gaza. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  For these neo-Nazis, free Palestine is just today's version of Heil Hitler. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=110.28s)]
*  I could never understand how this simple truth evades the leaders of France, Britain, Canada [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  and others. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  They are now proposing to establish a Palestinian state and reward these murders with the ultimate [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  prize. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=131.72s)]
*  You are on the wrong side of justice. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=132.72s)]
*  You are on the wrong side of humanity. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=135.36s)]
*  And you are on the wrong side of history. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=137.88s)]
*  Netanyahu's representative in Washington, for whom the two victims worked, was here [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  to pay tribute to two brilliant people but also to echo his Prime Minister's view, exposing [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=146.12s)]
*  the thorniest layer, the accusation that it is Israel's policies in Gaza which are increasing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=151.78s)]
*  these anti-Semitic attacks. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is on the rise not because of Israel's responding but because of countries [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  like France who under this circumstance now, tomorrow, plan to propose the unilateral recognition [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=164.98s)]
*  of a Palestinian state. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=173.54s)]
*  How would you suggest that foreign governments who are deeply concerned about the Israeli [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=175.14s)]
*  government's methods in Gaza, how should they be critical without inciting violence, as [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=180.26s)]
*  you seem to be suggesting? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=187.17999999999998s)]
*  First of all, nobody is more concerned about conducting warfare than we are. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=189.14s)]
*  We're the ones who are losing our soldiers. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=194.14s)]
*  And if we could conduct a war without collateral damage, that would be wonderful. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=197.26s)]
*  Do you know of any wars where there's no collateral damage? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=202.66s)]
*  Donald Trump's Attorney General has made herself visibly part of all this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=206.42s)]
*  Clearly moved, she pledged to throw all the weight of American justice at the suspect [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  and had this on the threat levels. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=216.0s)]
*  I can tell you security has been increased here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=218.14s)]
*  Because of last night, our US Marshals are working hand in hand to make sure the embassy [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=221.46s)]
*  is safe, our ambassador is safe. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=227.22s)]
*  And again, please note, everything we know now, he acted alone. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=229.54000000000002s)]
*  From everything we know now, this is an ongoing investigation. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=233.46s)]
*  Beyond here, just blocks away, the suspected gunman's appearance in court will be his first [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  of many. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=241.94s)]
*  The politics will swirl. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=242.94s)]
*  The pain here will endure. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nyu9PWQqwg&t=244.9s)]
