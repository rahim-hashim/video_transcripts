Video Description: Thousands of Palestinians have flocked to aid distribution sites in Gaza with desperation for food overcoming concerns over Israeli-enforced checks at the centres.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is backed by Israel and the US, said on Tuesday it had distributed around 8,000 food boxes, equivalent to about 462,000 meals, just a fraction of what is needed, aid agencies say.
Sky News' Yalda Hakim breaks down the current aid situation within Gaza and shows the time line of events since October 7.

# Is aid being distributed in Gaza? | Israel-Hamas War
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc)
*  The scenes in Rafah this week come as hunger stalks the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel had placed the territory under a total blockade from March until May, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  78 days in which no food, water, fuel or medicine entered the enclave. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=9.8s)]
*  From analysing satellite imagery and video on the ground, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=15.8s)]
*  the Sky News data and forensics unit can show the extent of the situation. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=19.2s)]
*  Since October 7, until the blockade started, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=25.0s)]
*  there was an average of around 1,200 trucks going into Gaza every week. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  The pre-war average is nearly double that number. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=33.8s)]
*  Over the five days since the blockade ended, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=37.6s)]
*  trucks containing vital supplies of things like flour, baby formula [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=40.2s)]
*  and medical supplies entered Gaza. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=44.4s)]
*  But there were just 388 of them. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=46.8s)]
*  Look how far below the line it is. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  And also way below the 500 per day, the UN says, are needed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  The United Nations Relief and Works Agency told us most of these trucks were looted soon after. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=56.6s)]
*  Just who is to blame is disputed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=63.0s)]
*  The IDF says it's Hamas, while the UN blame armed gangs operating in areas [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=65.2s)]
*  which are supposed to be under Israeli control. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=70.0s)]
*  The UN's Sam Rose described a looter's valley in the south [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=73.4s)]
*  between Kerem Shalom and Khan Yunus, where they say trucks would frequently be attacked. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=77.0s)]
*  A photo posted last week showed a Palestinian man in military gear carrying an AK-47 [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=83.0s)]
*  with UN cars visible in the background. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=89.2s)]
*  It's more than three kilometres inside an IDF-declared combat zone. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=92.2s)]
*  The picture came from the Facebook page of this man, Yasser Abu Shabaab, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=96.8s)]
*  who multiple aid officials have named as a gang ringleader, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=101.6s)]
*  though he denies his men were involved in the looting. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=104.8s)]
*  The new US-backed aid system has said its continued distribution on Wednesday, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=109.2s)]
*  claiming delivery of 800,000 meals. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=113.8s)]
*  This was the scene on Tuesday as people were unpacking the boxes. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=117.0s)]
*  Aid groups, however, have said the new system puts the lives of one million Palestinians [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=121.4s)]
*  in the north at risk by forcing them to travel to the south to get to it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=127.2s)]
*  Three of the four aid hubs are located in the far south, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=132.6s)]
*  with one located in the central region. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=136.39999999999998s)]
*  And not only that, but the distribution centres are all located inside areas [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=139.39999999999998s)]
*  that the Israeli military has previously declared as combat zones. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  The compound overrun on Tuesday is one of those. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=149.2s)]
*  Even Palestinians who set up camp as close as possible to the aid hub [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=152.6s)]
*  must make a five kilometre round trip through one of the combat zones to get to food. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  The incident on Tuesday resulted in at least 47 Palestinians injured [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=163.4s)]
*  when a crowd overwhelmed the aid hub. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, said last week [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=171.8s)]
*  Israel had only authorised for Gaza what amounts to a teaspoon of aid. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=175.0s)]
*  With the new system's loss of control and recent resignation of its director, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=180.0s)]
*  questions will be raised on how vital supplies get to those in need long term. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcPTfdv_qc&t=184.8s)]
