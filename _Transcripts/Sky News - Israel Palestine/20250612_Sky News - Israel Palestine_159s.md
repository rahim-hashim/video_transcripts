# Israel says it 'eliminated' Iran's most senior military commanders in strikes
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0)
*  So let's just bring you some breaking news on this story. The IDF has said in the last [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=0.0s)]
*  few moments that it's eliminated the three most senior military commanders of the Iranian [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=8.18s)]
*  regime. They've gone on to say that more than 200 Israeli Air Force fighter jets guided, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  they say, by precise intelligence from the intelligence directorate, struck over 100 [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=20.42s)]
*  targets across Iran, something they've already announced. But they also say it included the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=25.5s)]
*  hideouts of senior operatives in the Iranian military leadership. They say that the strikes [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=30.46s)]
*  eliminated those three most senior military commanders. They say that is the chief of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=36.86s)]
*  staff of the armed forces of the Iranian regime, Mohammed Hossein Bagheri, commander of the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=41.74s)]
*  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, and commander of Khatam al-Anbiya, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=47.82s)]
*  emergency command, Gollum Ali Rashid. Well, let's get a little bit of reaction. Deborah [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=54.46s)]
*  is back with us. So Deborah, what do you make of these claims by the IDF? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=59.82s)]
*  That's what I was referring to when we were speaking earlier. I mean, it's part of not [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=64.54s)]
*  just trying to degrade, prevent Iran from developing the nuclear weapons, but also degrading [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  its actual military command and control. So the best way to attack, well, one of the ways to attack [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=76.78s)]
*  an armed force is to go after the leadership. And so the fact that they have managed in this one [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  strike, this first initial onslaught, to take out the top three military commanders for Iran, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=91.02s)]
*  that's a huge blow to the armed forces. Of course, they'll have deputies, they'll have people ready [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=99.9s)]
*  to step up and take over. But in terms of causing confusion and maybe affecting Iran's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=105.42s)]
*  immediate ability to respond, going after the leadership is exactly what the Israelis clearly [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=114.3s)]
*  intended to do. And for Iran, I mean, they've lost key leaders before. You'll remember Qassem [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force inside the IRGC when he was killed by the Americans. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=127.18s)]
*  That triggered a huge response and almost brought Iran and the US to direct confrontation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=134.62s)]
*  And so the fact now that Israel has gone so much further going after these top three leaders, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=140.86s)]
*  again, it just underlines that Iran absolutely will need to respond. How and how effective it [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  can be, that's the other, that's the main question. Deborah, thanks very much indeed for that very [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=152.46s)]
*  swift response. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoXI3XHzF0&t=157.18s)]
