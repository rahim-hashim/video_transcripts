# Hamas confirms it is in direct peace talks with US and believes Donald Trump can broker a deal
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w)
*  Are you willing to hand over all the hostages to bring an end to the bloodshed? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=0.0s)]
*  We have said it for all the mediators and for the Americans. We are ready to hand over all the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  prisoners immediately if we can be sure that this will lead to an end of this war and first and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  foremost to allow the humanitarian aid to get into Gaza. If these two conditions are fulfilled, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=17.84s)]
*  again to allow aid to get into Gaza and to reach an end to guarantee an end of this war or genocide, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=25.04s)]
*  yes we are ready to hand over all the prisoners. Are you telling the Americans this directly now? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=32.64s)]
*  Yes. What are you saying to them that these are the things that you want and do you [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=37.2s)]
*  are you getting or do you get a sense that you're getting a positive response from them? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=41.28s)]
*  We have told them this proposal or comprehensive approach one shot prisoner exchange [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=46.56s)]
*  ending the war total withdrawal of the Syrian forces allowing all the aid to get into Gaza [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=54.4s)]
*  and rebuilding of Gaza Strip without forceful immigration through the mediators and directly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=58.8s)]
*  through some persons in the US administrations. Sometimes we received a positive response, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=65.92s)]
*  in other cases I don't know why but maybe under the pressure of the Zionist loopy in the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=75.92s)]
*  American administration we got more or less negative response. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=82.08s)]
*  So even today President Trump has said the following that he would like to see the United [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=88.72s)]
*  States take Gaza, he said this multiple times now, to provide safety for Palestinians maybe [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  in Gaza maybe outside of Gaza and that Hamas needs to be dealt with. Is this the message that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  those who are talking to you at the moment from within the administration are conveying back to you? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=108.88s)]
*  I think first of all Gaza is belonging to the Palestinians and Palestinians is the only party [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=114.96s)]
*  who can decide for Gaza and for the future of Gazans. No one neither in the region or [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=121.28s)]
*  outside the region who can decide for the Palestinians what to do or what not to do [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=127.52s)]
*  and we believe in our homeland and we are committed to this homeland and we are ready [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  to pay all the prices to defend our homeland and to also to build a better future for our children [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=141.76s)]
*  on our way. We are not in a market to sell Gaza or not to sell Gaza. We're seeing demonstrations [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  in Gaza, we're seeing people frustrated after 19 months of conflict that Hamas has brought on them. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=155.76s)]
*  Yes I respect all people who are going to the street to say yes for Hamas or no for Hamas because [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=163.04s)]
*  we have seen half of the Israeli population in the streets against Netanyahu. We are still seeing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=170.88s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating against Trump president. We don't see that we [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=175.28s)]
*  are representing all Palestinians. We believe that we are still representing a vast majority of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  Palestinians. But if we go to the heart and the core of what has caused this latest devastation [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=184.88s)]
*  on the Palestinian people 19, 20 months ago. The occupation since 75 years is the cause of all this [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=189.52s)]
*  devastation. But October 7 of this current devastation, 60,000 people dead as a result of October 7. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  Because we have October 6, a lot of Palestinians were killed. We have before October 6. 60,000 people [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=202.08s)]
*  in the space of 20 months. Okay between 2000 and 2023. And that is because of October 7 and the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=207.68s)]
*  Israelis say they will not stop until their hostages are released until Hamas disarms itself [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=213.68s)]
*  and says that it no longer wishes to be the governing power. Why not? First of all again as [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=219.52s)]
*  a occupied people we have all the right to resist the occupation by all means including armed [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=224.16s)]
*  resistance. So you won't disarm. Let me continue. If you ask someone to be this armed it has to be [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=228.96s)]
*  the Israelis who have all the power, the chemical power, the nuclear power, the biological power and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=235.28s)]
*  all the support from the west including the Americans to destroy the Palestinian life like [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=240.56s)]
*  what we have seen along the 17 months. That you still have 50 or so of their hostages that you [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=247.04s)]
*  haven't released and it is in your gift, it is in your power to release them. If Hamas hands the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=253.28s)]
*  hostages over, if they disarm and they you know basically disappear from Gaza they will end this [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=258.8s)]
*  conflict. Is that something that Hamas is willing to do? We are ready to go for one session to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=264.64s)]
*  release all the captured Israelis and then return to get some of our prisoners but with [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=270.48s)]
*  the guarantees that we are going to reach an end of this war, total withdrawal of the Israeli forces. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  If the Americans ask you to disarm, step away from power, you are willing to do this tomorrow [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  including handing over all of the hostages? To hand over the government in the Gaza Strip we have [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  said it already months before that we are ready to go for any solution accepted by all Palestinians [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=295.2s)]
*  and to hand over the... But if the Americans ask you... Even we have also told the Americans we [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=301.52s)]
*  are ready to again to hand over the government immediately if we reach an end of this war [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=306.24s)]
*  and we have accepted by the way the Egyptian proposal which is talking about forming a [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=315.12s)]
*  Palestinian and independent non-affiliated body, politically not an affiliated body to run Gaza Strip. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=320.32s)]
*  But when it comes to disarmament I think yes we are ready to be disarmed in one case we have our [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=327.76s)]
*  independent self-sovereign state. If we can get it peacefully politically through based on international [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=333.44s)]
*  rules and regulations and law yes we are ready to do it but again this will happen only when we have [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=340.24s)]
*  our independent self-sovereign state. Before that as long as we are still occupied people [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=347.52s)]
*  we have all the right to continue defending our people and resisting the occupation with all means [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=352.8s)]
*  including unresistance. Do you have faith in the American teams and delegation that you're [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=358.0s)]
*  talking to that they too want to achieve an end to the conflict and be able to negotiate between [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=364.56s)]
*  the two sides? Look we believe that President Trump has done a lot of work and hard work [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=373.2s)]
*  in different areas in this region and outside the region we have seen it in Ukraine, we have seen it [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=381.92s)]
*  in Syria, we have seen it in Yemen and by adopting negotiations with Iran to solve this conflict to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=386.56s)]
*  de-escalate the tensions everywhere and to reach a more peaceful world. I think this is what is [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=394.32s)]
*  motivating us to continue contacting the American administration regardless of the team because we [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=403.52s)]
*  believe that he has done it and he can do it and I think President Trump has the capability and the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=411.28s)]
*  will to reach this peaceful situation. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A19u3Hwcl3w&t=419.36s)]
