# Inside Gaza hospital after shooting
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVHPsYwtcfA)
*  I'm still here at the NASA complex. There's been a shooting at the GHF aid distribution complex in Rafa. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVHPsYwtcfA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm in the emergency department. We're receiving quite a few of the casualties now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVHPsYwtcfA&t=9.0s)]
*  The ambulances haven't stopped coming, but we know that a lot of the injured were taken to the local field hospitals. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVHPsYwtcfA&t=14.0s)]
*  So places like ICRC and UK Med. And we're dealing with the people that actually managed to get as far as NASA, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVHPsYwtcfA&t=20.0s)]
*  which as you know is in the red zone. So not an easy journey to make from Rafa. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVHPsYwtcfA&t=28.0s)]
