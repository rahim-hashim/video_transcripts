# Analysis: Israel strikes on Iran 'moment Middle East has been waiting for' | Dominic Waghorn
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q)
*  Well, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency has released a statement attributed to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=5.68s)]
*  It reads, this regime must await severe punishment. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=9.34s)]
*  By God's will, the powerful arm of the Islamic Republic's armed forces will not let it go [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=13.16s)]
*  unpunished. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=17.6s)]
*  In the enemy's attacks, a number of commanders and scientists were martyred. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=19.22s)]
*  Their successors and colleagues will immediately continue their duties, God willing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=23.56s)]
*  With this crime, the Zionist regime has brought a bitter and painful fate upon itself, and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=28.32s)]
*  it will certainly face it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=33.4s)]
*  Well, let's bring in our International Affairs Officer, Dominic Wackhorn, now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=35.52s)]
*  He joins us from the newsroom now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=39.68s)]
*  Hi there, Dominic. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=42.04s)]
*  What do you make of these strikes? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=43.04s)]
*  We've seen strikes by Israel on Iran in recent times, but this feels like a whole different [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=45.56s)]
*  scale, doesn't it? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=51.36s)]
*  Yeah, this is the big one. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=52.36s)]
*  This is the moment that I think people across the Middle East have been waiting for. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=53.36s)]
*  And expecting at some point for years, and something that the Israeli leader Benjamin [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=58.48s)]
*  Netanyahu has threatened and kind of made it a lifetime ambition to make happen for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  so long. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=69.0s)]
*  And it does seem to be the real thing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=70.0s)]
*  As you say, we've had Israeli attacks on Iran before, and of course we had the first direct [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=71.28s)]
*  sort of hostilities between these two sworn enemies last year. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=76.24s)]
*  But this is the moment, it seems, where Israel has decided that it is now time to try and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=80.8s)]
*  take out the Iranian nuclear programme. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=85.02s)]
*  Netanyahu has kind of made it an ambition of his to destroy this, what he regards or says [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=87.82s)]
*  he's regarded at least as an existential threat against Israel for years. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=94.06s)]
*  He clearly believes that Iran has been seeking to develop the technology to fulfil its threat [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=100.14s)]
*  to erase Israel off the face of the earth. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=109.34s)]
*  He's always said that this is effectively his sacred duty as a leader of the Jewish [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=112.3s)]
*  state to stop that happening and to remove from or take away from the Iranians any ability [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=116.62s)]
*  to do so. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  Now, what he said in this statement overnight is that he believes the Iranians have gone [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  a step farther than what they've ever done before. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=129.02s)]
*  They've tried to enrich uranium. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=131.78s)]
*  They agreed to not do so and to hand over their enriched uranium under the JCPOA, as [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=134.62s)]
*  it's called, the Iranian nuclear deal. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=139.74s)]
*  But then Donald Trump ripped up America's signature on that deal and Iran went back [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=141.9s)]
*  to enriching uranium and has most recently developed enough fissile material. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=146.7s)]
*  You have to basically spin uranium in centrifuges to develop the fissile material, make it enriched [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=151.9s)]
*  enough to be able to turn that into a bomb. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=157.5s)]
*  And it had produced enough of that, the Israelis and the American and other Western intelligence [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=160.62s)]
*  agencies believe, to produce nine nuclear bombs relatively recently. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=164.9s)]
*  But to actually turn that into an effective nuclear bomb you could then deploy would have [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=170.14s)]
*  taken between 18 months to two years longer. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=174.98s)]
*  Now, what the Israeli prime minister is saying is that he believes and his Israeli intelligence [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=178.26s)]
*  agencies believe that the Iranians have gone to that next step of trying to weaponise its [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  fissile material stockpile. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=190.38s)]
*  And the reason it was doing so is certainly the implication of what the Israeli prime [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=192.29999999999998s)]
*  minister is saying, is that its other insurance policy, which was Hisbollah and Hamas, his [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=195.9s)]
*  proxy allies on the sort of doorstep of Israel, have been destroyed by Israel and therefore [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=200.22s)]
*  the Iranians are looking for a plan B and therefore we're going hell for leather to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=207.78s)]
*  build the bomb. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=211.18s)]
*  Now, it's the first time he's said that and no other Israeli official overnight has repeated [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=212.18s)]
*  that claim. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=216.46s)]
*  So I think his allies will ask for evidence that that is the case. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=217.46s)]
*  But if he believed that was the case, then he's now justifying these attacks in that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=220.9s)]
*  light. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=226.9s)]
*  I think the big question now, of course, is what does Iran do in response? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=227.9s)]
*  We've heard, as you say, the Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader responding there, but also [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=232.22000000000003s)]
*  from Iran military, the Twitter accounts that the Iranian military has saying simply this, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  this will not be, talking about its retaliation, a mere demonstration of will or technological [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=242.74s)]
*  capability. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=248.22000000000003s)]
*  This time our response will be lethal. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=249.22s)]
*  So basically saying that those attacks, those ballistic missiles we saw last October, were [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=251.06s)]
*  a demonstration of will, what the world's going to see now is going to be very different [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=256.06s)]
*  and it may not be aimed just at Israel. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=260.82s)]
*  The Iranians have always said that if their nuclear programme is attacked, they won't [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=262.94s)]
*  just strike back at Israel. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=267.06s)]
*  They'll assume that America was involved as well, although the Iranians have said, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=268.54s)]
*  the Americans have said it's a unilateral strike. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=272.7s)]
*  I think the assumption we can make is the Iranians will, if they have the ability still [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=276.85999999999996s)]
*  to do so, strike Israel, but also US bases, possibly in the Persian Gulf, US allies in [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=280.41999999999996s)]
*  the Gulf and oil installations as well. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  And that will, I think, create a step change in this conflict and it threatens, I think, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=288.85999999999996s)]
*  to escalate things into a much more grave situation, not just for the region but potentially [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=293.29999999999995s)]
*  for the world as well, of course, because the Persian Gulf is so crucial to the world's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=297.82s)]
*  oil industry and to trading generally. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H44Ky4wR1Q&t=302.5s)]
