# What does the Israeli defence forces fighting zone look like?
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY)
*  As soon as President Trump left the Middle East after his recent trip, Israeli defense [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=0.0s)]
*  forces moved back into the Gaza Strip in some force as they'd said that they would once [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  the presidential trip was over. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=8.82s)]
*  Thousands of IDF reservists have been called up for this, and we've witnessed Macarver [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  four tanks moving back into Gaza in a strength not seen since November 2023, when IDF ground [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  operations really began. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=20.16s)]
*  Before Operations Gideon's Chariots was launched, these were the evacuation zones then in place. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=22.82s)]
*  The IDF has now extended those zones where they say civilians should leave yet again [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=28.8s)]
*  and move into designated safe areas. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  From the IDF's perspective, the evacuation zones are their fighting zones, the areas [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=36.04s)]
*  where they claim the right to regard anyone left there as a Hamas enemy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=39.92s)]
*  So this is what the IDF's current fighting zone looks like. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=44.84s)]
*  It runs along the Philadelphia corridor at Rafah along the border with Egypt. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=48.44s)]
*  It runs along the Netzerim corridor north of Khan Younis and south of Gaza City. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=51.96s)]
*  And those zones will allow the IDF to cut the strip into two and in due course three [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=56.68s)]
*  separate sections for clearance operations. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=60.72s)]
*  All that is achievable since Hamas has long been beaten in a military sense, so it's easy [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=64.36s)]
*  to see what IDF tactics on the ground are. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=68.6s)]
*  But it is harder to discern the strategy behind those tactics. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=71.56s)]
*  The IDF seem to be indicating that they will commence a classic counterinsurgency operation [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=76.16s)]
*  in Gaza, working to eradicate Hamas from each zone as they move on to the next, cornering [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=80.8s)]
*  the enemy into a small area before finally destroying them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=85.7s)]
*  But that only makes sense if the population stays where it is and is then made to feel [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=90.18s)]
*  more secure, more prosperous and far better off without Hamas around. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=94.06s)]
*  Increasing the misery of the population by cornering them into a small zone doesn't [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=98.34s)]
*  make any sense as a counterinsurgency strategy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=102.54s)]
*  The IDF's fighting zone now amounts to almost 80% of the territory and that means that the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  key ultra-nationalists in the government say something completely different. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=112.26s)]
*  They say that the strategy is for a full reoccupation of Gaza with space for Israeli settlers to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=116.42s)]
*  move back in. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=121.54s)]
*  They say that the misery of gardens will encourage them to want to move abroad if given the chance. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=122.54s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu himself has not committed to this but he continues to talk about complete [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=128.5s)]
*  control over Gaza, whatever that means. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  Militarily, the IDF could take control of the whole territory and it could cope with [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=136.54000000000002s)]
*  an angry and distressed population of 2 million Gazans herded into not much more than 20% [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=141.34s)]
*  of their own country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=146.66000000000003s)]
*  But on the simple arithmetic of how many troops it takes to hold an angry population in check, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=148.38000000000002s)]
*  the majority of the IDF and its self-deployment reservists, thousands, would be fully deployed [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  just doing that for a long time. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=158.34s)]
*  You know, that's hard to square with the meaningful political victory over Hamas of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=161.3s)]
*  the sort that Prime Minister Netanyahu demanded some 20 months ago. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25cdcd3XjY&t=164.9s)]
