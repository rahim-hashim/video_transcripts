# Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announces plans to seize the whole of Gaza
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4)
*  These tanks in southern Israel today are getting ready to move into Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's war, almost 19 months long now, is entering a new phase with perhaps permanent consequences for the two million Palestinians that live there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=5.0s)]
*  The Israeli cabinet has said it will call up thousands of reservists and intensify the fighting to conquer large parts of Gaza and then occupy them. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=16.0s)]
*  We decided to take intensified action in Gaza. That was the chief of staff's recommendation, to move, as he said, toward the defeat of Hamas. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=28.0s)]
*  He believes this will also help us rescue the hostages and I agree with him. We are not letting up on this effort and we will not give up on anyone. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=39.0s)]
*  How long Israeli troops will remain in the parts of Gaza is still to be determined, an official has told Sky News. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=48.0s)]
*  But some senior cabinet members are already saying it will be permanent. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=55.0s)]
*  We can no longer bear the pressure, the war, the killing, the death and bombing. We can no longer endure anything. Hunger, destruction, displacement from one place to another, every day in a different place. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=63.0s)]
*  Frankly, we need a solution. We want a truce. We want a long-term truce so that we can rest, so that our people can rest. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=74.0s)]
*  What more can happen? Children have died, children have been displaced, children have gone hungry, hungry, homes have been destroyed. What more can happen? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=82.0s)]
*  At least 17 people were killed in airstrikes on Sunday night. They were buried today. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=94.0s)]
*  Fighting in Gaza resumed in March when Israel broke the ceasefire after a two-month pause. Since then, no hostages have been released and Hamas has not been defeated. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=99.0s)]
*  The humanitarian situation in Gaza is reaching breaking point, aid agencies have said. Food is running out and fuel supplies are extremely low. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=113.0s)]
*  Our team filmed these cues for bread in Gaza City. Israel says there is still enough aid in Gaza to go around, but the evidence on the ground is of desperation. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=123.0s)]
*  Israel says it is now considering letting aid in and looking at ways to distribute it, but no plan has been revealed and no timeline set. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=136.0s)]
*  President Trump is due to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE in 10 days' time. He is not currently scheduled to visit Israel. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=149.0s)]
*  Israeli officials say there is a window for Hamas to agree a new deal before Trump arrives in the region. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=158.0s)]
*  If not, they will launch the new offensive and drive Gazans out of the north, perhaps for good. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=165.0s)]
*  Alistair Bungle, Sky News, in Jerusalem. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmBXXhGx4I4&t=174.0s)]
