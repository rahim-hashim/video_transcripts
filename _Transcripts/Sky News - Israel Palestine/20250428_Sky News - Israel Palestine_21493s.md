*  Thank you Mr President. Mr President, members of the Court, it's a great honour for me [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=642.34s)]
*  to appear in front of you on behalf of the Secretary General of the United Nations in [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=648.7s)]
*  the context of this request for an advisory opinion. At the outset, I want to underline [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=652.66s)]
*  that the Secretary General is making every effort to alleviate and bring to an end the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=660.02s)]
*  ongoing and persistent human suffering of the population in Israel and the occupied [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=664.86s)]
*  Palestinian territory, including the hostages and their families and all those affected [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=670.06s)]
*  by the ongoing armed conflict. There is an urgent need to return to a ceasefire and for [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=675.1s)]
*  the parties to respect their obligations under international law. The Secretary General [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=682.58s)]
*  has consistently reiterated his strong and unequivocal condemnation of the abhorrent [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=688.26s)]
*  acts of terror by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups on 7 October 2023. He has also [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=693.5s)]
*  repeatedly called for all the hostages to be released immediately and unconditionally. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=700.44s)]
*  No humanitarian aid or commercial goods have been allowed into Gaza since 2 March, which [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=708.78s)]
*  has devastating humanitarian consequences in the Gaza Strip. The Secretary General continues [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=715.62s)]
*  to call for humanitarian aid to reach all people in need. As I stand before you, 295 [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=721.26s)]
*  United Nations personnel have died in Gaza since 7 October 2023. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=730.4599999999999s)]
*  Mr President, the request in General Assembly Resolution 79232 that the Court render an [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=737.5s)]
*  advisory opinion focuses on the obligations of the State of Israel. This statement will [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=743.42s)]
*  therefore do likewise. Before doing so, I want to reiterate that all parties to a conflict [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=748.98s)]
*  must comply with all their obligations under international law, including international [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=756.38s)]
*  humanitarian law and international human rights law at all times. In the context of the situation [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=761.14s)]
*  in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, Israel, the State of Palestine and non-State [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=767.46s)]
*  actors, including Palestinian armed groups such as Hamas, have obligations under international [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=773.46s)]
*  law that must be observed. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=778.58s)]
*  Mr President, Members of the Court, the purpose of this oral statement is to assist the Court [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=782.5s)]
*  in the present advisory proceedings concerning the obligations of Israel as occupying power [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=792.42s)]
*  and member of the United Nations with regard to the presence and activities of the United [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=799.66s)]
*  Nations in and in connection with the occupied Palestinian territory. The United Nations [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=806.3399999999999s)]
*  has a special and direct interest in these proceedings. Detailed information has already [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=814.98s)]
*  been provided in the written statement on the presence and activities of the 13 United [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=823.3000000000001s)]
*  Nations entities in the occupied Palestinian territory. So I will not repeat that information [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=829.62s)]
*  today. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=837.0600000000001s)]
*  I shall confine myself to pointing out that all these entities are subsidiary organs [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=839.98s)]
*  of the United Nations within the meaning of the Charter or form part of the United Nations [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=845.54s)]
*  Secretariat. In this respect, I would stress that the status of these entities is irrefutable. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=851.3000000000001s)]
*  These entities are engaged in the unhindered supply of basic necessities essential to the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=861.26s)]
*  survival of the Palestinian civilian population. Also, in some cases, these entities are engaged [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=868.46s)]
*  in the provision of basic services and humanitarian and development assistance in the interest [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=875.82s)]
*  of the Palestinian civilian population and in support of the right of the Palestinian [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=884.26s)]
*  population to self-determination. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=889.74s)]
*  Today I will present my remarks as follows. First, I will refer to Israel's obligations [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=893.84s)]
*  as the occupying power. And second, I will refer to Israel's obligations as a member [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=902.5600000000001s)]
*  of the United Nations. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=910.0400000000001s)]
*  Members of the Court, I will now elaborate on the obligations of Israel as an occupying [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=911.44s)]
*  power. After making initial preliminary remarks, I will turn to three specific issues. First, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=917.4s)]
*  the scope of relief schemes under the Fourth Geneva Convention. Second, the limitations [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=925.22s)]
*  on the authority of the occupying power to administer an occupied territory. And third, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=931.34s)]
*  the protection of humanitarian, medical and United Nations personnel in general. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=938.02s)]
*  Israel has several obligations in relation to the presence and activities of the United [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=945.34s)]
*  Nations and the occupied Palestinian territory by virtue of its status as the occupying power. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=949.2s)]
*  These obligations include the following obligations under international humanitarian law. The [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  overarching obligation to administer the territory for the benefit of the local population. The [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=961.5600000000001s)]
*  obligation to agree to and facilitate relief schemes. The obligation to facilitate the [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=967.22s)]
*  proper working of all institutions devoted to the care and education of children. And the obligation to maintain [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=974.1s)]
*  the medical and hospital establishments and services, including those set up by United [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=980.8199999999999s)]
*  Nations entities. In the specific context of the current situation in the occupied Palestinian [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=986.3s)]
*  territory, these obligations entail allowing and facilitating all relevant United Nations [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=992.54s)]
*  entities to carry out those activities for the benefit of the local population. In addition [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=998.3s)]
*  to international humanitarian law obligations, international human rights law obligations [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1004.4799999999999s)]
*  are also applicable to the conduct of Israel with regard to the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1008.6999999999999s)]
*  This includes respecting the decisions of the representative of the Palestinian people [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1014.54s)]
*  to receive basic goods and services from the United Nations entities in order to fully [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1018.52s)]
*  enjoy their right to self-determination. Israel is bound to respect the decision of the Palestinian [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1022.94s)]
*  people on the manner in which the dependence of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1029.66s)]
*  and Gaza on Israel for the provision of basic goods and services should be reduced. Israel [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1034.66s)]
*  has the obligation to render assistance to such activities of the United Nations. Mr. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1040.74s)]
*  President, Members of the Court, against this background of an overarching framework, I [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1047.18s)]
*  would like now to move specifically address three points of international humanitarian [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1052.8200000000002s)]
*  law. First, I would like to address the scope of relief schemes under Article 59 of the [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1057.38s)]
*  Fourth Geneva Convention. I recall that under Article 59, the occupying power is required [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1063.3400000000001s)]
*  to agree to relief schemes and facilitate them if the whole or part of the population [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1069.66s)]
*  of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied. Article 59 refers to relief schemes in general. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1074.58s)]
*  The plain terms of Article 59 do not limit relief schemes to objects that are urgently [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1083.4199999999998s)]
*  needed for the survival of the civilian population. Article 59, paragraph 2, specifically refers [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1088.3799999999999s)]
*  to foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing. These are examples of relief supplies and [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1095.34s)]
*  do not constitute an exhaustive list of objects that constitute relief schemes. The content [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1101.58s)]
*  of relief schemes depends on the needs of the population of an occupied territory. The [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1107.42s)]
*  legal obligation covers those needs that have to be addressed immediately. For example, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1112.22s)]
*  when a large number of populations is displaced due to military operations, relief schemes [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1117.1399999999999s)]
*  would comprise items that are essential to address their immediate needs, such as food, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1121.42s)]
*  water, shelter and hygiene facilities. The definition should also be understood to cover [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1125.82s)]
*  needs which may be more long-term, in particular in cases of prolonged occupation. For example, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1132.1s)]
*  relief schemes to address long-term needs may include items that are essential for the [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1139.86s)]
*  construction and repair of certain infrastructures, including medical and sanitation facilities, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1145.02s)]
*  and items and services to eradicate poverty. Therefore, the needs of the population in [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1151.44s)]
*  an occupied territory could evolve depending on the nature and duration of the occupation, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1157.8400000000001s)]
*  and relief schemes need to be adapted to the evolving needs. The occupying power must agree [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1162.68s)]
*  to such relief schemes as adapted and facilitate them. Second, the authority of the occupying [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1168.8200000000002s)]
*  power to administer an occupied territory must be exercised in a manner that is consistent [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1175.9399999999998s)]
*  with international humanitarian law. Any measures taken by the occupying power to ensure its [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1181.6599999999999s)]
*  security must be exercised in a manner that would not deny impartial humanitarian organisations [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1188.24s)]
*  such as the United Nations the ability to carry out relief schemes while part of the [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1194.8999999999999s)]
*  population of an occupied territory continues to be inadequately supplied. In instances [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1200.74s)]
*  where the occupying power has concerns with the impartiality of a humanitarian organisation, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1207.46s)]
*  the occupying power may not unilaterally declare that such humanitarian organisation is not [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1213.1s)]
*  impartial and deny its relief schemes. Such concerns must be addressed in consultation [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1217.54s)]
*  with a humanitarian organisation concerned. I will elaborate on this point later. Third, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1224.26s)]
*  under international law, including international humanitarian law, humanitarian relief personnel, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1231.26s)]
*  medical personnel and United Nations personnel must be respected and protected. As such, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1237.26s)]
*  attacks may not be directed against such personnel as long as they are entitled to the protection [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1245.26s)]
*  given to civilians under international humanitarian law. At every stage of the conduct of military [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1249.26s)]
*  operations, all feasible precautions must be taken to avoid and in any event to minimise [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1256.78s)]
*  incidental casualties to humanitarian, medical and United Nations personnel. They must be [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1262.7s)]
*  treated humanely and must not be subjected to harassment or intimidation. They are also [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1268.82s)]
*  protected by international human rights law. As such, they must not be subjected to arbitrary [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1274.62s)]
*  arrest or detention. United Nations personnel, including those who carry out humanitarian [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1281.62s)]
*  and medical work for the United Nations, are also accorded particular status under the [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1288.86s)]
*  Charter of the United Nations and the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1293.3799999999999s)]
*  Nations, to which Israel is a party. Consistently with their status as United Nations officials [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1298.58s)]
*  or experts, United Nations personnel may not be attacked, arrested or detained or subjected [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1304.4399999999998s)]
*  to any form of legal process in connection with their official functions. Privileges [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1311.06s)]
*  and immunities are granted to United Nations personnel in the interests of the organisation. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1316.46s)]
*  Interference with their functions impedes the activities of the United Nations as an [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1322.46s)]
*  organisation. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1327.46s)]
*  Mr President, Members of the Court, I will now move on to the second part of my statement [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1330.22s)]
*  which concerns Israel's obligations as a member of the United Nations. I will start [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1335.58s)]
*  by recalling the unlawfulness of Israel's continued presence in the occupied Palestinian [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1341.18s)]
*  territory and the relevance of this to the present proceedings. I will then recall the [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1345.42s)]
*  general obligations arising from the Charter and the 1946 Convention on the Privileges [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1350.58s)]
*  and Immunities of the United Nations, which I shall refer to in my statement as the General [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1355.62s)]
*  Convention. I will then specifically discuss, first, the inviolability of United Nations [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1359.66s)]
*  premises, second, the general obligation of cooperation with the United Nations and third, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1365.7s)]
*  the issue of impartiality of certain United Nations entities. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1372.5s)]
*  Mr President, Members of the Court, I will now turn to the first point, the unlawfulness [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1377.22s)]
*  of Israel's continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territory and the relevance of [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1382.98s)]
*  this to the present proceedings. Under international law, states, including members of the United [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1387.74s)]
*  Nations, are prohibited from acquiring territory by force. In the advisory opinion of 19 July [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1394.18s)]
*  2024, this Court concluded that Israel's assertion of sovereignty over and its annexation [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1401.5s)]
*  of certain parts of the occupied Palestinian territory constitute a violation of the prohibition [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1407.78s)]
*  the acquisition of territory by force. On this basis, the Court has authoritatively [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1413.6200000000001s)]
*  determined that Israel is not entitled to sovereignty over or to exercise sovereign [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1419.46s)]
*  powers in any part of the occupied Palestinian territory on account of its occupation. The [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1424.1000000000001s)]
*  enactment of the law to cease UNRWA operations and of the law to cease UNRWA operations in [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1430.8200000000002s)]
*  the territory of the State of Israel by the Knesset of Israel on 28 October 2024 appears [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1436.3000000000002s)]
*  to constitute an extension of sovereignty over or exercise sovereign powers in the [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1442.14s)]
*  occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. The same can be stated regarding [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1446.94s)]
*  any measures taken on the basis of those laws and other applicable Israeli law in the occupied [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1452.8200000000002s)]
*  Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. They are, as such, inconsistent with Israel's [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1459.3400000000001s)]
*  obligation under international law. Insofar as the law to cease UNRWA operations in the [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1465.3400000000001s)]
*  territory of the State of Israel, among other effects, prevents UNRWA operations in East [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1470.82s)]
*  Jerusalem, which Israel considers to be part of the territory of the State of Israel, the [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1475.5s)]
*  enactment and implementation of this law is also inconsistent with the international legal [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1480.02s)]
*  status of East Jerusalem. I will now turn to certain general obligations [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1484.46s)]
*  under the Charter. The present proceedings are crucial because they will afford the opportunity [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1489.58s)]
*  to clarify certain fundamental elements of the legal framework applicable to the United [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1495.02s)]
*  Nations. The status of Israel as a member of the United Nations entails several legal [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1499.74s)]
*  obligations concerning the presence and activities of the United Nations in and in relation to [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1506.1s)]
*  the occupied Palestinian territory. These obligations are all essential for the organisation [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1511.82s)]
*  to properly function and perform the mandates it has been entrusted by its member states. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1517.6200000000001s)]
*  The exclusively international character of these functions and mandates is enshrined [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1524.98s)]
*  in Article 100 of the Charter. When the basic elements of this legal framework are not observed, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1529.76s)]
*  the very nature of the work of the organisation on behalf of its member states is in jeopardy. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1535.74s)]
*  The basic elements of the legal framework of the United Nations include general principles [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1541.66s)]
*  of good faith and cooperation with the organisation, obligations concerning the safety and security [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1546.04s)]
*  of United Nations premises, property, assets and personnel, and more specifically, obligations [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1552.5800000000002s)]
*  concerning the privileges and immunities of the United Nations and its premises, property, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1559.66s)]
*  assets and personnel. Regarding these, I wish to note that the Charter confers certain privileges [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1565.0600000000002s)]
*  and immunities to the organisation so that it may fulfil its purposes, as Article 105 [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1571.74s)]
*  of the Charter makes clear. Such privileges and immunities are applicable to all entities [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1577.94s)]
*  that are integral to the United Nations, including its subsidiary organs such as UNRWA, which [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1584.02s)]
*  was established by the General Assembly as its subsidiary organ. In the written statement [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1589.94s)]
*  of the Secretary-General, the obligations stemming from the Charter and from the General [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1595.9s)]
*  Convention were elaborated in detail. These principles are well set in law and practice. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1599.82s)]
*  In this regard, I welcome the fact that a clear majority of member states, having submitted [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1608.54s)]
*  written statements, appear to agree on the importance of the privileges and immunities [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1612.26s)]
*  of the organisation and its personnel. Today, I wish to underline, before turning to certain [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1616.62s)]
*  specific points, the importance for United Nations operations of the obligation to uphold [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1623.26s)]
*  the immunity from legal process of the United Nations and its personnel, irrespective of [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1629.62s)]
*  which United Nations entity they may be assigned to. Equally important is the obligation to [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1634.5s)]
*  facilitate the movement of supplies, goods and equipment of the United Nations and the [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1641.1799999999998s)]
*  freedom of movement of its personnel. Particularly since the end of January this year, United [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1647.1s)]
*  Nations operations on the ground, specifically for UNRWA, have faced increasingly difficult [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1653.1799999999998s)]
*  conditions. Following the enactment and implementation of the Knesset laws, the issuance of visas [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1657.98s)]
*  to UN personnel has been further denied or restricted, and actions have been taken against [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1664.54s)]
*  UNRWA personnel in connection with their duties for the organisation. There has been unauthorised [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1669.06s)]
*  entry into UNRWA schools and orders for their closure have been issued, notwithstanding [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1673.98s)]
*  the ongoing mandate for UNRWA activities. In this regard, it is necessary to uphold [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1679.38s)]
*  the privileges and immunities of the United Nations and its personnel. As set out in documents [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1684.74s)]
*  contained in the dossier provided to the Court, violations of these obligations have occurred. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1690.3s)]
*  Differences arising out of the interpretation or application of the General Convention may [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1696.94s)]
*  result in a situation in which a difference under the General Convention has arisen between [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1701.5s)]
*  the United Nations and Israel. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1706.02s)]
*  Mr President, Members of the Court, I would like now to elaborate more specifically on [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1708.34s)]
*  three points. First, I wish to emphasise the absolute and mandatory obligation to respect [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1713.58s)]
*  the inviolability of the United Nations' premises, property and assets at all times, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1720.8999999999999s)]
*  including during armed conflict in accordance with international law. Article 2, Section [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1726.3799999999999s)]
*  3 of the General Convention provides that the premises of the United Nations will be [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1731.8999999999999s)]
*  inviolable, also that property and assets of the United Nations, wherever located and [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1736.58s)]
*  by whom so ever held, shall be immune from search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1742.98s)]
*  and any other form of interference, whether by executive, administrative, judicial or [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1749.98s)]
*  legislative action. Consistently with this provision, inviolability entails that state [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1754.8600000000001s)]
*  agents may not enter or otherwise physically penetrate or physically interfere with the [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1760.46s)]
*  United Nations' premises without the prior consents of the United Nations. It also entails [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1765.5s)]
*  a duty on the part of the state to take all appropriate measures to prevent the United [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1771.62s)]
*  Nations' premises being entered or otherwise physically penetrated, damaged or interfered [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1775.7s)]
*  with by other actors. State officials, including members of the armed forces and domestic law [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1780.26s)]
*  enforcement authorities, may not enter United Nations' premises without authorisation by [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1786.16s)]
*  the United Nations. Any other form of interference is also prohibited by Article 2, Section 3 [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1790.66s)]
*  of the General Convention. These obligations therefore also prohibit any state authorities, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1797.08s)]
*  including a state's armed forces or security forces, from hitting, damaging or attacking [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1804.08s)]
*  United Nations' premises, property and assets. There are no stated qualifications to or limitations [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1808.6399999999999s)]
*  on inviolability in the General Convention and other relevant agreements. There is no [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1815.06s)]
*  reference to inviolability being merely functional in nature, as is in the case for certain other [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1820.3999999999999s)]
*  provisions in the General Convention. Nor is there any reference in the General Convention [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1826.76s)]
*  to situations of armed conflict, civil unrest or other emergency situations as constituting [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1831.18s)]
*  possible limitations on such inviolability. The respect for the inviolability of United [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1836.4s)]
*  Nations' premises, property and assets is an indispensable precondition for the organisation [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1842.96s)]
*  to be able to implement its mandated activities all over the world, including in the occupied [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1848.22s)]
*  territory. Serious breaches of international law have been committed by parties to the [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1853.84s)]
*  ongoing conflict. But a breach by one party does not excuse breaches by other parties. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1859.28s)]
*  I will now refer to the second point, the general principles that enshrine obligations [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1866.56s)]
*  of cooperation with the United Nations. It is from the preamble of the Charter that we [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1870.56s)]
*  derive the notion that Member States have committed to combining their efforts to accomplish [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1876.8799999999999s)]
*  the aims of the organisation. Among the principles set out in Article 2 of the Charter is that [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1882.68s)]
*  all Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1889.76s)]
*  membership, shall fulfil in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1894.6s)]
*  with the present Charter. Another of the principles is set out in Article 2, paragraph 5 of the [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1899.32s)]
*  Charter, which requires in its first part that all Members shall give the United Nations [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1904.76s)]
*  every assistance in every action it takes in accordance with the present Charter. Consistently [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1909.56s)]
*  with the Court's interpretation of Article 2, paragraph 5 of the Charter, in its advisory [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1915.44s)]
*  opinion concerning reparation for injuries suffered in the service of the United Nations, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1920.08s)]
*  in the practice of the Secretariat, Article 2, paragraph 5 of the Charter has generally [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1925.48s)]
*  been interpreted as meaning that Member States are required to provide every assistance to [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1930.78s)]
*  the United Nations entities to ensure the effective implementation of their mandates. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1935.32s)]
*  In this context, it has been generally relied upon when calling upon States to comply with [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1940.24s)]
*  their obligations under Article 105 of the Charter and the General Convention. In the [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1945.4399999999998s)]
*  present case, the United Nations action consists of the activities carried out by a number [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1951.28s)]
*  of United Nations entities in the occupied Palestinian territory. Such activities are [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1957.36s)]
*  carried out consistent with resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1962.84s)]
*  and with mandates provided by various United Nations bodies in a context in which this [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1967.6799999999998s)]
*  Court is authoritatively held that Israel is not entitled to sovereignty or to exercise [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1972.6s)]
*  sovereign powers. In these circumstances, Article 2, paragraph 5 of the Charter is directly [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1977.48s)]
*  relevant in the context of Israel's responsibilities vis-à-vis the presence and activities of [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1983.52s)]
*  the United Nations in and in relation to the occupied Palestinian territory, in accordance [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1988.44s)]
*  with international law, including other provisions of the Charter. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1993.04s)]
*  Finally, my third point, referred to in certain written submissions, relates to allegations [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=1997.16s)]
*  that have been raised as to the impartiality of certain United Nations entities. The United [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2002.8400000000001s)]
*  Nations considers very seriously any credible allegations against the organisation, including [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2008.88s)]
*  those involving its personnel or misuse of its premises. Any such concerns must be brought [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2013.7s)]
*  to the attention of the organisation so that the matter may be considered by the United [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2019.5s)]
*  Nations in accordance with its legal framework, including the privileges and immunities of [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2023.54s)]
*  the organisations and its personnel. The organisation has established a framework [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2028.02s)]
*  to address and investigate specific allegations of incidents brought to its attention, which [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2033.22s)]
*  is in line with the status, privileges and immunities of the UN. With regard to allegations [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2038.06s)]
*  against United Nations personnel, the regulatory frameworks of the United Nations require such [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2043.62s)]
*  allegations to be confirmed through an internal administrative investigation, which may include [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2048.8199999999997s)]
*  referring the allegations to the Office of Internal Oversight Services, or IOS, for investigation. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2053.94s)]
*  The ability of the United Nations to further inquire into allegations depends on the full [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2061.94s)]
*  cooperation of Member States, including the provision of relevant documents and materials [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2066.5s)]
*  without which the organisation may not have sufficient basis to take further action in [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2071.3s)]
*  specific cases. Where concerns relate to broader issues, the [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2076.46s)]
*  organisation has taken further steps to review the matter. For example, following allegations [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2081.5s)]
*  that have been raised against UNRWA and its personnel, UNRWA and OIOS have taken steps [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2086.42s)]
*  to investigate those allegations in line with the organisation's regulatory framework and [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2091.5600000000004s)]
*  In response to Israel's concerns regarding the neutrality of UNRWA personnel more broadly, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2097.08s)]
*  the Secretary-General appointed the former Foreign Minister of France, Catherine Colonna, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2102.7999999999997s)]
*  to lead an independent review to assess whether UNRWA was doing everything within its power [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2107.08s)]
*  to ensure neutrality and respond to allegations of serious neutrality breaches when they are [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2112.44s)]
*  made. The Secretary-General and UNRWA have expressed their commitment to fully implementing [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2117.96s)]
*  the review's recommendations with the support of Member States. We note that such steps [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2122.84s)]
*  have been welcomed by the General Assembly and by a number of Member States in their [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2128.1600000000003s)]
*  written submissions for these proceedings. Mr President, Members of the Court, I conclude [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2132.2400000000002s)]
*  by recalling that Israel continues to launch devastating strikes on Gaza, strikes that [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2141.6600000000003s)]
*  have continued to claim the lives of hundreds of civilians, including United Nations personnel. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2148.16s)]
*  Furthermore, no humanitarian assistance has been allowed into the Gaza Strip since early [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2155.16s)]
*  March. As a result, the Secretary-General has taken the difficult decision to reduce [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2161.12s)]
*  the organisation's presence in the Gaza Strip, even as humanitarian needs are increasing [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2168.8799999999997s)]
*  dramatically and our concern for the protection of civilians is growing. The United Nations [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2175.12s)]
*  is determined to carry out its mandates in the occupied Palestinian territory, including [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2182.2s)]
*  Gaza, in particular by providing civilians with the assistance they need to ensure their [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2188.44s)]
*  survival. In order for United Nations entities to carry out their functions, all parties [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2195.48s)]
*  to the conflict must fully respect their obligations under international law, including the obligation [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2204.2799999999997s)]
*  to protect the absolute inviolability of United Nations premises and the obligation to ensure [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2211.2s)]
*  respect for the independence and status of United Nations personnel. In this regard, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2218.9199999999996s)]
*  Israel's compliance with its obligations under international law is essential for the United [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2226.7599999999998s)]
*  Nations entities to carry out their mandates in and in relation to the occupied Palestinian [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2233.52s)]
*  territory. Such respect for international law is equally essential for the protection [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2241.16s)]
*  of civilians and so that our colleagues at the United Nations can continue to work to [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2247.92s)]
*  save civilian lives without facing intolerable risks. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2254.16s)]
*  Respect for international law by all parties remains the only option for lasting peace, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2262.32s)]
*  as well as for the security and justice of Israelis and Palestinians. Mr President, members [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2269.1600000000003s)]
*  of the Court, thank you for your attention. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2277.0800000000004s)]
*  I thank Ms Elna Ohamsholt. I now invite the next participating delegation, Palestine, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2282.84s)]
*  to address the Court, and I call His Excellency Ambassador Amal Hijazi to the podium. You [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2291.32s)]
*  have the floor, Your Excellency. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2300.04s)]
*  Mr President, members of the Court, it's an honor for me to present Palestine today and [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2305.0800000000004s)]
*  these proceedings at a time of existential crisis for the Palestinian people and for [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2316.84s)]
*  the rule of international law. On behalf of Palestine's delegation, I wish to congratulate [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2324.2000000000003s)]
*  you, Mr President, on your election as President of the Court and to wish you success in your [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2331.0s)]
*  tenure. Allow me also to express our gratitude to the Court's holding these hearings on an [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2337.76s)]
*  expedited basis. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2344.12s)]
*  As I address you today, the Palestinian people are being starved, bombed, and forcibly displaced [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2347.68s)]
*  by Israel, their unlawful occupier. Israel has not allowed food, water, medicine, and [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2355.12s)]
*  medical supplies or fuel into Gaza for the past two months, a policy supported by the [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2364.2799999999997s)]
*  highest court in Israel, which rejected petitions to allow aid into Gaza on several occasions. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2372.88s)]
*  This man-made catastrophe of unprecedented proportions targets life itself. Death looms [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2381.4s)]
*  large, including by starvation, which has already claimed the lives of 59 Palestinian [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2389.92s)]
*  children. The UN Secretary General has described Gaza as a killing field, where civilians are [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2397.88s)]
*  in an endless death loop. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2406.76s)]
*  Mr President, we are here today because the General Assembly asked the Court to determine [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2410.96s)]
*  the legal obligations of Israel in relation to the provision of urgently needed humanitarian [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2418.6s)]
*  assistance by the United Nations, other international organizations, and third states, and in relation [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2423.56s)]
*  to the exercise of the right of Palestinian people to self-determination. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2432.4s)]
*  This request was provoked by the international community's outrage at Israel's methodical [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2439.64s)]
*  targeting, banning, and obstructing of said parties, including its legislation, which [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2445.52s)]
*  banning the United Nations Relief and Works Agency of Palestinian Refugees, UNRWA, from [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2453.88s)]
*  fulfilling its UN mandate in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2460.44s)]
*  There can be no doubt about the Court's jurisdiction in these proceedings. The question raised [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2466.44s)]
*  by the General Assembly is plainly a legal one. It specifically asks the Court to advise [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2473.72s)]
*  on Israel's legal obligations under international law and other rules of international law. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2481.08s)]
*  Nor is there any reason, let alone a compelling one, for the Court to decline to answer it, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2486.7999999999997s)]
*  as the Court has already determined in two prior advisory opinions. The question of Palestine [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2494.4399999999996s)]
*  is fundamental to the United Nations and its mandate in this case. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2500.64s)]
*  This request was provoked by the international community's... during this presentation, the [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2506.16s)]
*  state of Palestine will present evidence on the devastating intermediate and long-term [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2513.6s)]
*  consequences of this unlawful Israeli policy on Palestine and its people, on every aspect [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2518.92s)]
*  of their fundamental rights and continued existence. The state of Palestine will also [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2526.16s)]
*  present the Court how Israel's prohibited conduct extends to the occupied West Bank, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2532.6s)]
*  including East Jerusalem, because the target of these actions, by admission of top Israeli [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2540.2s)]
*  leaders, is the permanent annexation of the Palestinian territory and the ethnic cleansing [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2546.72s)]
*  of Palestinians. It is a self-incriminating admission that debunks the security sham they [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2552.68s)]
*  used to justify their genocide, as we will also demonstrate in our presentation. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2560.68s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, before I go any further, allow me to first address [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2569.68s)]
*  the context in which these deliberations are happening. This legal and moral crisis is [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2576.68s)]
*  not 18 months old. Israel has been systematically dispossessing, uprooting, slaughtering and [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2584.2799999999997s)]
*  imprisoning Palestinians in absolute flagrant disregard for international law and the inalienable [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2593.2s)]
*  rights of the Palestinian people for eight years now. It has done so with the intent [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2599.52s)]
*  to destroy our people and to thwart the realization of self-determination in their homeland. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2606.2799999999997s)]
*  To implement this policy, Israel has waged a relentless campaign of erasure against Palestinian [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2613.7999999999997s)]
*  people, their demography, their material presence, their national identity, their history and [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2623.0s)]
*  heritage and their very humanity. This campaign of erasure was a central hallmark of the [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2630.2s)]
*  Nakba that started in 1947 and whose darkest chapter yet, unfolding before our eyes, endures. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2638.2s)]
*  On three separate occasions in the past years, the Court issued provisional measures ordering [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2648.8799999999997s)]
*  Israel, among other things, to ensure and facilitate the unimpeded flow of humanitarian [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2654.96s)]
*  assistance into Gaza. Israel did not comply. On 19 July 2024, this Court also ruled that [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2661.44s)]
*  Israel's presence in and control over the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2670.6400000000003s)]
*  and must come to an end. The Court also ruled that despite the illegality of the occupation [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2678.44s)]
*  regime, Israel was still bound by its obligations under international law as an occupying state. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2684.7200000000003s)]
*  Israel was not a state that had any underlying power. These obligations include ensuring [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2691.36s)]
*  the welfare of the protected civilians. Israel defied this ruling and the rule of law, brazenly [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2699.36s)]
*  declaring instead its official policy of annexing the occupied Palestinian territory, forcibly [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2706.36s)]
*  displacing Palestinian people, weaponizing food and humanitarian aid, and negating refugee [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2713.4s)]
*  rights, including by banning UNRWA. On 21 November 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2719.4s)]
*  for the Prime Minister of Israel and now his former Minister of War, in part because they [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2729.44s)]
*  intentionally deprived the civilian population in Gaza of food, water, medicine, and other [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2735.2000000000003s)]
*  essentials. To summarize, Israel is an unlawful occupying power, standing trial for genocide. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2743.2s)]
*  Its Prime Minister is wanted by the ICC. It's attempting to destroy Palestinian people and [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2753.12s)]
*  erase Palestine, including by barring and obstructing humanitarian organization, thus [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2759.12s)]
*  also violating its obligations under the UN Charter and other instruments of international [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2765.72s)]
*  law. That is the context of the question before you. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2772.24s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the court, UNICEF says Israel's onslaught has killed and injured [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2779.24s)]
*  100 Palestinian children in Gaza every day since 18 March 2025. This is in addition to [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2786.52s)]
*  the more than 15,000 children Israel has killed since the onset of genocide and the thousands [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2794.52s)]
*  who are still missing under tons of piling rubble of what was once their schools and [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2800.52s)]
*  their homes. Israel's genocidal campaign has turned Gaza into the home of the largest [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2807.56s)]
*  cohort of child imputees per capita in the world. Their limbs are imputed without proper [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2814.6s)]
*  medicine or care, sometimes without so much as a painkiller. Many don't survive like [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2822.4s)]
*  Baby Sham M'harib, whose arm was amputated following a strike on her home 18 days ago. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2832.36s)]
*  Israel's genocidal campaign has also targeted UN and other humanitarian workers and organizations [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2841.88s)]
*  in Gaza, killing over 408 UN workers, among them almost 300 UNRWA staff. They have also [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2847.0s)]
*  killed 27 Palestinian Red Crescent Society paramedics in Gaza and 113 civilian civil [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2855.84s)]
*  defense first responders. These killings are deliberate, not accidental. This was proven [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2864.68s)]
*  repeatedly, including in January 2024, when Israeli soldiers killed six-year-old Hind [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2872.68s)]
*  Rajab and her relatives, then murdered the Palestinian Red Crescent paramedic who received [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2878.68s)]
*  permission to rescue Hind while she was still alive. It was proven once more last March [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2884.68s)]
*  when Israeli soldiers ambushed and killed 14 paramedics and humanitarian heroes. The [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2892.16s)]
*  soldiers then buried the bodies in a shallow mass grave alongside with their crushed ambulances [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2899.16s)]
*  and emergencies in an attempt to hide their crime, while top Israeli officials lied to [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2906.56s)]
*  the world about the murders. This is the jarring equation prompting our appeals to the court [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2912.56s)]
*  and these proceedings. Israel is starving, and we are not ready to accept this. We are [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2920.6s)]
*  killing and displacing Palestinians, while also targeting and blocking humanitarian organizations [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2929.3199999999997s)]
*  trying to save their lives. These grave crimes aim to hasten the forcible transfer and destruction [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2936.3199999999997s)]
*  of Palestinian people in the immediate term. They will also ensure that our children will [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2946.56s)]
*  suffer irreparable damage and harm, placing an entire generation at grave risk. Already [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2953.7599999999998s)]
*  experts have concluded that life expectancy in Gaza has been slashed in half since the [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2961.72s)]
*  onset of the genocide. Mr. President, members of the court, this targeting of life in the [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2968.56s)]
*  Gaza Strip has been ongoing for years, and in grave violation of Israel's legal obligation [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2977.12s)]
*  as an occupying power and as a member of the UN. Israel began engineering food deprivation [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2983.08s)]
*  in Gaza 19 years ago, making the majority of civilian population dependent on food aid [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2990.1s)]
*  to survive. A senior Israeli official then said, and I quote, the idea is to put the [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=2997.88s)]
*  Palestinians on diet, but not to make them die of hunger and food. Still, the Israeli [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3005.44s)]
*  office has been trying to make the situation worse. Since October 2023, the blockade has [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3013.08s)]
*  progressively turned into a total siege. The office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3020.08s)]
*  said, this siege is creating conditions that were incompatible with sustaining life or [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3025.08s)]
*  the continued existence of Palestinians in Gaza. These are the facts. Starvation is here. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3033.08s)]
*  The UN is being used as a weapon of war. All UN-supported bakeries in Gaza have been forced [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3040.08s)]
*  to shut their doors. Nine of every 10 Palestinians have no access to safe drinking water. Storage [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3047.08s)]
*  facilities of the UN and other international agencies are empty. More than 12,500 wounded [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3055.08s)]
*  Palestinians, including thousands of children, now require medical evacuation to have a [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3062.08s)]
*  chance at life. That is in addition to thousands of cancer and other patients dying slowly, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3069.08s)]
*  dying in agony, and hundreds of thousands of children whose lives are in danger because [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3079.08s)]
*  Israel is denying entry of vaccines. Meanwhile, Israel continues to repeatedly, forcibly, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3086.08s)]
*  displace and starve the Palestinian population in Gaza. This UN-produced map illustrates [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3095.08s)]
*  how Israel has squeezed the population into a third of the Gaza Strip, that it continues [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3102.08s)]
*  also to bolster the Palestinian population. The UN has also been using the UN's strategy [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3108.08s)]
*  to bomb. UNICEF, for example, has been forced to shut down 21 malnutrition clinics because [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3116.08s)]
*  of these repeated forced displacement orders. Israel has also waged a war on hospitals [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3124.08s)]
*  in Gaza, bombing them, laying siege to them, burning them, or leveling them to the ground. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3132.08s)]
*  Israel has bombed and attacked all 36 hospitals in Gaza. The last hospital to be bombed was [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3139.08s)]
*  Gaza's Al Ahly Baptist Hospital, an institution that has offered health to Palestinians since [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3146.08s)]
*  1882. This hospital survived two world wars and many wars after, but Israel decommissioned [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3153.08s)]
*  it twice in the past 18 months. Israeli occupation forces have killed over 1,400 doctors, nurses, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3160.08s)]
*  and other health workers, some like renowned surgeons Adnan El-Borsh and Yad Ramtisi, who [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3171.08s)]
*  were forcibly disappeared and tortured to death. Others, like Director of Al Awda Hospital, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3178.08s)]
*  Dr. Ahmad Mohanna, was forcibly disappeared for over a year now, while Director of Kamal [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3186.08s)]
*  Adwan Hospital, Hussam Abu Safi continues to be unlawfully detained. Only a handful of [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3195.08s)]
*  hospitals continue to bravely function thanks to the heroic Palestinian doctors who remain [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3203.08s)]
*  and the brave international doctors volunteering to assist them despite the dangers and severe [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3210.08s)]
*  Israeli restrictions. To understand what this means in real, bone-chilling terms, I ask [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3216.08s)]
*  you hear this brief testimony of Dr. Mohammad Mustafa, an Australian doctor who was volunteering [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3223.08s)]
*  in Gaza last March. We've worked throughout the entire night. We haven't stopped. We've [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3230.08s)]
*  been, the bombing has been nonstop. We've run out of ketamine. We've run out of propofol. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3239.08s)]
*  We've run out of all painkillers. We can't sedate anyone. We can't give them any analgesia. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3246.6s)]
*  When we intubate people, they wake up and they're choking because we have no sedation. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3253.6s)]
*  There are seven girls getting their legs amputated, no anesthesia. The bombing is still going [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3260.3199999999997s)]
*  on. The room is still shaking. I haven't slept. We went to bed at about 1 o'clock [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3266.64s)]
*  and at 1.30 the bombing started. It's about 10 a.m. now. We've just gone back to my room. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3271.64s)]
*  I'm lightheaded. I'm dizzy. I mean, it's just mostly women and children, burnt head to toe, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3277.48s)]
*  limbs missing, heads missing. You know, there's a video I put up on my phone. I was like, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3287.4s)]
*  what's the last story of me doing the chest drain? The gentleman that did the chest drain [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3296.64s)]
*  and he died on the way to the CT scan. There's another video of three girls laying on a bed. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3300.4s)]
*  That's his three girls who are now orphaned. Their mother didn't even make it into the [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3305.56s)]
*  hospital. She was killed along with their other sister. I don't know what to tell you. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3310.8799999999997s)]
*  I was here in June. Nothing to this intensity. This is unbelievable. And the bombing is still [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3318.64s)]
*  going on. The rooms are still shaking. The screams are everywhere. It is insane. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3325.36s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the court, the carnage and destruction extends to the West Bank, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3336.96s)]
*  including East Jerusalem. There, Israel's killing of Palestinian civilians, including [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3343.96s)]
*  children, was record breaking for three years in a row before 2023. Since the beginning [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3350.44s)]
*  of the year, Israel launched a military assault on the West Bank, unprecedented since 1967. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3358.2799999999997s)]
*  Israeli occupation have demolished, raised, and burned the refugee camps in Jenin and [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3365.7599999999998s)]
*  Tul Karem, forcibly displacing more than 40,000 Palestinians. And Israel has announced that [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3371.3599999999997s)]
*  the displaced will not be allowed to return. The World Food Program reports a near 100 [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3380.08s)]

*  and activities of the UN and international organizations must be viewed in the context [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3393.56s)]
*  of erasure and false displacement. Mr. President, members of the court, before [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3400.8799999999997s)]
*  you today, on behalf of the persecuted people, fighting to survive, to live freely in our [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3410.3199999999997s)]
*  land. This is our inalienable and most fundamental right. It is not anyone to give or withhold [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3420.2799999999997s)]
*  as this court has repeatedly affirmed. That's really the heart of why Palestine and over [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3429.72s)]
*  40 other states are addressing the court today. It is not about the number of aid trucks Israel [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3436.56s)]
*  is or is not allowing into the occupied Palestinian territories, especially Gaza. It is not about [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3442.92s)]
*  Israel destroying the fundamentals of life in Palestine while it blocks UN and other [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3452.6s)]
*  humanitarians from providing life-saving aid to the population. It is about Israel unraveling [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3459.6s)]
*  fundamental principles of international law, including their obligations under the UN Charter. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3465.68s)]
*  It is about Israel turning Palestine, and particularly Gaza, into a mass grave for Palestinians [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3472.64s)]
*  and those coming to their aid. Before I conclude, Mr. President, allow me to describe the remainder [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3480.72s)]
*  of Palestine's presentation today. First, Mr. Paul Reichler will present Israel's legal [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3488.52s)]
*  obligations under international law and international humanitarian law. Next, Ms. Blinne Negroli [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3496.52s)]
*  will discuss Israel's violation of its legal obligations as a member of the United Nations. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3505.52s)]
*  Then, Professor Ardinezis will address legal obligations specifically in relation to UNRWA. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3512.52s)]
*  He will also be followed by Professor Alam Pley, who will discuss the legal consequences [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3519.52s)]
*  of Israel's violations of its obligations with respect to the provision of humanitarian [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3525.52s)]
*  aid to the Palestinian civilian population and the exercise of their right to self-determination. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3531.32s)]
*  Finally, Ambassador Riyad Mansour will present the State of Palestine's closing remarks. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3537.32s)]
*  I thank you for your kind attention and ask that you call Mr. Reichler to the podium. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3545.52s)]
*  I thank Ambassador Hijazi. I now give the floor to Mr. Paul Reichler. Sir, you have [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3550.52s)]
*  the floor. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3558.7200000000003s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, It is, as always, an honor for me to appear before [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3561.72s)]
*  you and it is a privilege to speak on behalf of the State of Palestine. And on behalf of [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3574.9199999999996s)]
*  all of my fellow Council here as part of the delegation, we are pleased to echo the congratulations [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3583.12s)]
*  that were conveyed to you by our agent on your election as President. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3592.04s)]
*  I will address Israel's legal obligations under international humanitarian law concerning [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3597.64s)]
*  the provision of humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian civilian population and then [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3604.3199999999997s)]
*  Israel's legal obligations under the rules of international law set out in the Court's [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3610.2s)]
*  advisory opinion of 19 July 2024. I will conclude with some observations on Israel's [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3615.84s)]
*  legal obligations under overlapping rules of international humanitarian law and international [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3625.08s)]
*  criminal law. I begin with an update on the situation on the ground. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3632.1600000000003s)]
*  On 1 March 2025, Israel announced that it would unilaterally end the six-week ceasefire [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3639.16s)]
*  that had prevailed since mid-January and that it would resume aerial bombardment and other [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3650.0s)]
*  armed attacks against Gaza. On the following day, 2 March, the Office of the Prime Minister [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3656.08s)]
*  made this announcement. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided that as of this morning, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3664.0s)]
*  the entry of all goods and supplies to the Gaza Strip will be halted. The Prime Minister's [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3672.6s)]
*  decision immediately cut off all humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian civilian population [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3681.12s)]
*  in Gaza. This was underscored by the head of Israel's Civil Administration for the [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3688.7599999999998s)]
*  Occupied Territory and Minister of Finance, Bezalel Smotrich, in another post on the same [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3694.2799999999997s)]
*  day. The decision we made last night to completely halt humanitarian aid to Gaza until Hamas [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3701.12s)]
*  is destroyed or completely surrenders and all our hostages are returned is an important [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3710.48s)]
*  step in the right direction, the threshold of the gates of hell. Now we need to open [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3716.22s)]
*  those gates as quickly and lethally as possible on the cruel enemy until absolute victory. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3722.4199999999996s)]
*  Israel's Minister of Defense, Israel Katz, made clear that the cruel enemy was not just [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3731.8599999999997s)]
*  Hamas but the entire civilian population of Gaza. He addressed this message in a letter [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3739.18s)]
*  specifically to them. Citizens of Gaza, this is your last warning. The Air Force attack [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3746.74s)]
*  against Hamas terrorists was only the first step. The rest will be significantly worse [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3755.22s)]
*  and you will pay the price. Unless all the Israeli hostages are released and Hamas is [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3762.3399999999997s)]
*  expelled from Gaza, Israel will act with forces never before seen. The alternative is utter [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3768.7s)]
*  destruction and devastation. In keeping with these official Israeli statements, all humanitarian [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3776.18s)]
*  assistance intended for the civilian population of Gaza has been blocked by Israel since 2 [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3783.98s)]
*  March. No food, no water, no medicine, no fuel, no anything. For 57 days and still counting, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3791.1s)]
*  Israel has prevented all goods and services of any kind from entering Gaza. On 9 March, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3798.1s)]
*  Israel's Energy Minister, Eli Cohen, posted a picture of himself on the social media platform [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3806.9s)]
*  X signing an order to cut off electricity to Gaza. The message accompanying the photo [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3812.9s)]
*  read, I have now signed an order to cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip. I have now [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3819.42s)]
*  cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip immediately. Enough with the talk. It's time for action. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3826.42s)]
*  The impact of this action was to shut down the lone desalination plant in Gaza, depriving [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3835.1s)]
*  more than 600,000 Palestinians of their only access to water. Overall, the consequences [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3842.7000000000003s)]
*  for the Palestinian civilian population, especially the deprivation of urgently needed [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3849.7s)]
*  humanitarian assistance, have been as promised by Defense Minister Katz, utter destruction [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3855.7s)]
*  and devastation. According to the United Nations Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3860.7s)]
*  who briefed the Security Council on 18 March, today I am pleased to announce that the United [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3867.7s)]
*  States has cut off the entry of all life-saving supplies for 2.1 million people. This total [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3874.7s)]
*  blockade of life-saving aid and basic commodities has been a huge threat to the security system [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3890.18s)]
*  and to the people of Gaza who remain dependent on a steady flow of assistance into the Strip. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3898.18s)]
*  Blocking food, water and medicine for people who need them is unconscionable. It also goes [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3906.18s)]
*  against international humanitarian law and the international law of human rights. The [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3914.18s)]
*  international law of human rights is unconscionable. It also goes against international humanitarian [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3921.18s)]
*  law and the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3928.18s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Court, the Under Secretary General is plainly right. The facts [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3936.18s)]
*  on which his statement is based are not in dispute. As you have seen, they are admitted, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3942.18s)]
*  by Israel's most senior government officials. Nor can there be any dispute about the applicable [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3951.18s)]
*  law. In its July 2024 advisory opinion, the Court explained that international humanitarian [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3958.18s)]
*  law governs Israel's conduct in the OPT for as long as its occupation continues. Israel [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3965.18s)]
*  must thus comply with its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention, of which it [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3972.4199999999996s)]
*  is a state party, and additional protocol 1, the relevant articles of which are part [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3977.86s)]
*  of customary international law. The indisputable evidence shows that Israel has flagrantly [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3983.1s)]
*  violated these obligations. They include, first, the obligation under Article 55 of [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3989.78s)]
*  the Fourth Geneva Convention to ensure, to the fullest extent of the means available, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=3997.26s)]
*  the provision of, quote, the food and medical supplies of the population. Under this article, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4004.26s)]
*  Israel has an affirmative duty to, quote, bring in the necessary foodstuffs, medical [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4011.26s)]
*  stores, and other articles if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4018.5s)]
*  which is undeniably the case throughout the Gaza Strip. Article 69 of Additional Protocol [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4024.94s)]
*  1 further requires Israel to ensure the provision of, quote, clothing, bedding, means of shelter, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4031.98s)]
*  and other supplies essential to the survival of the civilian population of the occupied [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4039.42s)]
*  territory. Second, Israel has the obligation under Article 56 of the Convention to ensure [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4045.1s)]
*  and maintain, to the fullest extent of the means available to it, quote, the medical [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4053.14s)]
*  and hospital establishments and services, public health and hygiene in the occupied [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4059.06s)]
*  territory. Article 56 further provides, quote, medical personnel of all categories shall [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4064.9399999999996s)]
*  be allowed to carry out their duties. Israel has been blatantly violating these obligations [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4073.7799999999997s)]
*  and not only since 2 March. It has been violating them for many years, most of which has been [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4081.5s)]
*  agreed to since October 2023. On 9 October 2023, Israel announced a complete siege of [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4088.74s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, cutting off essential resources and the movement of goods, including food, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4099.099999999999s)]
*  water, medicines, fuel, and electricity. All crossing points between Israel and the Gaza [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4105.099999999999s)]
*  Strip were sealed. Israel's Defense Minister at the time, Yoav Galant, described the situation [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4111.38s)]
*  as his government's strategy in these terms, quote, a complete siege, no electricity, no [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4119.0599999999995s)]
*  water, no food, no fuel. The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4126.0599999999995s)]
*  found that this was precisely what Israel did, quote, throughout the siege on Gaza, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4133.86s)]
*  Israel has weaponized the withholding of life-sustaining necessities, specifically by cutting off [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4141.86s)]
*  supplies of water, food, electricity, fuel, and other essential supplies, including humanitarian [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4149.38s)]
*  assistance. On 6 December 2023, the Secretary General reported to the Security Council, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4157.139999999999s)]
*  we are facing a severe risk of collapse of the humanitarian system. The situation is [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4164.14s)]
*  fast deteriorating into a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4171.740000000001s)]
*  Palestinians as a whole and for peace and security in the region. In response, the Security [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4179.5s)]
*  Council adopted Resolution 2720 on 27 December. The Security Council adopted Resolution 2720 [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4186.5s)]
*  on 22 December 2023, which recognized that the civilian population in the Gaza Strip [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4194.22s)]
*  must have access to sufficient quantities of assistance that they need, including enough [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4201.860000000001s)]
*  food, water, sanitation, electricity, telecommunications, and medical services essential for their survival. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4208.860000000001s)]
*  And that the provision of humanitarian supplies in the Gaza Strip needs to be sufficient to [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4217.42s)]
*  alleviate the massive humanitarian needs of the Palestinian civilian population throughout [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4223.42s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. And the Resolution reaffirmed the obligations of the parties to the conflict [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4230.22s)]
*  under international humanitarian law regarding the provision of humanitarian assistance. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4237.88s)]
*  And it demanded that they allow, facilitate, and enable the immediate, safe, and unhindered [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4244.4s)]
*  delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale, directly to the Palestinian civilian population [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4251.799999999999s)]
*  throughout the Gaza Strip. Israel ignored the Security Council's demand, just as it [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4259.36s)]
*  disregarded subsequent Security Council resolutions 2728 and 2735 adopted in 2024, and five General [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4268.759999999999s)]
*  Assembly Emergency Special Session resolutions which called on it again to allow and facilitate [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4275.76s)]
*  urgently needed humanitarian assistance at scale to the Palestinian civilian population [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4284.4800000000005s)]
*  in Gaza. In fact, Israel did the opposite of what was demanded to it. It continued to [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4291.56s)]
*  impede the provision of humanitarian goods and services indispensable to the survival [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4298.56s)]
*  of the Palestinian people. And it restricted humanitarian access by United Nations agencies, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4304.56s)]
*  other states, and international humanitarian organizations. The Court needs no reminding [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4311.8s)]
*  that Israel also disregarded its orders on provisional measures, and that Israel did [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4318.8s)]
*  also disregarded its orders on provisional measures in the case brought by South Africa, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4325.8s)]
*  which were issued on 26 January, 28 March, and 24 May, 2024. Israel was required by the [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4332.0s)]
*  March order to take all necessary and effective measures to ensure, without delay, in full [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4340.76s)]
*  cooperation with the United Nations, the unhindered provision at scale by all concerned of urgently [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4348.76s)]
*  needed basic services and humanitarian assistance, including food, water, electricity, fuel, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4357.76s)]
*  shelter, clothing, hygiene and sanitation requirements, as well as medical supplies [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4364.76s)]
*  and medical care to Palestinians throughout Gaza, including by increasing the capacity [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4369.76s)]
*  and number of land crossing points and maintaining them open for as long as necessary. Israel [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4376.16s)]
*  has ignored these obligations and refused to comply. By May 2024, the Court recognized [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4384.400000000001s)]
*  that, quote, the humanitarian situation is now to be characterized as disastrous, as [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4391.400000000001s)]
*  indeed it was, and the situation grew even worse thereafter. On 28 October 2024, the [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4398.4s)]
*  Commissioner General of UNRWA made this report to the General Assembly. The situation in [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4410.4s)]
*  Gaza is beyond the diplomatic vocabulary of the General Assembly. The situation in Gaza [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4419.4s)]
*  is beyond the diplomatic vocabulary of the General Assembly. After more than a year [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4428.4s)]
*  of the most intense bombardment of a civilian population since World War II and the restriction [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4435.4s)]
*  of humanitarian aid far below minimum needs, the lives of Palestinians are shattered. The [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4443.4s)]
*  population lives in the greatest indignity in the North. The population is trapped, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4450.4s)]
*  awaiting death by airstrikes or starvation. On 2 December 2024, the Secretary General [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4458.4s)]
*  reported to the Cairo Ministerial Conference, nothing justifies the collective punishment [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4467.4s)]
*  of the Palestinian people. Collective punishment is, of course, prohibited by Article 33 of [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4474.4s)]
*  the Fourth Geneva Convention. Secretary General continued, yet conditions for Palestinians [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4479.4s)]
*  in Gaza are appalling and apocalyptic. Malnutrition is rampant. Famine is imminent. Meanwhile, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4487.4s)]
*  the health system has collapsed. What we are seeing may well amount to the gravest international [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4498.4s)]
*  crimes. In the face of the gigantic needs, humanitarian aid is outrageously being blocked. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4506.4s)]
*  This flies in the face of the clear requirements under international humanitarian law to respect [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4515.4s)]
*  and to protect civilians and to ensure their essential needs are met. It defies numerous [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4521.4s)]
*  General Assembly and Security Council resolutions demanding a ceasefire and unhinged, unresolved [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4528.4s)]
*  humanitarian access. And it ignores the International Court of Justice, which issued binding provisional [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4535.4s)]
*  orders that must be complied with. As appalling and apocalyptic as the situation was in December, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4542.4s)]
*  it is even worse today. The Secretary General recognized this in a statement on 8 April. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4554.4s)]
*  More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food, no fuel, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4565.4s)]
*  no medicine, no commercial supplies. As aid has dried up, the floodgates of horror have [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4573.4s)]
*  reopened. Gaza is a killing field, and civilians are in an endless death loop. The current [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4582.4s)]
*  path is a dead end, totally intolerable in the eyes of international law and history. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4590.4s)]
*  And the risk of the occupied West Bank transforming into another Gaza makes it even worse. Mr. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4597.4s)]
*  President, in these circumstances, there can be no doubt that Israel is violating its obligations [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4605.4s)]
*  under international humanitarian law, including its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4610.4s)]
*  and customary international law, as reflected in Additional Protocol 1. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4617.4s)]
*  In its written statement, Israel argues that its defense and security concerns justify [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4625.4s)]
*  its refusal to allow humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian civilian population, no [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4633.4s)]
*  matter how urgently this assistance is needed. This posture is as unlawful as it is inhumane. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4641.4s)]
*  Under Article 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as pointed out by the distinguished Under [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4652.4s)]
*  Secretary General for Legal Affairs earlier this morning, quote, if the whole or part [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4660.4s)]
*  of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the occupying power [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4667.4s)]
*  shall agree to release schemes on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4675.4s)]
*  them by all the means at its disposal. The ICRC commentary on Article 59 explains, the [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4684.4s)]
*  obligation on the occupying power to accept such relief is unconditional. In all cases [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4691.4s)]
*  where occupied territory is inadequately supplied, the occupying power is bound to accept relief [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4698.4s)]
*  supplies destined for the population. The Convention not only lays down that the occupying [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4706.4s)]
*  power must agree to release schemes on behalf of the population, but insists that the occupying [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4712.4s)]
*  power must facilitate them by all the means at its disposal. The occupation authorities [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4718.4s)]
*  must therefore cooperate wholeheartedly in the rapid and scrupulous execution of these [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4727.4s)]
*  schemes. Article 59 itself further provides, quote, all contracting parties shall permit [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4735.4s)]
*  the free passage of these consignments and shall guarantee their protection. The ICRC [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4743.4s)]
*  commentary explains that these obligations apply to any state that is enforcing a blockade, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4751.4s)]
*  and it specifies that the consignments, quote, cannot under any circumstances be declared [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4758.4s)]
*  war contraband or be seized as such by those enforcing the blockade. Mr. President, the [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4766.4s)]
*  question posed by the General Assembly calls for the Court to issue an opinion on Israel's [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4774.4s)]
*  legal obligations, and I quote, to ensure and facilitate the unhindered provision of [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4779.4s)]
*  urgently needed supplies essential to the supply of the Palestinian civilian population, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4785.4s)]
*  as well as of basic services and humanitarian and development assistance. This question [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4792.4s)]
*  assumes that the relief consignments are humanitarian in nature. As such, international humanitarian [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4798.4s)]
*  law does not permit Israel to deprive the Palestinian civilian population of such assistance [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4806.4s)]
*  for any reason, including what it claims are its defense or security requirements. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4814.4s)]
*  This is the conclusion reached by the ICRC itself. In relation to the current situation [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4822.4s)]
*  in Gaza, the ICRC has stated, the suspension of assistance now, including the cessation [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4828.4s)]
*  of power to the only water desalinization facility in Gaza, risks plunging Gaza further [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4837.4s)]
*  into an acute humanitarian emergency. Under international humanitarian law, Israel shall [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4845.4s)]
*  ensure that the basic needs of civilians under its control are met. The rapid and unimpeded [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4852.4s)]
*  passage of humanitarian assistance must also be allowed and facilitated. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4859.4s)]
*  I now turn to Israel's legal obligations under the rules of international law applied [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4867.4s)]
*  by the Court in its 2024 advisory opinion. I refer specifically to the Court's determinations [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4875.4s)]
*  that Israel has no sovereignty and may not exercise sovereign powers in the occupied [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4883.4s)]
*  Palestinian territory, and that its presence there is unlawful, such that it must be terminated [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4887.4s)]
*  as rapidly as possible. I refer as well to the Court's determination that Israel has [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4893.4s)]
*  an obligation to facilitate and not to impede the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4898.4s)]
*  including the right to a sovereign and independent state in the occupied Palestinian territory, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4905.4s)]
*  and that Israel, by its presence in this territory, its annexations and its settlements, among [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4910.4s)]
*  other actions, has been systematically violating that obligation. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4916.4s)]
*  The Court further determined that third states and the United Nations are legally obligated [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4922.4s)]
*  not to accept the Israeli presence in the OPT as lawful, or to contribute to its maintenance, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4927.4s)]
*  and must work to bring it to an end, and that they have an ergo omnis obligation to support [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4934.4s)]
*  the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. These determinations by the Court have at least [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4939.4s)]
*  three inevitable consequences for the present proceedings. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4946.4s)]
*  First, because its presence in the OPT is unlawful and it lacks sovereign rights or [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4950.4s)]
*  powers within the territory, Israel has no legal authority to impede humanitarian goods [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4956.4s)]
*  and services from entering or circulating within the Gaza Strip or any other part of [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4962.4s)]
*  Palestinian territory. The decision to accept and receive humanitarian assistance, and from [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4967.4s)]
*  whom, is an exercise of sovereignty, which in the case of the Palestinian territory belongs [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4973.4s)]
*  exclusively to the Palestinian people, who are represented by the state of Palestine. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4979.4s)]
*  Accordingly, in addition to its obligations to ensure and facilitate the provision of [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4985.4s)]
*  humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian civilian population under international humanitarian [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4991.4s)]
*  law, Israel bears an obligation under general international law not to override the sovereign [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=4997.4s)]
*  will of the Palestinian people, expressed through their legitimate governmental representative [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5004.4s)]
*  to receive in their own territory such urgently needed assistance and services as they may [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5010.4s)]
*  authorize from the United Nations, third states, and other trusted organizations. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5017.4s)]
*  Second, Israel's prevention of humanitarian assistance from entering Gaza also violates its [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5023.4s)]
*  obligation, in the Court's words, quote, not to impede the Palestinian people from exercising [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5029.4s)]
*  its right of self-determination. As the Court explained, the right of self-determination [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5035.4s)]
*  includes the right to territorial integrity, the right to be protected against acts aimed [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5041.4s)]
*  at dispersing the population and undermining its integrity as a people, and the right of the people [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5048.4s)]
*  freely to determine its political status and to pursue its economic, social, and cultural [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5054.4s)]
*  development, all of which the Court found were violated by Israel's prolonged occupation of Palestinian [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5060.4s)]
*  territory. By preventing humanitarian assistance from entering Palestinian territory, Israel [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5066.4s)]
*  further violates each of these components of the right of self-determination. In particular, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5072.4s)]
*  Israel's denial of food, water, and other essentials of life to the Palestinian civilian [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5078.4s)]
*  population inevitably impedes their economic, social, and cultural development, and it is [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5084.4s)]
*  intended, as Israeli officials themselves proclaim, to displace and disperse the Palestinian [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5090.4s)]
*  population, especially in Gaza, but increasingly in the West Bank as well, which undermines [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5096.4s)]
*  their integrity as a people. Mr. President, I see that the clock is approaching 11.30. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5102.4s)]
*  I have somewhere between five and eight more minutes of my speech remaining. If you allow [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5108.4s)]
*  me to continue, I would be happy to do so. If you prefer to take the call, I will be happy to [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5114.4s)]
*  continue. If you prefer to take the coffee break, obviously that's fine with us. We're [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5120.4s)]
*  entirely in your hands. I think we can have coffee after you finish your remarks. Thank you [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5130.4s)]
*  very much, Mr. President. Israel's prevention of humanitarian assistance also violates the [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5136.4s)]
*  territorial integrity of Palestine, another essential component of self-determination. As shown [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5142.4s)]
*  on this map, in the southwest Gaza borders Egypt, the main border crossing is at Ra'afah, which is [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5148.4s)]
*  where most humanitarian assistance before it was blocked by Israel entered Gaza. Israel [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5154.4s)]
*  enforces its blockade on goods entering here from within Palestinian territory, thus [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5160.4s)]
*  violating its territorial integrity. The situation is similar in the East, where Israeli forces [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5166.4s)]
*  stationed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, prevent or restrict the entry of humanitarian [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5172.4s)]
*  assistance from Jordan via the King Hussein al-Karama bridge crossing, again in violation of Palestinian [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5178.4s)]
*  territorial integrity. As the Secretary General observed, the humanitarian situation in the West [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5184.4s)]
*  Bank, including East Jerusalem, is also grave. The situation in the West Bank is also grave. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5190.4s)]
*  The humanitarian situation in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is also grave [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5196.4s)]
*  due to Israel's prevention or restriction of humanitarian assistance to the millions of [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5202.4s)]
*  Palestinians who live there. While Israel has not announced a formal cutoff of humanitarian [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5208.4s)]
*  assistance to the West Bank, as it has to Gaza, it has imposed major obstacles to the [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5214.4s)]
*  delivery of such assistance, including the arbitrary withdrawal or denial of operating permits [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5220.4s)]
*  for humanitarian organizations. According to the Commissioner General of UNRWA, while a number of [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5226.4s)]
*  international NGOs have already been silenced, there is now a larger concerted effort in Israel [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5232.4s)]
*  to undermine or restrict through legislative measures the operations of international [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5238.4s)]
*  organizations and NGOs. In occupied East Jerusalem, the agency is facing increased [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5244.4s)]
*  pressure from the municipality to vacate premises and end service provision. International staff [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5250.4s)]
*  have been effectively expelled from the occupied West Bank due to the lack of valid visas. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5256.4s)]
*  The vast majority of the states and international organizations participating in these [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5262.4s)]
*  proceedings agree that Israel's shutdown of relief operations and denial of urgently needed [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5268.4s)]
*  humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian civilian population violate its duty not to impede [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5274.4s)]
*  the Palestinian people from exercising their right of self-determination. According to the [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5280.4s)]
*  Netherlands, for example, in a situation of extreme dependence on relief organizations, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5286.4s)]
*  the occupying powers' unilateral decision to terminate its agreement and cooperation [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5292.4s)]
*  with a third party responsible for the bulk of the humanitarian assistance directly and severely [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5298.4s)]
*  affects the people as a whole, frustrating its economic, social and cultural development. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5304.4s)]
*  This has severe negative consequences on the ability to provide relief to the people who [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5310.4s)]
*  are concerned to exercise their right of self-determination. The written statement of the Secretary General [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5316.4s)]
*  explains, quote, the obligation of Israel to respect the right of self-determination of the Palestinian [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5322.4s)]
*  people has another important aspect, to respect the decision of the Palestinian people on the [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5328.4s)]
*  manner in which the dependence of the West Bank on the right of self-determination is not [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5334.4s)]
*  the right of self-determination. The right of self-determination is the right of self-determination. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5340.4s)]
*  The right of self-determination is the right of self-determination. The right of self-determination [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5346.4s)]
*  is the right of self-determination. The right of self-determination is the right of self-determination. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5352.4s)]
*  The right of self-determination is the right of self-determination. The right of self-determination [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5358.4s)]
*  is the right of self-determination. Israel is bound to respect that decision. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5364.4s)]
*  The third consequence of the 2024 advisory opinion is that Israel's prevention of humanitarian [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5370.4s)]
*  assistance from other states and the United Nations violates its duty not to prevent them from [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5384.4s)]
*  fulfilling what the court found to be their ergo omnis obligations to support and facilitate [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5390.4s)]
*  the exercise of self-determination by the Palestinian people. Many states and international [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5396.4s)]
*  organizations emphasize this point. The African Union, for example, explains that as a member [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5402.4s)]
*  state of the international community, Israel must cooperate with third states to ensure that [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5408.4s)]
*  the right to self-determination is the right of self-determination. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5414.4s)]
*  It must therefore grant all facilities at its disposal for the provisions by third states [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5420.4s)]
*  of the support necessary for the latter to be able to self-determine. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5426.4s)]
*  Mr. President, I come now to the final part of my presentation and the briefest part of [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5432.4s)]
*  my presentation and the briefest on Israel's legal obligations under parallel rules of [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5438.4s)]
*  international humanitarian law and international criminal law, particularly those which prohibit [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5444.4s)]
*  starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare. This practice, which Israel, [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5450.4s)]
*  by admission of its legal obligations, has been used to protect the rights of the people [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5456.4s)]
*  and the rights of the people, this practice, which Israel, by admission of its senior government [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5462.4s)]
*  officials, deliberately employs against the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza, is [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5468.4s)]
*  unlawful under both Article 54.1 of Additional Protocol 1, which expressly prohibits it, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5474.4s)]
*  and the Rome Statute, which provides an Article 82.B that, quote, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5480.4s)]
*  intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare by depriving them of objects [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5486.4s)]
*  indispensable to their survival, including willfully impeding relief supplies, is a [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5492.4s)]
*  war crime. In fact, starvation of civilians as a method of warfare has been recognized [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5498.4s)]
*  as a war crime, at least since the judgment of the United States of America. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5506.4s)]
*  Eight decades later, it is Israel that is deliberately starving more than two million Palestinian [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5512.4s)]
*  civilians in Gaza to achieve its purported war ends by cutting off all supplies of food, water, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5518.4s)]
*  and other essentials of life. This has led the International Criminal Court to [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5524.4s)]
*  say that the United States of America should be the first to stop the war crime [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5530.4s)]
*  of starvation. In allowing the prosecution to proceed, the pre-trial chamber of the ICC [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5536.4s)]
*  explained, there are reasonable grounds to believe that both individuals, intentionally [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5542.4s)]
*  and knowingly, deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5548.4s)]
*  The United States of America has been a very important partner in this process, and the [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5554.4s)]

*  stop starvation, or resolve the threat of mass dominating our country. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5571.4s)]
*  On top of this, the Atlantik [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5576.4s)]

*  Its title is, Starvation is Starvation is Starvation. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5594.48s)]
*  People in Gaza are being starved to death, and we are all witnessing it, if not complicit [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5600.879999999999s)]

*  But this human tragedy is a deliberate choice. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5610.16s)]
*  It is the consequence of a political decision. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5614.24s)]

*  have the moral obligation to raise our voices in outcry of this catastrophe and in efforts [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5629.48s)]
*  to stop it. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5636.88s)]
*  Israeli authorities must ensure complete and unfettered access for humanitarian goods throughout [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5638.5599999999995s)]

*  Human dignity simply cannot be held hostage to conflict. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5645.8s)]
*  This must stop. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5651.32s)]
*  The inhumanity of this Israeli policy is compounded by its unlawful objective to forever extinguish [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5654.16s)]
*  the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including a sovereign and independent state [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5661.16s)]

*  demands. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5672.44s)]
*  Mr. President, killing and maiming hundreds of thousands and starving and attempting to [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5674.04s)]
*  displace millions of Palestinians out of Palestine amounts to no less than destroying them as [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5679.2s)]
*  a group. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5687.2s)]
*  In conclusion, the state of Palestine respectfully submits that Israel's unconscionable violations [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5688.36s)]
*  of its legal obligations under international humanitarian law and under the rules of international [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=5694.08s)]

*  members without restriction as to the nature of the action involved or the identity of [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7332.12s)]
*  the United Nations entity taking it, subject to the action being in accordance with the [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7337.44s)]
*  Charter. This is reflected in state practice, including written statements in these proceedings [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7342.32s)]
*  and numerous UN resolutions concerning Palestine. Israel now argues before this Court that the [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7349.0s)]
*  Article 2.5 obligation should be interpreted as restricted to certain limited actions taken [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7356.56s)]
*  by the Security Council, where the United States repeatedly wields its veto to shield [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7362.76s)]
*  Israel from accountability. But Israel interpreted this obligation very differently when being [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7368.36s)]
*  considered for membership in the United Nations. At a meeting of the Committee considering [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7374.68s)]

*  fulfilment of the part of Resolution 194 concerning refugees, end quote. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7394.82s)]
*  Israel has also interpreted the obligation broadly when commending other states for acting [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7402.18s)]
*  as, quote, loyal members of this organisation, end quote, in providing every assistance [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7407.5s)]

*  in its Reparation for Injuries advisory opinion. It emphasised the importance of the duty, [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7428.46s)]

*  underscored, it has been a long-standing position of the Secretariat, I quote, that Member States [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7454.9400000000005s)]

*  the Security Council and General Assembly, underscoring that as a Member of the United [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7472.94s)]

*  to respect the privileges and immunities of UN officials, including salaried Palestinian [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7525.68s)]
*  staff, international staff and experts on UN missions, including fact-finding missions. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7531.86s)]

*  since at least 2009. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7638.339999999999s)]

*  injuring and unlawfully detaining them, and subjecting them to violent interrogation and [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7658.78s)]

*  The Israeli attacks on 23 March 2025 on UN personnel and other aid workers in Raqqa, [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7701.46s)]
*  stand as a stark example. The slide on your screens shows the mangled wreckage of a UN [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7708.86s)]
*  vehicle, crushed by Israeli soldiers and hidden in the sand, buried alongside its murdered [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7716.42s)]
*  driver, a UN employee, and 14 medics and first responders, with their destroyed ambulances [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7722.86s)]
*  and firetruck. They were only recovered six days later, an initial joint UN mission to [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7729.9s)]
*  recover the bodies having been abandoned after, I quote, encountering hundreds of civilians [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7736.58s)]
*  fleeing under gunfire. The acting director of Oce in Gaza described, I quote again, [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7742.62s)]
*  witnessing a woman shot in the back of the head. When a young man tried to retrieve her, [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7750.54s)]
*  he too was shot, end quote. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7756.38s)]
*  As a video recording has exposed, the Israeli army's Golani unit, responsible for the [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7760.26s)]
*  Israeli attacks on 23 March, was briefed prior to its deployment to Raqqa that, I quote, [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7766.22s)]
*  everyone you encounter is an enemy. If you spot a figure, open fire, eliminate and move [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7773.9400000000005s)]
*  on. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7782.38s)]
*  It was the recording of the Israeli attacks on 23 March, found on the mobile phone of [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7785.860000000001s)]
*  a slain Palestinian Red Crescent paramedic, that compelled Israel's retraction of its [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7791.06s)]
*  initial attempted justification of the killings. That recording of Refat Rodawan's final words [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7796.46s)]
*  also reflects the sacrifice made by so many in Gaza who have given their lives for others. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7804.22s)]
*  After reciting the Muslim prayers of the dying and knowing his mother's heart would be broken [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7812.4800000000005s)]
*  by his death, he called out, [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7816.82s)]
*  Forgive me mother, forgive me. I chose this path to help people. Forgive me. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7821.139999999999s)]
*  As stated by the director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, quote, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7829.94s)]
*  The situation in Gaza will haunt us for decades, because no one will be able to say we weren't [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7836.099999999999s)]
*  there. All the information is available. The images are there. End quote. They are being [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7842.42s)]
*  streamed from the phones of the living and the dead. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7849.66s)]
*  All the information is available also of Israel's long-standing violations of the fundamental [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7856.82s)]
*  human rights of Palestinians, which is the third topic to which I now turn. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7861.86s)]
*  Israel's actions, including those long predating October 2023, are an egregious violation of [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7868.06s)]
*  articles 55 and 56 of chapter 9 of the Charter. Through those articles, Israel, quote, [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7874.14s)]
*  pledged to take joint and separate action in cooperation with the United Nations to [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7882.5s)]
*  promote higher standards of living and universal respect for and observance of human rights [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7888.18s)]
*  and fundamental freedoms for all. End quote. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7894.3s)]
*  The obligations to which chapter 9 gives rise are not optional. As the United States explained [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7900.02s)]
*  in its submissions in the South West Africa case, which concerned another situation of [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7907.1s)]
*  occupation of Namibia by apartheid South Africa, I quote, [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7912.02s)]
*  In accordance with chapter 9 of the Charter, States have an obligation to cooperate with [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7917.860000000001s)]
*  the United Nations towards the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms without [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7923.26s)]
*  discrimination for the people of Namibia. End quote. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7930.26s)]
*  The same applies without discrimination to the people of Palestine. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7936.34s)]
*  That is because through the Charter, the people of the United Nations, including Israel, have [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7942.58s)]
*  declared themselves, quote, determined to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7949.0199999999995s)]
*  in the dignity and worth of the human person, and in the equal rights of nations large and [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7955.54s)]
*  small. End quote. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7961.54s)]
*  One of the foundational purposes of the United Nations is, I quote, to achieve international [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7964.86s)]
*  cooperation in solving international problems of a humanitarian character and in promoting [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7970.54s)]
*  and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all, without [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7976.66s)]
*  distinction. End quote. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7982.26s)]
*  International law protects and binds all peoples equally. There are no children of a lesser [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7987.3s)]
*  God. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7995.18s)]
*  Yet for decades Israel has denied and violated with impunity the fundamental human rights [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=7998.82s)]
*  of the Palestinian people in breach of its obligations under the UN Charter and international [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8004.78s)]
*  human rights law, while in parallel preventing attempts by the UN, other organizations and [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8010.219999999999s)]
*  third states to ensure their fulfillment. It has violated the right of Palestinians [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8016.9s)]
*  to development, causing widespread poverty across the occupied Palestinian territory, [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8022.98s)]
*  and forcing large numbers of people into dependence on international assistance. And then it has [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8028.42s)]
*  obstructed that international assistance or destroyed it once provided. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8034.5s)]
*  It has violated the rights of Palestinians to food, to water, to health, to physical [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8041.5s)]
*  integrity, to education, to property, to shelter, and above all else their right to life, including [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8047.02s)]
*  through the system of racial discrimination and apartheid it has imposed. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8054.86s)]
*  The hundreds of thousands of Palestinian men, women and children whom it has imprisoned, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8060.22s)]
*  many without charge or trial, have been particularly severely impacted. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8065.54s)]
*  Israel's violations have been extensively documented by UN bodies and by Palestinian [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8071.820000000001s)]
*  and international NGOs and their breach is recorded by this Court in two previous advisory [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8076.66s)]
*  opinions. However, even as against that standard, Israel's violations since October 2023 have [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8082.14s)]
*  been unprecedented. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8091.02s)]
*  The International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8094.62s)]
*  and former Defence Minister Galant include the crime against humanity of persecution, [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8099.3s)]
*  defined as, I quote, the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8105.34s)]
*  to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8111.4400000000005s)]
*  In addition to the war crime of starvation dealt with in the previous presentation, warrants [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8118.759999999999s)]
*  have also been issued for the crimes against humanity of murder and inhumane acts involving [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8123.96s)]
*  killing and the infliction of great physical or mental suffering or serious injury committed [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8130.0599999999995s)]
*  as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8135.919999999999s)]
*  The ICC pretrial chamber considered, for example, that, I quote, by intentionally limiting [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8142.92s)]
*  or preventing medical supplies and medicine from getting into Gaza, the two individuals [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8148.64s)]
*  are responsible for inflicting great suffering by means of inhumane acts on persons in need [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8154.32s)]
*  of treatment. Doctors were forced to operate on wounded persons and carry out amputations, [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8160.14s)]
*  including on children, without anaesthetics, causing these persons extreme pain and suffering, [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8168.14s)]
*  end quote. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8175.18s)]
*  And almost inconceivably, the situation has deteriorated further since those warrants [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8176.860000000001s)]
*  were issued. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8182.46s)]
*  As of late 2024, the UN had already assessed that local water and food production in Gaza, [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8184.860000000001s)]
*  crops, olive tree orchards, fishing, cattle and poultry farms, had been all but destroyed, [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8192.18s)]
*  as had been essential services, including electricity, water and sewerage, alongside [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8198.98s)]
*  the destruction of bakeries, shops and trade. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8204.46s)]
*  And now, no fuel, no medicine, no food, no water. Nothing has been permitted by Israel [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8209.46s)]
*  to enter Gaza for 57 days. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8216.859999999999s)]
*  Three days ago, on Friday, the UN World Food Programme announced that it had now, I quote, [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8221.859999999999s)]
*  depleted all its food stocks in Gaza. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8229.339999999998s)]
*  Widespread malnutrition, rampant infectious diseases, alongside untreated conditions and [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8235.46s)]
*  the severe mental impact of Israel's assault on Gaza, together with its systematic destruction [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8241.3s)]
*  of 95% of Gaza's hospitals and maternity clinics and its killing of so many of Gaza's [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8247.3s)]
*  medical experts, will impact Palestinians for generations. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8253.3s)]
*  This is not just about Gaza's present, but about its very future. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8259.019999999999s)]
*  And Gaza's future, its approximately one million children, are being impacted particularly [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8264.9s)]
*  severely. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8271.1s)]
*  Children are literally freezing and starving to death. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8273.7s)]
*  They include 79 children, including eight newborn babies, who died during the particularly [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8278.26s)]
*  harsh cold weather of Christmas and New Year gone by. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8283.94s)]
*  Gaza is now home to the largest cohort of child amputees in the world, the largest orphan [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8289.1s)]
*  in modern history, and a whole generation in danger of suffering from stunting, causing [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8294.939999999999s)]
*  irreparable physical and cognitive impairments. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8301.38s)]
*  Over 15,600 children have been killed violently. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8306.3s)]
*  Tens of thousands more of Gaza's children are injured or missing, and many of those [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8312.3s)]
*  surviving are so traumatised that they openly express the wish to die. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8318.26s)]
*  They, like everyone in Gaza, are in desperate, urgent need of assistance, which Israel continues [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8325.7s)]
*  to block. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8331.94s)]
*  As recently warned by the heads of 12 international aid agencies, I quote, [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8334.18s)]
*  Survival itself is now slipping out of reach. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8340.66s)]
*  Israel's acts are not just murderous and inhumane, they are genocidal, as the UN Commission [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8347.300000000001s)]
*  of Inquiry and others have concluded, and as is the near consensus view across the human [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8351.94s)]
*  rights community. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8356.42s)]
*  While the determination of Israel's international responsibility for genocide is a subject of [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8358.5s)]
*  other proceedings before this Court, the risk to the right of Palestinians to be protected [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8363.14s)]
*  from acts of genocide is at issue in these proceedings. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8367.9s)]
*  That is because the Court is being asked to advise on Israel's obligations in relation [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8372.38s)]
*  to the provision of aid and other services to Gaza in the context of a binding determination [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8376.34s)]
*  by a competent organ of the United Nations, being the Court itself, that there exists [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8382.539999999999s)]
*  a real and imminent risk of irreparable prejudice to the right of Palestinians to be protected [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8387.94s)]
*  from acts of genocide, and that Israel must ensure humanitarian aid and basic services [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8392.74s)]
*  in that situation. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8398.34s)]
*  Despite Israel's objections, there is nothing to prevent the Court advising on the obligations [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8401.22s)]
*  flowing from that situation in these proceedings. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8406.46s)]
*  On the contrary, given that what is an issue is at the very least a situation of a risk [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8410.619999999999s)]
*  of a violation of a peremptory norm of an Aragamne's nature, the Court could itself [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8415.22s)]
*  risk failing in the discharge of its judicial functions if it did not declare that there [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8420.62s)]
*  is an obligation, especially upon members of the United Nations, to bring that situation [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8426.42s)]
*  to an end, as the Court underscored in the South West Africa case. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8431.740000000002s)]
*  In the context of what Honourable Commissioner General has called, [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8438.26s)]
*  "'one of the darkest times for our common humanity that we vowed would not happen again''. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8442.1s)]
*  The Court might well consider it particularly important to remind all States again, as it [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8449.18s)]
*  did a year ago in Nicaragua v. Germany, of their international obligations under the [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8454.18s)]
*  Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as well as under [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8459.02s)]
*  other binding rules of international law. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8464.06s)]
*  That brings me to the fourth and penultimate issue, Israel's violations of UN resolutions [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8469.1s)]
*  and the orders of this Court. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8475.460000000001s)]
*  Applying the Court's reasoning in South West Africa, there is no doubt that the four Security [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8479.02s)]
*  Council resolutions addressing the current situation in Gaza are binding decisions pursuant [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8484.82s)]
*  to Article 25 of the Charter, having regard to their subject matter, their imperative [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8491.34s)]
*  language and the discussions leading to them. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8497.220000000001s)]
*  Those discussions include the Secretary-General's exceptional triggering in December 2023 of [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8501.94s)]
*  Article 99 of the Charter, the most powerful tool available to him, permitting him to bring [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8508.18s)]
*  to the Security Council, [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8514.58s)]
*  "'any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security''. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8516.3s)]
*  Israel's continuing failure to comply with those resolutions, with unanimous Resolution [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8526.38s)]
*  2417, which condemns the unlawful denial of humanitarian access to civilian populations, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8531.18s)]
*  and with dozens of other Security Council resolutions since its admission to the United [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8537.580000000002s)]
*  Nations, constitute repeated violations of Charter Article 25, reflecting a fundamental [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8542.1s)]
*  rejection of the Security Council's authority. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8549.1s)]
*  Israel has similarly defied numerous General Assembly resolutions, including those calling [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8553.78s)]
*  for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, setting out the modalities for the implementation [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8558.980000000001s)]
*  of this Court's 2024 Advisory Opinion, and, I quote, [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8564.7s)]
*  "'strongly deploring the continued and total disregard and breaches by the Government of [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8569.42s)]

*  Israel continues to defy Resolution 194 concerning the right of return of Palestinian refugees, [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8581.86s)]
*  with which it unequivocally undertook to comply on being admitted to UN membership, [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8588.7s)]
*  and Resolution ES 1024 demanding that Palestinians displaced during Israel's occupation be allowed [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8594.300000000001s)]
*  to return home, as stipulated by this Court in its 2024 Opinion. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8600.58s)]
*  Israel has also repeatedly violated Charter Article 94-1 by failing to comply with this [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8607.300000000001s)]
*  Court's binding orders in South Africa versus Israel. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8613.82s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister has rejected the Court's authority, asserting that, I quote, [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8619.18s)]
*  "'nobody will stop us, not the Hague, not the axis of evil, and not anybody else''. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8623.98s)]
*  Just 12 days ago its Defence Minister declared, in defiance of this Court's orders, that, [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8631.94s)]
*  I quote, "'Israel's policy is clear and no humanitarian aid is about to enter Gaza''. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8637.94s)]
*  In violation of the Court's order to maintain open land crossing points, in particular the [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8647.18s)]
*  Raffa crossing, previously described by the UN High Commissioner as, quote, [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8652.02s)]
*  "'the symbolic lifeline for 2.3 million people in Gaza'', Israel has closed all crossings [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8657.58s)]

*  into a post-apocalyptic wasteland'. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8673.58s)]
*  The slide on your screens, reflective of the general tenor of Israeli media since at least [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8678.58s)]

*  "'The annihilation of Raffa is complete', alongside an Israeli flag and a flexed bicep'. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8691.58s)]
*  Plans are reportedly underway for Israel to annex 75 square kilometres of Raffa, one fifth [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8701.58s)]
*  of Gaza, to Israel's so-called buffer zone, permanently. This, together with Israel's [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8707.38s)]
*  continuing maritime blockade, cuts Gaza and its people off from direct aid and assistance [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8714.38s)]
*  and from the rest of the world. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8719.66s)]
*  In further violation of the Court's orders, Israel continues to block UN-mandated investigatory [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8722.74s)]
*  bodies from Gaza, while destroying and burying evidence of its crimes. Despite the extraordinary [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8728.82s)]
*  efforts of Palestinian journalists, who are themselves repeatedly targeted and killed, [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8737.66s)]
*  so much remains undocumented. As stated by UNRWA's Commissioner-General, [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8743.66s)]
*  "'I shudder to think of what will still be revealed about the horrors that have taken [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8749.66s)]
*  place in this narrow strip of land.'" [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8755.74s)]
*  Simultaneously, Israel obstructs external investigations. It does so while its officials [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8760.74s)]
*  denounce the UN Commission of Inquiry and the UN Human Rights Council itself as, quote, [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8767.4s)]
*  "'a propaganda mouthpiece for terrorist organisations and anti-Semitic Israel haters engaged in [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8774.4s)]
*  blood libels' and calls for the Council to be, quote, removed from this earth.'" [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8781.32s)]
*  And so to my final submission concerning the principle of good faith, one of the United [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8789.84s)]
*  Nations Bedrock Principles set out in Article 2.2 of the Charter. It provides, [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8795.36s)]
*  "'All Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8802.76s)]
*  from membership, shall fulfil in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8807.92s)]
*  with the present Charter.'" [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8814.199999999999s)]
*  The obligation reaffirmed in the Declaration on Friendly Relations was described by the [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8817.44s)]
*  Court in the nuclear test case as, quote, "'one of the basic principles governing the [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8822.64s)]
*  creation and performance of legal obligations, whatever their source.'" [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8827.76s)]
*  It reflects not only the maxim of pacta sunt servanda, but also that of qui habet commode [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8835.0s)]
*  ferre debit honora. Whomever receives the advantages must also bear the responsibilities. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8842.16s)]
*  Israel is failing to fulfil its Charter responsibilities in good faith. Its violations of the fundamental [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8850.16s)]
*  rights of the Palestinian people, its attacks on the United Nations and on UN officials' [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8858.52s)]
*  property and premises, its deliberate obstruction of the organisation's work and its attempt [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8864.0s)]
*  to destroy an entire UN subsidiary organ are unprecedented in the history of the organisation. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8870.24s)]
*  They evidence a fundamental repudiation by Israel of its Charter obligations, owed both [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8877.28s)]
*  to the organisation and to all UN members, and of the international rule of law. They [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8882.88s)]
*  are antithetical to the actions of a peace-loving state. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8889.44s)]
*  Israel's very submissions to this Court violate its obligations to cooperate with the UN in [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8895.48s)]
*  good faith, advancing allegations for which Israel has persistently failed to provide [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8900.0s)]
*  credible evidence. This is notwithstanding the Secretary-General's call on Israel, [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8905.12s)]
*  quote, to refrain from such misrepresentations, end quote, given how very damaging they are [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8910.12s)]
*  to the United Nations. But for Israeli officials, damage to the United Nations appears to be [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8916.72s)]
*  the point. Their attacks are not limited to UNRWA or indeed the UN Human Rights Council. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8924.32s)]
*  Israel has declared the Secretary-General of the United Nations himself persona non grata [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8931.84s)]
*  in Israel, accusing him of being, quote, an official Hamas spokesperson engaged in anti-Semitic [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8937.44s)]
*  and anti-Israel conduct. Israeli officials demand his resignation, labelling his triggering [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8944.72s)]
*  of Charter Article 99 and his calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, quote, a danger to world [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8952.48s)]
*  peace. Senior Israeli officials level similar accusations that the United Nations itself [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8958.84s)]
*  as an organisation, denouncing it as, quote, a swamp of anti-Semitic bile and accomplice [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8964.960000000001s)]
*  to terrorists and a stain on humanity. Israeli officials have even sought to discredit this [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8971.32s)]
*  Court, calling it, quote, an anti-Semitic Court comprising judges from Muslim dictatorships [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8979.24s)]
*  which has been manipulated and weaponised in the persecution of the Jewish people. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8987.24s)]
*  As stated by UNRWA's Commissioner-General, I quote, the international order is crumbling [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=8995.52s)]
*  in a repetition of the horrors that led to the establishment of the United Nations and [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9002.08s)]
*  in violation of commitments to prevent their occurrence. The attacks on UNRWA are an integral [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9007.48s)]
*  part of this disintegration, end quote. Not stopping at UNRWA, the Israeli ambassador [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9013.56s)]
*  to the United Nations itself has demanded that the entire UN, end quote, its corrupt [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9021.279999999999s)]
*  courts, the ICC and the ICJ, must be defunded, end quote. In addition to seeking to destroy [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9027.76s)]
*  the protective application of international law to the Palestinian people, Israel appears [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9034.960000000001s)]
*  set on destroying the very international framework created to ensure compliance with international [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9039.960000000001s)]
*  law and accountability for its breach, with profound consequences that reverberate far [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9045.960000000001s)]
*  beyond Palestine and Palestinians. If these venerable institutions are to survive, and [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9052.960000000001s)]
*  if in the words of the UN Relief Chief, quote, the basic principles of law still count, the [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9059.96s)]
*  international community must act while it can to uphold them, end quote. Mr President, [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9066.96s)]
*  members of the Court, the international community is so acting in seeking the Court's advice [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9074.96s)]
*  on these matters, having regard to the Court's prior vital unwavering reaffirmation of the [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9079.96s)]
*  international law in its 2024 advisory opinion. Mindful of the former Secretary-General's [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9087.96s)]
*  description of the United Nations as, quote, the hope and home of all humankind, with the [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9094.96s)]
*  Charter at its compass, end quote, the State of Palestine respectfully calls on this Court [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9101.96s)]
*  to provide this further advisory opinion urgently, to reset that compass in the continuing, [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9108.96s)]
*  desperate hope that international law might finally prevail. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9116.96s)]
*  Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les juges, je vous remercie de votre bienveillante [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9123.96s)]
*  attention. Je vous invite à appeler à la barre le Professeur Yimses. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9130.96s)]
*  I thank Ms Nijaly. I now give the floor to Mr Adry Yimses. You have the floor, sir. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9137.96s)]
*  Members of the Court, it is an honour to appear before you today on behalf of the State [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9146.96s)]
*  of Palestine and the Palestinian people. I have been given the task of addressing the [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9151.96s)]
*  issue of ANRA, and to that end I should like to make three points. First, for context, [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9156.96s)]
*  I will discuss the unique historical and operational importance of ANRA. Second, I will demonstrate [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9163.96s)]
*  both why and how Israel has set upon to destroy the agency. And third, I will discuss Israel's [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9171.96s)]
*  legal obligations towards ANRA, which this Court has urgently requested to affirm by [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9179.96s)]
*  the vast majority of states and international organizations in these proceedings. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9185.96s)]
*  First, the context. ANRA's mandate is an essential element of what the Court has twice [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9190.96s)]
*  recognized as the permanent responsibility of the United Nations for the question of [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9197.96s)]
*  Palestine. Its responsibility originates in the unsuccessful attempt by the General Assembly [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9202.96s)]
*  to partition Palestine and without the consent of the Palestinian people in 1947 and the [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9208.96s)]
*  ensuing 1948 Nakba, during which between 750,000 and 900,000 Palestinians were forcibly exiled [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9215.96s)]
*  from that part of Palestine that became Israel. In Resolution 302 of 8 December 1949, the [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9225.96s)]
*  General Assembly recognized that continued assistance for the relief of the Palestine [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9233.96s)]
*  refugees is necessary to prevent conditions of starvation and distress among them and [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9239.96s)]
*  further conditions of peace and stability. ANRA was created to provide direct relief [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9244.96s)]
*  and works programs to the refugees until their plight was resolved in accordance with international [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9250.96s)]
*  law. The Assembly therefore determined that ANRA's mandate was to be discharged without [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9256.96s)]
*  prejudice to the right of the Palestine refugees to return to restitution and to compensation [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9262.96s)]
*  in accordance with Resolution 194 of 11 December 1948. But these rights, Mr. President, have [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9270.96s)]
*  never been allowed to be realized. Indeed, with the Israeli occupation of the rest of [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9278.96s)]
*  Palestine in 1967, another 250,000 to 300,000 Palestinians were forcibly exiled and became [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9283.96s)]
*  dependent on ANRA. And the conditions of starvation and distress have not only continued over [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9293.96s)]
*  the years to varying degrees, but as the Court knows only too well, since October 2023 they [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9299.96s)]
*  have gathered a pace never before seen. In essence, it is because of Israel's prolonged [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9306.96s)]
*  violation of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to return to self-determination, [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9313.96s)]
*  indeed to freedom, that the need for ANRA is as pressing today, if not more so, than [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9320.96s)]
*  it was in 1949. The General Assembly agrees with this assessment. It has continuously [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9328.96s)]
*  renewed ANRA's mandate with overwhelming support, insisting that until the Palestine refugees [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9336.96s)]
*  realize their rights under international law, ANRA must remain in place. Operationally, [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9342.96s)]
*  ANRA provides education, health, relief and social services, and during emergencies, humanitarian [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9349.96s)]
*  aid. And generations of Palestinians have been sustained by these quasi-governmental [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9357.96s)]
*  services in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the occupied Palestinian territory. Uniquely, [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9363.96s)]
*  ANRA's services are directly delivered by thousands of personnel, the vast majority [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9371.96s)]
*  of whom are themselves registered Palestine refugees with the agency. In the occupied [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9376.96s)]
*  Palestinian territory, the number of these staff literally dwarf that of other UN personnel [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9382.96s)]
*  by orders of magnitude, possessing decades of experience, expertise and all-important [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9388.96s)]
*  community trust. And for these reasons, the necessity of ANRA is indisputable. The sheer [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9394.96s)]
*  scope of continued Israeli violations of Israeli rights, or rather of Palestinian rights, [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9402.96s)]
*  including the right to the unhindered provision of urgently needed humanitarian supplies essential [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9408.96s)]
*  for their survival, as well as the right for basic services, humanitarian and developmental [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9415.96s)]
*  assistance in support of their right to self-determination, renders ANRA absolutely vital. As recognized [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9421.96s)]
*  by the General Assembly in the referral resolution, no organization can replace or substitute [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9428.96s)]
*  the agency's capacity or mandate. Mr. President, the Secretary General agrees. He states that [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9435.96s)]
*  ANRA is indispensable in delivering essential services to Palestinians and that ANRA is [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9444.96s)]
*  the backbone of the United Nations humanitarian relief operations in Gaza. This conclusion [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9449.96s)]
*  is shared by other UN and humanitarian agencies operating in Palestine who rely on ANRA's [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9455.96s)]
*  unmatched operational infrastructure, partnership and support. It is also shared by nearly all [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9461.96s)]
*  participants in these proceedings, including China, which has referred to ANRA as indispensable [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9468.96s)]
*  and irreplaceable, both Mexico and Luxembourg, which have each called ANRA unique and irreplaceable, [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9474.96s)]
*  and Algeria, which has labeled ANRA the cornerstone of the humanitarian assistance in occupied [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9481.96s)]
*  Palestinian territory. In his written statement, the Secretary General provided incontrovertible [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9489.96s)]
*  empirical evidence in support of this position. I quote, since October 2023, ANRA has supported [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9495.96s)]
*  nearly 2.3 million affected individuals in Gaza with food, health care and shelter. It [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9504.96s)]
*  has distributed food aid to around 1.9 million people and provided more than 60 percent of [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9512.96s)]
*  primary health care services in Gaza. Furthermore, ANRA has sheltered hundreds of thousands of [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9518.96s)]
*  internally displaced persons in more than 100 schools and continues to deliver psychosocial [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9524.96s)]
*  support and primary health consultations. Between 7 October 2023 and 19 January 2025, [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9529.96s)]
*  ANRA facilitated over 7.3 million medical consultations across Gaza. In the occupied [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9537.96s)]
*  Palestinian territory as a whole, the Secretary General reports further that ANRA operates [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9545.96s)]
*  almost 400 schools, providing education to more than 350,000 students, and over 65 primary [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9550.96s)]
*  health clinics and one hospital, facilitating over 5 million health consultations annually. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9558.96s)]
*  It does all of this with 17,000 personnel. In sum, the evidentiary record shows that [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9566.96s)]
*  ANRA is not just any humanitarian aid organization. It is organically linked to the unique role [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9575.96s)]
*  played by the United Nations in the question of Palestine since 1947, in particular the [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9581.96s)]
*  plight of the Palestine refugees. It is critical to the economic, social and cultural development [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9587.96s)]
*  of the Palestinian people and hence their ability to exercise their right of self-determination. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9594.96s)]
*  And, at least since October 2023, it has been essential to their very survival as a group, [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9599.96s)]
*  especially in Gaza. Mr. President, Members of the Court, I now turn to the question of [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9609.96s)]
*  why Israel wants to prevent ANRA from exercising its mandate. Based on the evidentiary record, [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9616.96s)]
*  Israel's reasons appear to be twofold, one short-term, the other long-term, both indeed [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9623.96s)]
*  inconsistent with its obligations under international law. At the very least, in the short-term, [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9629.96s)]
*  Israel is pursuing the erasure of the Palestinian people in Gaza and ultimately the rest of [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9635.96s)]
*  the occupied Palestinian territory, including through forcible transfer. In Gaza, where [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9640.96s)]
*  almost 80% of the population are already registered refugees connected to the events of 1948, [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9646.96s)]
*  almost the whole of the population, some 1.9 million people, has been forcibly transferred [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9653.96s)]
*  multiple times through Israel's indiscriminate bombardment and starvation campaign. Nor has [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9659.96s)]
*  Israel made a secret of its actions in this regard. Quite the contrary, following multiple [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9665.96s)]
*  calls by government ministers over the course of 2024 to depopulate Gaza and resettle it [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9671.96s)]
*  with Israelis, on 28 January 2025, Israeli military chief of staff, Herzl Halevi, announced [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9677.96s)]
*  a decision to prevent displaced Palestinians from returning. In his words, and I quote, [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9685.96s)]
*  Gazans will be able to exit the Rafah crossing for Egypt, but only in a one-way direction, [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9691.96s)]
*  and they will not be able to return to Gaza. On 5 February 2025, the Israeli Minister of [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9696.96s)]
*  Defense, Israel Katz, ordered the preparation arrangements for what he euphemistically called [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9703.96s)]
*  the voluntary departure of Palestinians. On 19 March 2025, Minister Katz's previously [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9709.96s)]
*  noted final warning to the citizens of Gaza included the following exhortation, and I [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9716.96s)]
*  quote, return the hostages and expel Hamas and other options will be presented to you, [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9722.96s)]
*  including relocation to other places in the world for those who wish. The alternative [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9729.96s)]
*  is utter destruction and devastation. End quote. In the West Bank, in the past four [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9735.96s)]
*  months alone, over 40,000 Palestine refugees have been yet again forcibly transferred through [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9742.96s)]
*  the destruction of four refugee camps by Israel, aided by armed gangs of Israeli settlers who [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9748.96s)]
*  operate alongside Israeli occupation forces. Palestinian West Bankers are literally being [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9755.96s)]
*  forcibly displaced every day. Mr. President, the writing is on the wall. With these brazen [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9761.96s)]
*  suggestions that the departure of Palestinians would be voluntary, Israel is not merely insulting [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9769.96s)]
*  the world's intelligence. It's just simply assuming the world has none. After killing [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9774.96s)]
*  or injuring close to 170,000 Palestinians, after turning Gaza into a moonscape of dust [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9780.96s)]
*  and rubble with over 70,000 tons of bombs, amounting to more than what was dropped on [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9786.96s)]
*  Dresden, Hamburg and London combined during World War II, after destroying or damaging [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9793.96s)]
*  over 92% of civilian housing, 88% of schools, 84% of health facilities, 95% of the [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9800.96s)]
*  water and sanitation systems, and 92% of roads, use of this Orwellian language by [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9810.96s)]
*  Minister Katz must be seen for what it is. An open call to expel as many surviving Palestinians [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9818.96s)]
*  as possible. And as promised by Minister Katz, he's already announced the establishment [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9826.96s)]
*  of an Israeli directorate to oversee the whole thing. Mr. President, my point here is this. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9831.96s)]
*  Elimination of UNRWA is essential to the success of Israel's dreaded plans. Given the scope [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9839.96s)]
*  of UNRWA's capabilities in providing emergency relief, stability and resilience to the Palestinian [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9846.96s)]
*  population in ways that no other organization can operationally do, it is painfully obvious [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9852.96s)]
*  why Israel insists on eliminating the agency. Quite simply, UNRWA is the last hope that [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9859.96s)]
*  the Palestinian people, particularly in the Gaza Strip, have of surviving Israel's genocide [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9867.96s)]
*  against them. More broadly, Israel's long-term purpose behind destroying UNRWA rests in its [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9873.96s)]
*  complete denial of the existence of the Palestinian people, and in particular the status, rights [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9880.96s)]
*  and claims of millions of Palestine refugees to return, to restitution and to compensation. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9886.96s)]
*  But you needn't take my word for it. The Prime Minister of Israel has openly admitted [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9893.96s)]
*  as much on multiple occasions, including it must be stressed, before, years before, 7 [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9898.96s)]
*  October 2023. For instance, on 11 June 2017, Prime Minister Netanyahu proclaimed, and I [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9905.96s)]
*  quote, I regret that UNRWA, to a large degree by its very existence, perpetuates and does [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9914.96s)]
*  not solve the Palestinian refugee problem. Therefore the time has come to disband UNRWA. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9920.96s)]
*  End quote. Similarly, on 7 January 2018, Mr. Netanyahu said, quote, UNRWA is an organization [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9927.96s)]
*  that perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem. It also perpetuates the narrative of the [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9934.96s)]
*  right of return, as it were, in order to eliminate the State of Israel. Therefore UNRWA needs [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9939.96s)]
*  to pass from the world. End quote. Of course, as members of the court will no doubt be aware, [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9947.96s)]
*  Palestine refugee rights are not legally contingent on UNRWA's existence. Nevertheless, according [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9954.96s)]
*  to Israel's strained logic, it is UNRWA, not Israel itself, that is to blame for the continued [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9960.96s)]
*  exile and deprivations of the Palestine refugees. To avoid having to answer for this, therefore, [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9966.96s)]
*  Israel simply wants to do away with the agency. Mr. President, members of the court, I now [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9973.96s)]
*  turn to the issue of how Israel has pursued its objective of destroying UNRWA. In this [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9980.96s)]
*  respect, Israel's approach has been threefold. First, Israel has systematically attacked [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9987.96s)]
*  UNRWA personnel and property. Only since October 2023, almost 300 UNRWA personnel have been [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=9994.96s)]
*  killed by Israel in the Gaza Strip alone, with hundreds more wounded, many for life. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10002.96s)]
*  Numerous others have been abducted from UNRWA premises and tortured, including Tikor's confessions [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10009.96s)]
*  implicating themselves or other agency officials in the events of 7 October. In Gaza, Israel [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10015.96s)]
*  has damaged or destroyed over 310 UNRWA premises since October 2023. These include schools, [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10022.96s)]
*  and health care facilities, many converted into shelters in which thousands of Palestinian [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10031.96s)]
*  civilians have been killed or injured. In the West Bank, Israel has repeatedly violated [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10036.96s)]
*  its obligations to protect UNRWA premises and property, including UNRWA headquarters [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10042.96s)]
*  in East Jerusalem, which has been subjected to arson attacks by Israeli settlers and is [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10047.96s)]
*  now earmarked for Israeli settlement, having been shuttered by Israel in January. Scores [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10052.96s)]
*  of other UNRWA facilities have been attacked, including forcible entry and takeover. For [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10058.96s)]
*  example, on 18 February 2025, Israeli troops forcibly commandeered the UNRWA Kalandia Training [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10063.96s)]
*  Centre, home to 350 students. Likewise, only on April 8, Israel ordered the closure of [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10070.96s)]
*  six UNRWA schools in East Jerusalem, affecting 800 children. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10077.96s)]
*  Mr. President, the second element of Israel's plan to destroy UNRWA is its campaign to undermine [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10082.96s)]
*  the agency's vital sources of funding. On 26 January 2024, the same day this court issued [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10089.96s)]
*  its first Provisional Measures Order on the South Africa matter, after determining that [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10099.96s)]
*  famine was around the corner in Gaza, Israel urged UNRWA's donors to defund the agency, [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10103.96s)]
*  alleging involvement of UNRWA staff in the attack of 7 October. The resulting funding [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10109.96s)]
*  pause by 18 states added massive pressure on agency operations at a time when millions [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10115.96s)]
*  of beleaguered Palestinians needed UNRWA the most. Israel has repeatedly claimed, and without [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10121.96s)]
*  substantiation, including in its written statement in these proceedings, that upwards of approximately [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10128.96s)]
*  12% of UNRWA employees in Gaza are members of what it calls terrorist groups. But as [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10134.96s)]
*  the court is well aware, unsupported allegations do not affect me, no matter how loudly shouted [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10141.96s)]
*  or oft-repeated. The fact is that UNRWA has always responded to Israel's allegations [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10149.96s)]
*  in substance, in good faith, and in a timely manner. As the Secretary General reported [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10155.96s)]
*  on 8 January 2025, UNRWA has responded to every allegation that has been raised by the [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10163.96s)]
*  Government of Israel against personnel of UNRWA regarding possible political activity [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10170.96s)]
*  that may be against the interests of the United Nations or connections to acts of terror based [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10175.96s)]
*  on its policy of zero tolerance for activities of this nature. This is demonstrated by the [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10182.96s)]
*  actions taken by UNRWA following allegations that its personnel may have been involved [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10188.96s)]
*  in the attacks of 7 October 2023. Upon receiving the allegations, immediate administrative [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10192.96s)]
*  steps were taken. I immediately referred the allegations to the Office of Internal Oversight [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10198.96s)]
*  Services for investigation under the organization's regulatory framework. Such actions were consistent [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10203.96s)]
*  with the history of UNRWA engagement with the Government of Israel, whereby it has been [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10210.96s)]
*  responsive to allegations raised by the Government of wrongdoing by UNRWA personnel. This, of [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10215.96s)]
*  course, is in addition to the finding of the Independent Review Group on UNRWA commissioned [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10221.96s)]
*  by the Secretary General in February 2024 that UNRWA possesses a more developed approach [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10226.96s)]
*  to neutrality than other similar UN or NGO entities, following UNRWA's commitment to [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10232.96s)]
*  implement the recommendations of the Review Group nearly all states that paused their [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10238.96s)]
*  funding have since resumed it. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10243.96s)]
*  Mr. President, the third element of Israel's campaign to destroy UNRWA has been the passage [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10248.96s)]
*  of two anti-UNRWA laws in October 2024. They have been discussed earlier, so I will quickly [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10253.96s)]
*  skirt over those. This legislation has had grave implications for UNRWA operations across [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10260.96s)]
*  the occupied Palestinian territory, including in East Jerusalem, over which Israel has unlawfully [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10266.96s)]
*  asserted its sovereignty, as was affirmed just this past summer. Israel's anti-UNRWA [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10271.96s)]
*  legislation, together with its broader attacks against UNRWA, have been roundly rejected [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10277.96s)]
*  by the Security Council, which has spoken with one resolute voice. And I quote, [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10281.96s)]
*  The members of the Security Council strongly warned against any attempts to dismantle or [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10289.96s)]
*  diminish UNRWA, UNRWA's operations and mandate, recognizing that any interruption or suspension [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10294.96s)]
*  of its work would have severe humanitarian consequences for millions of Palestinian refugees [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10301.96s)]
*  who depend on the agency's services and also implications for the region. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10308.96s)]
*  Forgive me, I see the, right there we are. The members of the Security Council expressed [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10313.96s)]
*  their grave concern over legislation adopted by the Israeli Knesset, and in this region [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10318.96s)]
*  and in this regard they urged the Israeli government to abide by its international legal [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10323.96s)]
*  obligations, respect the privileges and immunities of UNRWA, and live up to its responsibility [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10328.96s)]
*  to allow and facilitate full, rapid, and safe and unhindered humanitarian assistance in all of its forms [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10332.96s)]
*  into and throughout the entire Gaza Strip, including the provision of sorely needed basic [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10340.96s)]
*  services to the civilian population. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10346.96s)]
*  I will now turn to my third and final point, namely what are Israel's legal obligations [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10351.96s)]
*  in respect of UNRWA? Now given what you've heard from my colleagues this morning, I can be brief [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10356.96s)]
*  in this respect. First, as part of its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10361.96s)]
*  to self-determination, Israel is required to facilitate and expand, not ban, disrupt, or attack, [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10368.96s)]
*  UNRWA operations in the occupied Palestinian territory. In the referral resolution, the General Assembly [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10375.96s)]
*  specifically called upon Israel to uphold and comply with its obligations, not to impede the Palestinian [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10382.96s)]
*  people from exercising their right to self-determination, including by rescinding any measures [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10389.96s)]
*  that obstruct the provision of basic services and humanitarian and development assistance to the [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10395.96s)]
*  Palestinian people. This plainly includes the services delivered by UNRWA, which is present in the [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10400.96s)]
*  occupied Palestinian territory, it is important to recall, not only at the direction of the General [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10406.96s)]
*  Assembly, but also at the invitation of the State of Palestine and the Palestinian people. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10412.96s)]
*  Second, all of the international humanitarian law obligations of Israel covered by Mr. Reichler [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10418.96s)]
*  apply with equal force in respect of UNRWA operations in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10425.96s)]
*  In particular, Article 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention requires that the occupying power shall agree [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10430.96s)]
*  and facilitate relief schemes if the whole or part of the population of the occupied territory [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10437.96s)]
*  is inadequately supplied. Israel's flagrant breach of this unconditional rule is aggravated by the fact [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10442.96s)]
*  that it is Israel itself who is responsible for the need for relief schemes in the first place. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10450.96s)]
*  This rule must also be read in conjunction with the binding provisional measures order of the court of [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10457.96s)]
*  28 March last year, requiring Israel to, quote, ensure without delay in full cooperation with the United [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10462.96s)]
*  Nations the unhindered provision at scale of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10470.96s)]
*  throughout Gaza. Mr. President, I see we're coming up on the break. All I need is another two minutes, [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10477.96s)]
*  maybe three, and I beg your pardon. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10485.96s)]
*  Yes, you can go ahead. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10490.96s)]
*  Given UNRWA's unmatched ability to provide relief schemes and to do so at scale to the Palestinian [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10492.96s)]
*  population, there can be no doubt that Israel is obligated to facilitate and expand the agency's vital [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10498.96s)]
*  work rather than attack and sabotage it. Third, the obligation of Israel as a member of the United [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10504.96s)]
*  Nations covered by Ms. Nugrali all apply to its relations with UNRWA. Israel's abrogation of its [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10512.96s)]
*  bilateral agreement with UNRWA does not release it from these broader commitments. Israel remains under [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10521.96s)]
*  an obligation to cooperate in good faith with UNRWA, which requires it to give the agency every [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10527.96s)]
*  assistance in any action taken in accordance with the Charter, as has been affirmed by the Secretary-General. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10532.96s)]
*  Israel must also ensure and respect the agency's privileges and immunities, which it enjoys as a subsidiary [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10540.96s)]
*  organ of the United Nations, including in respect of its premises, property, assets, and officials. And, of [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10547.96s)]
*  course, Israel is also required to ensure the safety of UNRWA personnel. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10555.96s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, as I close my presentation, I should like to recall the sobering plea [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10561.96s)]
*  made by the Commissioner-General of UNRWA in a letter to the President of the General Assembly dated 28 October [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10568.96s)]
*  2024. He stated, and I quote, [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10575.96s)]
*  Today I must inform you that the agency is under such physical, political, and operational attack [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10579.96s)]
*  unprecedented in United Nations history that implementation of its mandate may become impossible [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10587.96s)]
*  without the decisive intervention by the General Assembly. The consequences for Palestinians, for Israel, [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10593.96s)]
*  and for the region will be grave. End quote. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10600.96s)]
*  Mr. President, the General Assembly has answered the Commissioner-General's appeal by placing the question [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10604.96s)]
*  of UNRWA's very future and with it the rights, status, and existence of the Palestinian people, [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10610.96s)]
*  including millions of Palestine refugees before you. No less than that is what is at stake in these proceedings. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10617.96s)]
*  Mr. President, Members of the Court, this concludes my presentation, and I should like to thank you [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10626.96s)]
*  for your time and careful attention. This also concludes our presentation for this morning. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10631.96s)]
*  Professor Pele will continue when we reconvene this afternoon. Thank you. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10637.96s)]
*  I thank Mr. M. Sayes. This concludes this morning's sitting. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10641.96s)]
*  The oral proceedings will resume this afternoon at 3 p.m. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10646.96s)]
*  which Palestine will complete its presentation, when the Palestine will complete its presentation, [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10651.96s)]
*  and will be followed by Egypt and Malaysia. The sitting is closed. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=10660.96s)]

*  I shall therefore confine myself to those that breach obligations standing from Gyskogyn's [[05:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18412.96s)]
*  norms, bearing in mind that in accordance with Article 41, paragraph 3 of the IEC draft, [[05:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18420.14s)]
*  the particular consequences of such violations are without prejudice to those resulting from [[05:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18427.78s)]
*  any other breach of international law. [[05:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18433.3s)]
*  Thus, first, the consequences under common law, as set out in the second part of the [[05:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18438.14s)]
*  articles of the IEC. [[05:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18444.36s)]
*  They include cessation of the internationally wrongful Act, assurances and guarantees of [[05:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18446.78s)]
*  non-repetition, and the obligation to repair the harm caused by this Act. [[05:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18453.68s)]
*  In accordance with the principle codified in Article 30, paragraph A of the 2021 draft, [[05:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18462.3s)]
*  Israel must first and foremost put an end to its bombardments, its incursions, the blockade [[05:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18469.46s)]
*  that it has reimposed on Gaza, and the one it continues to impose on the villages and [[05:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18477.519999999997s)]
*  in the refugee camps of the West Bank. [[05:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18485.14s)]
*  This means Israel should put a real end, a real end to the obstacles, to the entry and [[05:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18488.7s)]
*  to the delivery of humanitarian assistance in the occupied Palestinian territory, including [[05:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18499.46s)]
*  East Jerusalem, that it should reopen the entry points through which humanitarian aid [[05:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18505.82s)]
*  transits in Gaza, and of course that Israel should cease the destruction of humanitarian [[05:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18511.98s)]
*  aid distribution centers, and that it should withdraw its occupation forces. [[05:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18518.22s)]
*  Israel must also cease its relentless displacement of Palestinian civilians, particularly in [[05:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18526.300000000003s)]
*  Gaza, where almost 500,000, 500,000 is a quarter of its total population, the enclave's total [[05:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18532.620000000003s)]
*  population. [[05:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18541.66s)]
*  These 500,000 were forced to flee their precarious homes between the end of the ceasefire by [[05:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18543.14s)]
*  Israel and mid-April. [[05:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18548.32s)]
*  Since October 2023, 1,900,000 Palestinians, that is to say around 90% of the Gaza population, [[05:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18552.38s)]
*  have been displaced, often multiple times. [[05:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18563.74s)]
*  The Jewish state must stop dividing up the Palestinian territory of Gaza as well by multiplying [[05:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18567.62s)]
*  the corridors that isolate Palestinians from each other, making it even more difficult [[05:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18574.94s)]
*  for them to access humanitarian assistance when it exists. [[05:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18580.7s)]
*  It also has the obligation not to put the obstacles that it had placed in the way of [[05:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18586.5s)]
*  aid delivery during the truce, including the hundreds of checkpoints and roadblocks that [[05:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18593.22s)]
*  prevent Palestinians from having access to international assistance. [[05:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18599.1s)]
*  The ILC says in its commentary on the 2001 article that, and I quote, [[05:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18603.82s)]
*  Israel cannot therefore invoke any alleged violations committed by the state of Palestine [[05:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18614.38s)]
*  or by other entities to relieve itself from performing its duty to comply immediately [[05:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18628.34s)]
*  with all obligations incumbent on it and that are violated by the ongoing decisions and [[05:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18635.02s)]
*  actions that I have just mentioned. [[05:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18641.9s)]
*  Another important clarification is provided in Article 29 of the ILC's draft, and I quote, [[05:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18650.66s)]
*  The legal consequences of an internationally wrongful act do not affect the continued duty [[05:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18658.300000000003s)]
*  of the responsible state to perform the obligation breached. [[05:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18665.74s)]
*  This duty is clearly linked to the obligation to cease unlawful conduct enshrined in Article [[05:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18671.22s)]
*  30 paragraph A, cessation being, as it were, the negative aspect of future performance. [[05:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18678.420000000002s)]
*  Both are of particular importance in the situation which is the subject of the request for an [[05:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18687.18s)]
*  opinion. [[05:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18693.66s)]
*  Israel must not only revoke all measures prohibiting or restricting delivery of aid [[05:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18696.54s)]
*  to the Palestinian population, whether from international organizations or states, but [[05:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18703.46s)]
*  it must also positively fulfill its humanitarian obligations as an occupying power. [[05:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18710.74s)]
*  These are set out in Articles 56 and 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and include the [[05:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18718.620000000003s)]
*  duty of ensuring and maintaining, with the cooperation of national and local authorities, [[05:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18726.820000000003s)]
*  the medical and hospital establishments and services, public health and hygiene in the [[05:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18733.06s)]
*  occupied territory. [[05:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18739.38s)]
*  End of quote. [[05:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18743.940000000002s)]
*  The General Assembly also has a duty not only to accept relief schemes by other international [[05:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18747.5s)]
*  organizations or states, but also to facilitate them by all the means at its disposal. [[05:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18751.3s)]
*  This is exactly what the General Assembly demands, I repeat demands, in the second paragraph [[05:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18760.34s)]
*  which I quoted a moment ago of Resolution 79-232, which is at the origin of the request [[05:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18767.3s)]
*  for an opinion. [[05:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18776.42s)]
*  It seems particularly important, therefore, that your opinion should specify expressly [[05:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18777.42s)]
*  that Israel must not only rescind all laws impeding the operations of UNRWA and other [[05:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18783.42s)]
*  humanitarian aid workers in the occupied Palestinian territory, but also that it has a duty to [[05:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18788.82s)]
*  facilitate their irreplaceable work and to guarantee the immunities of the personnel, [[05:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18797.94s)]
*  premises and property of the United Nations and international organizations providing [[05:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18804.219999999998s)]
*  such assistance. [[05:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18809.46s)]
*  In the Wall case, you had already noted that its construction, I quote, impeded the freedom [[05:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18811.739999999998s)]
*  of movement of the inhabitants of the occupied Palestinian territory as well as the exercise [[05:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18818.8s)]
*  by these persons of their rights to work, to health, to education and to an adequate [[05:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18825.859999999997s)]
*  standard of living. [[05:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18832.58s)]
*  End of quote. [[05:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18833.58s)]
*  More generally, as you observed in your opinion last year, it is, and I quote, the entire [[05:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18834.58s)]
*  regime of restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians throughout occupied Palestinian [[05:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18841.46s)]
*  territory that has a discriminatory effect on their enjoyment of these rights. [[05:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18848.22s)]
*  End of quote. [[05:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18856.06s)]
*  In this spirit, Israel must also, in application of the Genocide Convention, fulfill its obligation [[05:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18857.780000000002s)]
*  to take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic [[05:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18864.58s)]
*  services and humanitarian assistance to address the difficult living conditions faced by Palestinians [[05:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18872.9s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. [[05:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18880.9s)]
*  End of quote. [[05:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18882.58s)]
*  This is what you decided in your order indicating provisional measures on January 26, 2024. [[05:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18884.54s)]
*  It is perhaps worth recalling that it is legally binding. [[05:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18892.18s)]
*  In addition, under the additional provisional measures that the Court indicated and that [[05:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18898.38s)]
*  justice binding provisional measures indicated on March 20, 2024, Israel says, Israel must, [[05:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18905.940000000002s)]
*  and I would like to quote this long quote, it says, Israel must take all necessary and [[05:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18916.100000000002s)]
*  effective measures to ensure without delay in full cooperation with the United Nations [[05:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18921.74s)]
*  the unhindered provision at scale by all concerned of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian [[05:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18929.3s)]
*  assistance, including food, water, electricity, fuel, shelter, clothing, hygiene and sanitation [[05:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18938.34s)]
*  requirements, as well as medical supplies and medical care to Palestinians throughout [[05:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18949.22s)]
*  Gaza, including by increasing the capacity and number of land crossing points and maintaining [[05:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18958.22s)]
*  them open for as long as necessary. [[05:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18966.18s)]

*  Several resolutions of the Security Council follow the same lines. [[05:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18972.9s)]
*  In the most recent of these resolutions, Resolution 2735 of the 10th of June 2024, the Security [[05:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18977.0s)]
*  Council called for quote, the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the populated areas [[05:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18984.72s)]
*  of Gaza, the return of the Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighborhoods in all of [[05:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18990.52s)]
*  the sectors of Gaza, including in the north and the safe and effective distribution of [[05:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=18997.04s)]
*  humanitarian assistance at scale throughout the Gaza Strip to all Palestinian civilians [[05:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19002.56s)]
*  who need it, including housing units delivered by the international community. [[05:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19010.08s)]
*  End of quote. [[05:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19017.2s)]
*  And before that, in Resolution 2728 of the 25th of March 2024, recalling Resolutions [[05:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19018.2s)]
*  2712 and 2720 of 2023, the Council, I quote, had stressed the urgent need to extend the [[05:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19026.04s)]
*  delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians and to strengthen the protection of civilians [[05:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19037.440000000002s)]
*  throughout the Gaza Strip and once again demanded the lifting of all the impediments to the [[05:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19043.04s)]
*  provision of humanitarian aid at scale pursuant to humanitarian international law. [[05:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19049.82s)]
*  And the General Assembly adopted many resolutions of the same tenor. [[05:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19056.54s)]
*  Just like the decisions and opinions of the court, these resolutions have remained entirely [[05:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19064.14s)]
*  without effect. [[05:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19069.86s)]
*  However, has it been more necessary for the perpetrator of internationally wrongful acts [[05:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19072.02s)]
*  to provide appropriate assurances and guarantees as provided for in subparagraph B of Article [[05:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19079.82s)]
*  3 of the ILC Articles? [[05:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19088.66s)]
*  In the instant case, it is quite certain that mere commitments that Israel might accept, [[05:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19091.72s)]
*  is quite hypothetical. [[05:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19098.6s)]
*  In order to ensure the implementation of the reparation measures incumbent on it, these [[05:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19101.039999999997s)]
*  commitments would in no way suffice to reassure the victims of its actions, be it the Palestinian [[05:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19107.44s)]
*  population or the state of Palestine, nor would it reassure the international community, [[05:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19115.079999999998s)]
*  which also has an interest in their cessation. [[05:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19121.559999999998s)]
*  There being so many reasons to believe that the simple return to the pre-existing situation [[05:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19125.16s)]
*  would not protect the Palestinian population in a satisfactory manner. [[05:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19132.76s)]
*  Indeed, one can only feel grave concern at the consistency with which Israel has ignored [[05:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19138.72s)]
*  the recommendations and decisions of the United Nations bodies, including those of [[05:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19150.28s)]
*  the Security Council, and by the obvious contempt of Israel for the court's decisions, and [[05:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19155.52s)]
*  the casual way in which, in a sheer breach of the principle of good faith, it has betrayed [[05:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19163.199999999997s)]
*  its promises in the past. [[05:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19171.76s)]
*  In particular, by unilaterally breaking on 18 March 2025, the ceasefire agreement concluded [[05:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19173.18s)]
*  on 15 January. [[05:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19180.480000000003s)]
*  We should also bear in mind that it is truly vital for Israel to cease to continually breach [[05:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19182.600000000002s)]
*  its obligations, both as the occupying power and as a member of the United Nations, and [[05:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19192.84s)]
*  also simply as a member of the international community of states as a whole. [[05:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19200.800000000003s)]
*  The State of Palestine has indicated, as an example in paragraph 7.23 of its written [[05:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19207.68s)]
*  submissions, the possible form of the guarantees of non-repetition that Israel should offer [[05:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19214.12s)]
*  to make credible the observance of its obligations pursuant to the request for the opinion. [[05:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19222.88s)]
*  We are convinced that specific guidance in your opinion on this point would be particularly [[05:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19229.68s)]
*  welcome. [[05:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19237.08s)]
*  Because they are forward-looking, the assurances and guarantees aim at preventing other potential [[05:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19241.04s)]
*  violations. [[05:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19246.800000000003s)]
*  They focus on prevention rather than on reparation. [[05:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19247.800000000003s)]
*  The obligation of reparation constitutes, for its part, the most firmly established [[05:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19252.52s)]
*  consequence of any wrongful international act insofar as this act has caused harm. [[05:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19258.88s)]
*  Your Court, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Court, is obviously not called upon [[05:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19274.16s)]
*  to rule on the extent of the damage resulting from the violation by Israel of its international [[05:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19279.52s)]
*  obligations or on the modalities or the precise amount of reparation that is consequently [[05:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19285.72s)]
*  incumbent on it. [[05:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19292.600000000002s)]
*  There is no doubt that the former, the damage, is very considerable, and the second, the [[05:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19294.16s)]
*  reparation must be proportional to it. [[05:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19300.600000000002s)]
*  I don't think it's useful for me to dwell on the rightfully famous Chosov principle, [[05:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19303.800000000003s)]
*  which is unanimously recognised and included in Article 31, paragraph 1 of the ILC Articles, [[05:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19311.600000000002s)]
*  according to which the state liable is under an obligation to make full reparation for [[05:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19317.84s)]
*  the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act. [[05:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19323.32s)]
*  It stems from this that the reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences [[05:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19329.28s)]
*  of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would in all probability have existed [[05:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19334.08s)]
*  if the act had not been committed. [[05:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19341.16s)]
*  These obligations are incumbent on Israel in the form of restitution or compensation [[05:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19342.92s)]
*  and satisfaction insofar as the injury cannot be repaired by restitution. [[05:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19350.32s)]
*  Neither is it necessary, Mr President, to enter into the detail of the applicable law. [[05:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19356.36s)]
*  You have sufficiently been reminded of it. [[05:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19360.86s)]
*  However, I do think it worth dealing briefly with the particular reparation modalities [[05:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19363.76s)]
*  called for in the circumstances of this case. [[05:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19372.719999999998s)]
*  Although there is no question of fully repairing all of the consequences resulting from the [[05:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19377.199999999997s)]
*  occupation and the unlawful presence of Israel in the Palestinian territories, the findings [[05:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19383.12s)]
*  you made last year in your opinion on the legal consequences of the policies and practices [[05:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19390.160000000003s)]
*  of Israel are to a large extent transposable to the present case. [[05:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19395.52s)]
*  Thus, there is no doubt that Israel has the obligation to fully repair the damage caused [[05:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19400.88s)]
*  by its internationally unlawful acts to all the natural and legal persons concerned through [[05:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19408.160000000003s)]
*  the impediments that it has imposed to the supplying of basic supplies essential for [[05:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19418.16s)]
*  the survival of the Palestinian civil population and of basic services as well as humanitarian [[05:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19424.56s)]
*  aid and aid to development. [[05:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19432.079999999998s)]
*  This is in conformity with the rule codified in Article 33 of the ILC project according [[05:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19435.68s)]
*  to which the obligations of the state responsible, of the state liable, can be owed to another [[05:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19441.86s)]
*  state, to several states or to the international community as a whole, in particular according [[05:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19449.06s)]
*  to the nature and the content of the international obligation which has been breached and the [[05:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19454.82s)]
*  circumstances of this breach. [[05:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19460.420000000002s)]
*  In the instant case, the breaches of Israel to its humanitarian obligations have created [[05:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19462.5s)]
*  terrible human suffering, mostly irreparable through restitution, including the death of [[05:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19469.06s)]
*  many Palestinian civilians, thousands of them, including thousands of children. [[05:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19478.420000000002s)]
*  Restitution, which is the rule insofar as it is not materially impossible, is not nevertheless [[05:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19485.620000000003s)]
*  to be ruled out when it comes to other damages, including, for example, repairing public [[05:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19493.140000000003s)]
*  infrastructure or reconstructing utilities, rebuilding houses, hospitals and schools, and [[05:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19499.780000000002s)]
*  the restitution of healthcare or teaching materials equivalent to those which were destroyed [[05:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19513.22s)]
*  by Israeli military operations. [[05:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19521.38s)]
*  As to the suffering itself, only appropriate compensation, combined with the excuses and [[05:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19525.620000000003s)]
*  apologies of the Israeli authorities, is of a nature to ensure reparation. [[05:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19533.54s)]
*  The state of Palestine is also entitled to reparation for the many damages that the policies [[05:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19539.3s)]
*  and actions of Israel in gross violation of international law have caused and that my [[05:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19545.7s)]
*  colleagues have described in detail in their interventions this morning. [[05:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19551.46s)]
*  This is true in particular of the collective harm suffered by the Palestinian population, [[05:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19556.58s)]
*  in particular because of the constant displacement imposed by Israel to the population of Gaza [[05:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19562.74s)]
*  and the expulsions carried out in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. [[05:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19569.22s)]
*  The same applies to the isolation of Palestinian villages inaccessible to humanitarian aid from [[05:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19577.46s)]
*  third states or international organizations. [[05:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19585.62s)]
*  This is true also of the consequent infringement of the right of the Palestinian people to [[05:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19588.66s)]
*  self-determination. [[05:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19595.86s)]
*  This damage is difficult to repair in full through restitution or through compensation. [[05:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19597.78s)]
*  Here, appropriate satisfaction is due and we believe it would be very useful for the [[05:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19606.9s)]
*  Court to provide examples of it. [[05:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19612.260000000002s)]
*  It also falls to you, Members of the Court, to make clear that Israel owes reparation [[05:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19615.38s)]
*  to the United Nations, including to UNRWA and to the very many other international organizations [[05:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19621.94s)]
*  and states involved in the humanitarian aid to Gaza and in the rest of the occupied Palestinian [[05:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19628.98s)]
*  territory for the destruction caused to their property. [[05:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19635.94s)]
*  It is also incumbent on Israel to compensate their staff or their beneficiaries, [[05:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19640.26s)]
*  and to make clear that the breaches by Israel of its obligations covered by the question put to you [[05:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19647.780000000002s)]
*  correspond to what articles 40 and 41 of the ILC project describe as serious violations by the state [[05:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19654.02s)]
*  of obligations stemming from peremptory norms of general international law that are not [[05:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19662.5s)]
*  considered as international crimes of the state. [[05:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19668.899999999998s)]
*  I do not wish to revive this quarrel over terminology, but it must be said that that [[05:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19687.059999999998s)]
*  expression had the merit of stressing the seriousness of the violations at issue. [[05:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19691.94s)]
*  In its current wording, which is hardly any different from that adopted in the first version [[05:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19697.699999999997s)]
*  of the draft article, article 41 draws from these violations consequences which deal largely with [[05:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19705.14s)]
*  the consequential obligations of all of the states of the international community, including [[05:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19713.78s)]
*  in particular that of cooperating to put an end through lawful means to all serious violations of [[05:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19719.3s)]
*  obligations stemming from peremptory norms and that of not recognizing as lawful a situation [[05:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19726.5s)]
*  created by such a violation, nor to render aid or assistance to the maintaining of the situation. [[05:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19733.86s)]
*  In its written observations, the state of Palestine has analyzed in some detail these [[05:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19741.3s)]
*  obligations incumbent upon third parties, be they states or international organizations. [[05:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19746.98s)]
*  Let me ask you to refer back to them. It follows that Israel must answer for its [[05:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19753.54s)]
*  breaches towards the international community as a whole and more particularly towards the states [[05:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19760.34s)]
*  and international organizations whose human action it has prevented or hindered and continues [[05:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19768.26s)]
*  to hinder throughout the occupied Palestinian territory and in particular in Gaza, thus [[05:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19776.42s)]
*  contributing to worsening the suffering of the Palestinian people deprived of its fundamental [[05:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19783.379999999997s)]
*  right to self-determination. Furthermore, paragraph three of article 41 specifies [[05:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19790.019999999997s)]
*  that this paragraph is without prejudice to the other consequences provided for [[05:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19796.420000000002s)]
*  in the present part, part two, of the draft article devoted to the content of the international [[05:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19801.46s)]
*  liability of the state and any additional consequence under international law of a violation [[05:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19807.86s)]
*  covered by this chapter that devoted to serious breaches. In the circumstances which gave rise [[05:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19817.86s)]
*  to the present request for an opinion, one of these particular consequences stems from [[05:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19824.42s)]
*  the obligation upon Israel and upon any other member states and states parties to seek pursuant [[05:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19829.539999999997s)]
*  to article 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, I quote, the persons alleged to have committed [[05:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19836.82s)]
*  or to have ordered to commit such grave breaches as defined in the following article and to [[05:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19845.059999999998s)]
*  bring them for trial before its own courts regardless of their nationality, including [[05:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19853.46s)]
*  therefore where if they have Israeli nationality or to hand such persons over for trial to another [[05:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19858.9s)]
*  contracting party. Among the serious breaches covered by article 147, one can quote, in human [[05:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19866.74s)]
*  treatment, the fact of intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, [[05:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19875.54s)]
*  unlawful deportation or transfer, all these acts which have undeniably been committed through [[05:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19883.38s)]
*  Israeli decisions aiming to quote the terms of resolution 79 slash 232 to impede the supplying [[05:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19892.74s)]
*  of basic items essential for the survival of the Palestinian civil population [[05:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19903.14s)]
*  and also the provision of basic services as well as human and development assistance for the benefit [[05:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19910.66s)]
*  of the Palestinian civilian population in support of the right for the Palestinian population to [[05:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19917.22s)]
*  self-determination. Furthermore, pursuant to article 148, Israel may not exonerate itself [[05:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19925.62s)]
*  or any other high contracting party of any liability incurred by itself or another [[05:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19932.579999999998s)]
*  contracting party in respect of these breaches. States must investigate war crimes committed by [[05:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19939.94s)]
*  their nationals or by their armed forces or on their territory and if applicable, [[05:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19948.82s)]
*  prosecute the suspects. They must also investigate other war crimes falling within their jurisdiction [[05:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19954.739999999998s)]
*  and this obligation is also enshrined in many instruments, in particular in article 6 of the [[05:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19962.42s)]
*  Convention on Genocide of 1948, article 7 of the 1973 Convention on the Protection of Persons [[05:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19969.94s)]
*  Enjoying International Protection or in article 7 of the Convention Against Torture [[05:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19979.379999999997s)]
*  and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Penalties or Treatments of 1984. As specified by the ICRC, [[05:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=19988.42s)]
*  all these obligations breached by Israel also have a customary character. In its judgment of [[05:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20001.3s)]
*  the 9th of February 2022, the Court observes that pursuant to article 146 of the Fourth Geneva [[05:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20009.3s)]
*  Convention on the Protection of Civilian Populations in Times of War, the state concerned [[05:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20015.7s)]
*  had the obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible for the commission of such [[05:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20025.06s)]
*  violations. The same obligation is incumbent upon Israel when it comes to prosecuting, [[05:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20031.54s)]
*  judging and punishing those responsible for these breaches pursuant to the same provisions. [[05:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20041.06s)]
*  Mr President, I know how full the general list of cases of the Court is, but the swiftness [[05:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20047.86s)]
*  with which yourselves and your colleagues replied to the call from the General Assembly asking you [[05:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20055.78s)]
*  to rule on a priority basis and with the utmost urgency shows that you are aware of what is at [[05:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20064.98s)]
*  stake. You must alert the world with the legal authority you carry and your legitimacy as the [[05:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20071.94s)]
*  main legal organ of the United Nations on this absolute emergency to bring an end to the horror [[05:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20081.14s)]
*  created by the actions of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory and in particular, but not [[05:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20088.74s)]
*  only in Gaza. Your opinion will serve as an alert which will be all the more irreplaceable that you [[05:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20094.66s)]
*  will rule according to the law in a precise and detailed manner not only on the consequences of [[05:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20104.34s)]
*  the grave breaches committed by Israel but also on those which fall to the international community [[05:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20110.9s)]
*  as a whole. The breaches committed by Israel have directly infringed the rights of many of them [[05:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20117.94s)]
*  have infringed the rights of many of these states and obligate international organizations and [[05:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20133.379999999997s)]
*  prevented them from supplying to the Palestinian population the essential humanitarian need [[05:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20140.26s)]
*  they need and you will not fail to recall that the peremptory character of the obligations breached [[05:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20147.140000000003s)]
*  also imposes duties on them. Members of the court, all professors of international law have come [[05:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20154.18s)]
*  under the fire of questions from their students doubting the truly legal nature of international [[05:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20162.82s)]
*  law and the in the current geopolitical context this question is of interest to public opinion as [[05:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20172.02s)]
*  a whole. One cannot expect from the law more that it can provide. It is by essence normative and [[05:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20178.100000000002s)]
*  prescriptive but it would be a mistaken view of things to claim that it is pointless. [[05:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20185.14s)]
*  It serves and this is far from negligible to show the way to say over and beyond alternative truths [[05:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20192.58s)]
*  which principles and rules should guide the action of states and other subjects of law [[05:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20200.5s)]
*  in order to ensure the promotion of peace and justice in the world where today they are so [[05:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20207.46s)]
*  tragically threatened. For this you have a very prominent role to play. I was recently [[05:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20213.54s)]
*  interviewed by a leading French newspaper and I said that your opinion of July of last year [[05:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20222.02s)]
*  had saved the honor of international law. We are convinced that this new opinion you will be [[05:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20228.66s)]
*  handing down on the basis of the request from the General Assembly will warrant the same appreciation. [[05:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20236.02s)]
*  Thank you for your attention and I would ask you Mr President to give the floor to His Excellency [[05:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20242.5s)]
*  Mr Riyad Mansour for some concluding remarks. I now give the floor to His Excellency Dr Riyad Mansour [[05:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20247.54s)]
*  you have the floor sir. [[05:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20258.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20272.66s)]
*  Mr President, honorable judges, it is an honor to address you and a heavy burden to speak on behalf [[05:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20281.14s)]
*  of a people as it is being decimated. We are proud of being Palestinians but being Palestinian comes [[05:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20294.98s)]
*  with its share of pain and it has never been more painful to be Palestinian than today. [[05:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20308.02s)]
*  Why does Israel destroy homes and hospitals? Why does it destroy vital infrastructure and [[05:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20320.02s)]
*  humanitarian projects? Why does Israel hinder or block assistance to the Palestinian people including [[05:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20328.1s)]
*  and indispensable to the survival of the population or to meet their most basic needs? [[05:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20337.62s)]
*  Why does it attack humanitarians, killing those trying to save lives? [[05:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20350.1s)]
*  The answer is deeply linked to this Court's 2024 opinion. [[05:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20356.899999999998s)]
*  To entrench its unlawful presence, to deny us our right to self-determination, [[05:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20365.539999999997s)]
*  to dispossess, displace and destroy our people, to colonize and annex our land. Israel is openly [[05:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20372.82s)]
*  confessing to these goals. The Israeli Prime Minister has openly instructed his occupation army [[05:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20382.980000000003s)]
*  to seize Palestinian land in Gaza. His government considers that all of the West Bank is theirs to [[05:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20392.100000000002s)]
*  claim. Israel has admitted to voluntarily blocking aid and to the use of aid as a weapon. [[05:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20400.66s)]
*  Israeli officials have been clear that they consider nobody in Gaza to be innocent. [[05:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20410.74s)]
*  They are seeking to end our presence in the land as a nation. [[05:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20419.22s)]
*  Netanyahu has said unambiguously that he will not allow the exercise by the Palestinian people [[05:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20425.94s)]
*  of their right to self-determination, including their right to their independent state. [[05:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20435.3s)]
*  The Israeli Knesset adopted laws to entrench this denial of our rights and of our existence [[05:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20444.1s)]
*  as a nation. The Israeli courts shielded those committing all these crimes. [[05:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20451.78s)]
*  It is thus no coincidence that most of the humanitarian and development projects destroyed [[05:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20458.34s)]
*  by Israel in the West Bank over decades were the ones intended for communities in East Jerusalem [[05:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20466.420000000002s)]
*  and in the so-called Area C, the areas that constitute priority targets of Israeli's annexation [[05:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20473.94s)]
*  efforts. By denying these communities a place to live, to study, to heal, by denying these [[05:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20483.38s)]
*  their access to electricity and water, as many of my colleagues have stated in their statements, [[05:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20493.38s)]
*  by denying them international protection from violence, Israel pursues their [[05:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20502.74s)]
*  erosions. It is no coincidence that Israel destroyed in Gaza all the requirements for our [[05:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20509.46s)]
*  people's lives and for their very survival, including hospitals and schools, shelters and [[05:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20516.98s)]
*  bakeries, farmlands and water and sanitation facilities. It is no coincidence that Israel [[05:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20525.3s)]
*  bombs and kills the humanitarians who are trying to assist an entire civilian population to survive, [[05:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20533.7s)]
*  killing, maiming, detaining and torturing UN personnel, humanitarian and doctors attacking [[05:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20542.74s)]
*  the convoys of international volunteers and killing Palestine Red Crescent, and the [[05:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20551.62s)]
*  civil defence and rescue teams. It is to deprive the population of any assistance so it had [[05:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20560.02s)]
*  no means to survive the devastation, death and destruction imposed on it by Israeli's relentless [[05:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20567.46s)]
*  bombardments, its levelling of homes and roads and infrastructure and its inherent threat to the [[05:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20576.66s)]
*  world. Now, after having killed and maimed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, Netanyahu calls for [[05:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20584.5s)]
*  the voluntary migration of the survivors. Is it voluntary migration when to destroy [[05:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20592.82s)]
*  a people you leave them trapped between death and displacement? [[05:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20601.14s)]
*  Is it? We want life and liberty and dignity in our land and in our children's lifetime. [[05:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20607.46s)]
*  Instead, our children are being killed, orphaned, amputated, traumatized, displaced, humiliated, [[05:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20615.3s)]
*  witnessing and enduring what no child should witness. [[05:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20624.02s)]
*  Those who survive will never fully recover from this nightmare. [[05:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20629.38s)]
*  At the heart of the UN Charter, there is a pledge, the ultimate goal behind the creation of this [[05:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20635.62s)]
*  organization, to save successive generations from the school of war. [[05:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20642.42s)]
*  Well, successive Palestinian generations were left to endure wars and occupation. [[05:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20648.66s)]
*  And this Palestinian generation is being killed and its genocide is live streamed for all to see. [[05:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20655.22s)]
*  And it continues to be the same. [[05:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20664.98s)]
*  And this Palestinian generation is being killed and its genocide is live streamed for all to see. [[05:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20667.38s)]
*  And it continues with no end in sight. [[05:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20677.62s)]
*  Pope Francis may rest in peace, rightfully said, I quote, [[05:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20683.059999999998s)]
*  This is not war. This is cruelty. End of quotation. [[05:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20689.86s)]
*  What makes this even more outrageous is the fact people fleeing bombardments and displaced [[05:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20696.18s)]
*  time and time again, coping with terrible loss, are denied aid that is almost within grasp. [[05:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20705.06s)]
*  They are starving while food rots at the border. [[05:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20714.18s)]
*  They are dying of wounds that could be healed. [[05:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20719.3s)]
*  They are scumming to disease that could be prevented. [[05:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20724.1s)]
*  The UN Office of High Commission for Human Rights stated a few days ago, and I quote, [[05:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20729.46s)]
*  Extremely high civilian casualties over 18 months do not appear to have prompted any changes in [[05:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20744.1s)]
*  Israeli targeting practices and policies. A pattern indicating, at the very least, [[05:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20752.739999999998s)]
*  a complete disregard for the lives of civilians in Gaza. [[05:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20761.059999999998s)]
*  Match with Israelis' policy of deliberately blocking life-saving assistance from entering [[05:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20766.02s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, these policies appear to be aimed at punishing the civilian population of Gaza [[05:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20772.9s)]
*  and inflicting on them conditions of life increasingly impossible with their continued [[05:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20780.18s)]
*  existence as a group in Gaza. End of quotation. [[05:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20786.82s)]
*  Why did humanity enact rules if those who are entitled to their protection [[05:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20792.100000000002s)]
*  are left in harm's way and those who should be held responsible for their breach are shielded? [[05:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20799.62s)]
*  Among the rules considered the most sacred in the international order are [[05:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20809.86s)]
*  the prohibition of aggression and its corollary is the inadmissibility of the acquisition of [[05:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20816.82s)]
*  territory by force, the prohibition of genocide, the prohibition of crimes against humanity, [[05:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20824.58s)]

*  denying humanitarian and development assistance to the Palestinian people [[05:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCYZCwkDPiA&t=20875.7s)]
