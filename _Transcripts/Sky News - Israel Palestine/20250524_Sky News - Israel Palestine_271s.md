Video Description: The head of the UN has said Israel has only authorised aid to Gaza that "amounts to a teaspoon" after at least 60 people died in overnight airstrikes.

UN secretary general Antonio Guterres warned on Friday that more people will die unless there is "rapid, reliable, safe and sustained aid access".

Sky News' Alex Rossi reports from Jerusalem as an Israeli strike has reportedly killed nine children.

# Nine children reportedly killed in Israeli strikes | Israel-Hamas War
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI)
*  Tell us more about the bombing here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, the Israeli military offensive is continuing. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  It is intensifying in Gaza. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=9.84s)]
*  And it is civilians that are continuing really to pay the price. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=12.76s)]
*  Now, we have had these pictures emerging from the southern area [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=17.92s)]
*  around the city of Khan Yunis. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=22.2s)]
*  And they are some of the most distressing images [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  that we have seen yet in this war. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=28.48s)]
*  Most of these pictures, of course, of this feed of images, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=30.68s)]
*  we can't show you because they are simply too graphic. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  But what we can show you are emergency workers arriving [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=38.24s)]
*  at this house, the site of a missile strike. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  And then they take out body after body. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  You can see that they are clearly, you can identify the human form [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  of what they are. They are children. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=54.64s)]
*  The charred remains of children. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=57.28s)]
*  And you watch the video feed and it is child after child [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=59.76s)]
*  pulled out of the rubble of this house. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  Now, nearby on the ground is the father of these children. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=67.32s)]
*  He is a doctor from the nearby Nasser Medical Complex. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=72.56s)]
*  His wife, the mother of the nine children who have been killed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=76.84s)]
*  She is also a doctor, a paediatrician at the same complex. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  He is stretched away, taken away by the emergency workers. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=84.6s)]
*  And it is touch and go whether or not he will survive. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=88.84s)]
*  Now, there are two British doctors, Graham Groom and Victoria Rose, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=92.08s)]
*  who are working at the Nasser Medical Complex. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=97.0s)]
*  And they had these details. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=99.88s)]
*  They gave us this update about what had happened. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=102.28s)]
*  This is what they had to say. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=105.2s)]
*  The last patient on my list today was an 11-year-old boy [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=108.12s)]
*  who seemed much younger. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=111.72s)]
*  He lifted him onto the operating table. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  His injuries were bad enough, but the background, I think, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=117.72s)]
*  was worse in an attack that may or may not have been aimed at his father. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  His father was very badly injured, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=127.72s)]
*  but nine of his brothers and sisters were killed. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=130.08s)]
*  And his mum is a paediatrician at the hospital. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=134.32s)]
*  I mean, I was sent a video of them going to the house. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  They lived on the site of Petro Station, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  so I don't know whether the bomb set off some massive fire, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=145.8s)]
*  but the video shows all of the children being pulled out of the fire, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=150.96s)]
*  and they're absolutely chocked and crispy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=155.8s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=158.36s)]
*  I think it is unimaginable that, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  for that poor woman, both of them are doctors here. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=166.12s)]
*  The father was a physician here at the Nasa Hospital. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  We've asked about him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  He had no political and no military connections. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=176.72000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't seem to be prominent on social media, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  and yet his poor wife is the only uninjured one [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=183.8s)]
*  who has the prospect of losing her husband, has already lost... [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=187.36s)]
*  I'm so very sorry. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=191.68s)]
*  No, yes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=194.08s)]
*  I think a particularly sad day, but that is the... [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  That is like in Gaza. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  That's the way it goes in Gaza. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=203.56s)]
*  Well, there, outlining really the very human cost of this war. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=208.68s)]
*  We have asked the Israeli Defence Force for comments, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=212.0s)]
*  but no comment yet has been forthcoming on that strike. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  Right, but of course, as this war intensifies by Israel, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=220.08s)]
*  as it tries to achieve what it says its aims are, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=223.44000000000003s)]
*  the elimination of Hamas, the bringing back of hostages, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=226.56s)]
*  the humanitarian situation is worsening by the hour and by the minute. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=229.8s)]
*  The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  has said that the levels of death and destruction now [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  are just absolutely horrendous. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  We are hearing that some aid has got in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  after huge amounts of international pressure for Israel [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=245.44s)]
*  to lift its blockade of the enclave, but not nearly enough. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=249.44s)]
*  And according to aid agencies, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=254.08s)]
*  much of the population now is on the brink of famine. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnE4ko8jrqI&t=256.68s)]
