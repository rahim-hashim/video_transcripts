# Israeli government spokesman holds briefing
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc)
*  Most of the projectiles were successfully intercepted by our Air Force. Israel will not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=0.0s)]
*  tolerate the launch of rockets at our population centers. They are designed to kill. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=5.48s)]
*  We will remove any threats to our citizens. The IDF destroyed the launcher from where the rocket was fired. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=11.46s)]
*  From where the rockets were fired, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=18.96s)]
*  Israel is operating against the Hamas terror organization and other terror organizations throughout [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=21.32s)]
*  Gaza with increasing intensity, increasing intensity. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=27.88s)]
*  Israel is destroying terror infrastructure. We're eliminating terrorists, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=33.12s)]
*  including over the weekend the military commander in the Palestinian Mujahideen terrorist organization [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=38.0s)]
*  who infiltrated Kibbutz near Oz, and it was him. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=44.28s)]
*  It was him that oversaw the abductions of Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel Bivas, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=49.0s)]
*  and was most likely involved with their murder. His name was Muhammad Awad. Awad was also [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=55.64s)]
*  responsible for the abductions and the burial of Gad and Judy Lynn [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=62.68s)]
*  Weinstein and of the other Thai citizens who were taken hostage. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=67.44s)]
*  And also in Gaza, Israel is reorganizing the area. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=72.08s)]
*  Already we've eliminated senior terrorists, operatives, commanders, as well as [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=78.4s)]
*  munitions and infrastructure to restate Israel's war goals. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=83.7s)]
*  They are of course firstly to return all of the hostages, both the living and the deceased. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=87.78s)]
*  59 in total remain in captivity, the live and those who have already been murdered by Hamas. The elimination of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=93.3s)]
*  the military and governmental capabilities of the Hamas terrorist organization and the removal of the terrorist threat from the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=101.9s)]
*  18 months to the day into this war. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=110.94000000000001s)]
*  It could have ended a long time ago if Hamas would release all the hostages and surrender, but Hamas and the other terrorist organizations refuse, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=115.9s)]
*  meaning that every casualty on both sides of the border should be laid firmly and squarely at the feet of the terrorists. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=125.7s)]
*  Next to the latest psychological terror videos released by Hamas of our beloved hostages, Bar Kuprsteen and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=135.3s)]
*  Maxime Hurkin. This is the first sign of life from both of them for 18 months. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=144.3s)]
*  That is unimaginable cruelty for these men and their families and their friends and for our entire nation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=151.62s)]
*  Holding these hostages captive in horrific conditions under constant danger to their lives and in violation of international law, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=158.82000000000002s)]
*  Israel is committed to bringing them all home. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=167.18s)]
*  Next to Lebanon, Israel will not allow terrorist organizations to operate against this country from Lebanese territory. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=172.9s)]
*  I can confirm over the weekend the commander of Hamas' western sector in Lebanon, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=179.86s)]
*  was eliminated. He promoted terrorist activity against IDF soldiers and Israeli citizens. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=185.94s)]
*  He was responsible for launching rockets at Sfat, the same rockets that killed an IDF officer, a soldier and injured other soldiers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=193.14s)]
*  And finally, as you know, the Prime Minister has arrived in Washington, D.C. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=203.22s)]
*  The strong alliance between Israel and the U.S. is stronger now than it has ever been. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=208.82s)]
*  And it's of course based on shared worldviews and values. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=214.82s)]
*  Israel thanks President Trump and his administration for their unyielding support for Israel, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=219.85999999999999s)]
*  as well as their steadfast commitment to the issue of the hostages and the fortification of Israel's security, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=225.38s)]
*  all the while striving for peace and stability in the Middle East. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=232.1s)]
*  The Prime Minister will meet this evening, Israel time, this afternoon, U.S. time, in Washington with U.S. President Trump. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=236.66000000000003s)]
*  The two will discuss a number of important security issues and policy issues, among them, of course, the effort to get our hostages home. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=246.02s)]
*  First and foremost amongst them, the war in Gaza, the Iranian threat, Israel-Turkey relations, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=253.78000000000003s)]
*  as well as the issue of tariffs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=260.90000000000003s)]
*  On the issue of tariffs last night, the Prime Minister met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Luetnick, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=263.70000000000005s)]
*  together with U.S. Trade Representative Jameson Greer. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=270.90000000000003s)]
*  The meeting was described as warm and friendly and productive. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=274.02000000000004s)]
*  There is indeed a long line of world leaders seeking President Trump's ear. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=277.94000000000005s)]
*  And Israel is proud to be the first. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  Okay, that's the end of our briefing here today. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=287.14s)]
*  I will now take your questions. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=290.34s)]
*  Please put your questions in the chat together with your news outlet and we will take them. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=292.73999999999995s)]
*  First question is from Alistair Bunkle from Sky News. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  Let me read your question here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=305.85999999999996s)]
*  The IDF initially claimed that eight of the 15 medics were killed were Hamas. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=309.86s)]
*  This is now being revised down to six. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=314.26s)]
*  Given that the initial reports about the ambulances not using their emergency lights have now been exposed as false [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=316.26s)]
*  and the lack of any evidence provided so far to prove some of the medics were Hamas, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=323.06s)]
*  why should we conclude that they're anything but innocent medical and aid workers? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=328.66s)]
*  And you've also asked what state of the country is the most vulnerable. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=333.06s)]
*  And you've also asked what steps have been taken by the IDF whilst the international investigation proceeds. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=337.3s)]
*  Have soldiers been involved, involved in withdrawn from duties in Gaza? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=342.26s)]
*  Thank you for that question, Alistair. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=347.86s)]
*  Alistair, there's an issue which I almost never see reported in international media. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=352.41999999999996s)]
*  And that is the fact that it is a matter of public record that Hamas have on many occasions, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=357.86s)]
*  many documented occasions, used ambulances as a cover. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=365.62s)]
*  What sort of cover? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=371.94s)]
*  To transport terrorists, to escape from Israel's forces, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=373.54s)]
*  abusing the very notion of emergency services. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=379.06s)]
*  Just like the boy that cried wolf in Aesop's Fables, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=383.86s)]
*  Hamas have been abusing emergency services. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=389.78s)]
*  And that is the real essence of this issue. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=393.3s)]
*  But on the reports about the attack on aid workers in Ruffa, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=397.7s)]
*  whilst on a stakeout against terrorist activity, against terrorist activity, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=402.5s)]
*  IDF soldiers opened fire from a distance at vehicles that were moving suspiciously [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=407.06s)]
*  in their direction. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=412.58000000000004s)]
*  Among the dead were six Hamas terrorists. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=413.7s)]
*  What were Hamas terrorists doing in ambulances? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=417.46000000000004s)]
*  The incident was reported in real time to UN officials. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=420.5s)]
*  The IDF is conducting an investigation, as you know, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=424.02s)]
*  into the circumstances of the incident that took place two weeks ago. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=427.38s)]
*  The Hamas terror organisation systematically violates international law [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=431.53999999999996s)]
*  by taking over civilian facilities and infrastructure, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=438.41999999999996s)]
*  including hospitals, schools and mosques, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=441.7s)]
*  while cruelly exploiting and placing the civilian population in Gaza at risk [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=445.46s)]
*  by using it as a human shield for its actions. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=452.58s)]
*  So with this ongoing investigation, I'll leave that answer at that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=457.78s)]
*  The results of the investigation should be released shortly. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=461.78s)]
*  Next question is from Joel Pollock at Breitbart News. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=466.82s)]
*  What is Israel's response to Iran's implication that it will not negotiate with US President [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=470.82s)]
*  Donald Trump? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=478.5s)]
*  Your second question is, is it Israel's impression that Iran is retreating from Yemen [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=483.7s)]
*  and the Houthis, as media have reported? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=490.98s)]
*  Thank you very much for that question, Joel. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  When it comes to Iran, we have often stated our position on Iran. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=498.18s)]
*  We've said that Iran is, as our prime minister has made clear, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=504.97999999999996s)]
*  over the many, many years, Iran cannot be allowed to achieve a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=513.6999999999999s)]
*  Israel is focused on that issue, and I know that the US is as well. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=519.78s)]
*  President Trump agrees with this. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=523.38s)]
*  Israel supports President Trump's maximum pressure campaign. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=526.1800000000001s)]
*  It was working before it was interrupted. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=529.94s)]
*  That means crippling sanctions and also a credible military threat to counter Iran's [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=532.58s)]
*  nuclear ambitions. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=537.3000000000001s)]
*  The strategy deterred Iran until the pressure was removed, so Israel welcomes the restoration [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=538.58s)]
*  of the maximum pressure campaign. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=544.5s)]
*  President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu see eye to eye on the Iranian nuclear threat. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=546.4200000000001s)]
*  These maximum pressure policies should be restored. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=551.3000000000001s)]
*  As they have been, and it's Israel's long-standing position that Iran must never be allowed to [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=555.0600000000001s)]
*  develop a nuclear weapon, and Israel will do whatever it takes to prevent that from [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=561.22s)]
*  happening. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=567.62s)]
*  When it comes to the Houthis, we have talked at length about the issues of the Houthis. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=568.74s)]
*  We've mentioned them many, many times before. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=576.1800000000001s)]
*  The prime minister has spoken about the three H's of Iran. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=579.5400000000001s)]
*  That is Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=582.82s)]
*  They are, in essence, Iran is the head of the snake, but those three are the fangs, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=585.38s)]
*  as it were, of that snake, and all of them are associated with Iran. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=594.02s)]
*  Now, the terrorist regime in Yemen, the Houthis, which are funded and guided by Iran, they've [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=601.38s)]
*  resumed firing at Israel. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=607.22s)]
*  Well, over the past few weeks, the Houthis have fired several times at Israel's population. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=608.66s)]
*  Let's be clear, these firings of ballistic missiles are intended for mass murder of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=617.4599999999999s)]
*  Israelis. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=623.3s)]
*  That is their intention, but thankfully, they've all been intercepted before crossing into [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=623.78s)]
*  our territory. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=628.74s)]
*  The Houthi intention is clear. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=629.62s)]
*  To destroy Israel, we will not accept repeated threats to our existence. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=631.54s)]
*  We will continue to operate with force against all terrorist threats to our citizens, and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=637.14s)]
*  the terrorist threats from Yemen, which we receive, will get a strong and decisive response, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=642.5s)]
*  as we have done in partnership with the United States. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=651.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=656.26s)]
*  If you could just scroll down. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=658.98s)]
*  Question here from Dan Berger. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=661.9399999999999s)]
*  From the Epoch Times, Hamas has reportedly revised its death count to reflect that three [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=667.6999999999999s)]
*  quarters of those killed in Gaza were men of military age, far from the women and children [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=676.58s)]
*  narrative that they've used during this war. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=684.02s)]
*  Has the government confirmed that Hamas has actually issued those revised figures? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=687.3s)]
*  And if so, what is the comment? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=693.78s)]
*  Thank you for that question, Dan. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=696.02s)]
*  Israel, the Israeli government's comment is that Hamas is a genocidal, murderous, Islamist, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=697.6999999999999s)]
*  terrorist organization who cannot be trusted for anything. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=704.3399999999999s)]
*  By its very nature, Hamas as a terrorist organization, releases falsehoods. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=709.38s)]
*  Everything that comes out of Hamas is almost definitely a lie, a non-truth, a half-truth, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=715.6999999999999s)]
*  and they have sought to use this PR campaign as a specific area the way they believe they can win [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=724.5s)]
*  against Israel. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=731.94s)]
*  But it is at the expense of their own people. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=732.66s)]
*  This was a war which was designed by Hamas to maximize casualties on their own people. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=735.62s)]
*  So Israel knows that, of course. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=743.46s)]
*  Many of the world leaders and world population know that as well, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=747.0600000000001s)]
*  but it doesn't change the fact that Hamas has designed this war [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=751.3s)]
*  to maximize the number of civilian casualties. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=754.9s)]
*  Okay, next question is from Maria Finoschina from RT International, and you are saying that... [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=759.62s)]
*  Okay, there's a question here. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=771.3s)]
*  Let me just read your question. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=772.9799999999999s)]
*  Your question is that Israel's interior minister Moshe El-Berl, you're saying that announced [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=774.98s)]
*  recent months 16 planes carrying gars and resonance have departed from Amman airport [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=781.94s)]
*  in the south of the country, and they've left as part of a voluntary relocation of Palestinians [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=788.1s)]
*  from the strip. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=793.3000000000001s)]
*  Could you please elaborate? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=794.98s)]
*  Who are these people? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=796.34s)]
*  How many are there? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=797.22s)]
*  Where are they going? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=799.0600000000001s)]
*  Who is sponsoring the trip? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=800.1s)]
*  How does this mechanism work at all? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=801.46s)]
*  Are Gazans willing to leave Gaza reaching out to the army or Israeli authorities contacting them? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=802.66s)]
*  Thank you, Maria, for that question. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=812.42s)]
*  I don't have any details particularly of the issue which you are talking about, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=814.9s)]
*  but I can address that President Trump's idea for the future of Gaza, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=819.86s)]
*  together, which has been welcomed by Israel, talked about voluntary relocation, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=825.7s)]
*  voluntary relocation. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=830.58s)]
*  Israel believes that many, many people, many, many Gazans would like to get out of harm's way. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=832.58s)]
*  It is Hamas that have stopped them leaving the strip. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=839.54s)]
*  If they were given the opportunity, they would take that opportunity to voluntarily leave. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=843.38s)]
*  So, if they were given the opportunity, they would take that opportunity to voluntarily leave. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=848.98s)]
*  So, Israel most definitely welcomes President Trump's out of the box thinking, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=852.82s)]
*  and that's all I have to say on that particular issue. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=858.1800000000001s)]
*  Another question here is from Slava Tartakovsky from RIA, Novosti news agency. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=862.1800000000001s)]
*  Can you confirm media reports regarding anti-missile batteries which have been delivered to Israel? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=876.9799999999999s)]
*  How do you assess the prospects of a US strike on Iran given unprecedented military buildup [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=887.3s)]
*  of US in the region? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=892.3399999999999s)]
*  Thank you for that question, Slava. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=894.7399999999999s)]
*  I too have seen those reports, but we haven't got anything official to share with you, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=897.14s)]
*  and I've given you our forthright policy when it comes to Iran. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=902.02s)]
*  And of course, this issue of Iran is most definitely on the agenda for President Trump [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=906.5s)]
*  and our Prime Minister Netanyahu today in the White House. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=913.14s)]
*  Further question from Alistair Bunkle. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=918.26s)]
*  Can I press you? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=919.6999999999999s)]
*  Do you have concrete evidence that some of these medics were Hamas and will you publish it? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=920.42s)]
*  Thank you for that question, Alistair. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=924.98s)]
*  I do find it remarkable that it seems like from where I'm standing that organizations like yourself [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=927.94s)]
*  and you, Alistair, as part of Sky News, seem always willing to believe Hamas first before [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=938.42s)]
*  the democratic elected government of the state of Israel. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=946.02s)]
*  I find that bizarre, I must tell you, because we have a government with checks and balances, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=950.42s)]
*  with free media, which investigates almost everything which happens in this country. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=956.34s)]
*  And that is why almost everything which comes out of Hamas is untrue. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=963.3000000000001s)]
*  The results of the investigation will be shared very, very shortly by the independent arm [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=969.38s)]
*  of the IDF, where the issue is being most closely investigated, and those results of those [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=977.3000000000001s)]
*  in that investigation will be released shortly. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=985.3000000000001s)]
*  As I mentioned to you before, the reason why this is an issue is because again and again Hamas [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=989.62s)]
*  and other terrorist organizations have misused the emergency services. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=996.4200000000001s)]
*  They've used them as their own arm. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1001.46s)]
*  They've ferried their own terrorists inside, away from, to try and escape from Israel. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1003.22s)]
*  They've used them as transport, and Israel is aware of this. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1011.6999999999999s)]
*  Indeed, on October the 7th, ambulances were used to ferry our hostages, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1016.1s)]
*  not to help them, to hospitals. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1023.54s)]
*  Again, not to be treated, but very often to be killed in those hospitals. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1026.58s)]
*  So our independent investigation will release its findings shortly, and I've given you a [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1032.18s)]
*  comprehensive answer on that. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1039.94s)]
*  Okay, could you just go up for a second? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1044.02s)]
*  There's a question, another question from Hannah Julian from the Jewish press. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1045.46s)]
*  When is the Prime Minister expected to return to Israel? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1051.8600000000001s)]
*  We will share that information with you pretty shortly, Hannah. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1054.42s)]
*  Thank you for asking that question. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1058.9s)]
*  If we just go up a second, there was a question here from Joel Pollack. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1060.5s)]
*  Is the current situation regarding tariffs and the United States an opportunity to break [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1066.98s)]
*  down the power of monopolies that maintain high prices and continue the economic reforms [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1072.82s)]
*  which the Prime Minister is known? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1078.66s)]
*  Thank you for that question, Joel. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1081.22s)]
*  Following the meeting at the White House, there will be press statements in the usual way, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1083.7s)]
*  and no doubt that issue will be addressed directly by the Prime Minister and the President. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1089.8600000000001s)]
*  Just go down, just sorry, go up rather, go up, excuse me. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1095.46s)]
*  Okay, I've taken that one, just go up a bit more. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1101.7800000000002s)]
*  Another go, sorry, Dan Berger, I dealt with that one. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1105.94s)]
*  Just go right to the end. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1112.2600000000002s)]
*  Okay, BBC News there, just at the end there, I can see. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1114.1000000000001s)]
*  Okay, Iona Hampson from BBC News. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1120.9s)]
*  Your question is, do you now accept that the two British MPs who were returned [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1123.62s)]
*  were on a fish trip, and what response do you have to the UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1128.8999999999999s)]
*  saying their treatment was unacceptable from Iona Hampson at the BBC? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1136.1799999999998s)]
*  Thank you for that question, Iona. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1142.4199999999998s)]
*  This issue was dealt with comprehensively actually by a statement put out by the [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1145.3799999999999s)]
*  Israel's embassy in London just yesterday. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1150.5s)]
*  A carbo trip, a trip which is run by the Council for the Advancement of Arab-British [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1155.14s)]
*  Understanding is not an official delegation, it is not a state-to-state visit. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1163.46s)]
*  A carbo, unfortunately, is an organisation that has put out an entrenched view of, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1170.1s)]
*  a false view of the most radical elements of the pro-Palestinian narrative, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1176.74s)]
*  by no means a pro-peace narrative, always trying to just perpetuate the conflict here rather than [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1184.58s)]
*  ever seeking to solve it. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1192.58s)]
*  So I would point you, Iona, to the comprehensive statement which the Israeli embassy in London [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1196.1s)]
*  released yesterday regarding the issue of these, of those two members of parliament. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1203.06s)]
*  And let me just further add to that, that, you know, we're fighting jihadi terrorism [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1209.54s)]
*  in this country, we're on the front lines of this battle, and those who seek to come here [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1216.98s)]
*  to show some sort of sympathy with these jihadists, not in favour of peace, not in [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1224.1799999999998s)]
*  favour of co-existence, not in favour of ending this conflict, but simply to perpetuate this [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1230.42s)]
*  conflict, Israel will simply not allow entry of those sorts of individuals or entities that are [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1236.3400000000001s)]
*  acting against this state and our citizens. I don't think any country would. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1243.7s)]
*  So people that promote calls for the boycott of Israel, or malign this country with false [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1249.14s)]
*  accusations, or call for sanctions against our government and our elected officials, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1254.9s)]
*  it is perfectly within the rights of this country. Indeed, it is normal, I would say, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1261.7s)]
*  in accordance with the law that these two people were denied entry into Israel by the Minister of [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1269.0600000000002s)]
*  the Interior, have checked their records, they have a long list of accusations, false accusations, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1276.26s)]
*  false claims against this country, and they've been actively involved in promoting sanctions [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1285.3s)]
*  against our government ministers and supporting campaigns aimed at boycotting this country. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1292.74s)]
*  Now I would remind you that Britain has also barred, in the past, Israeli government members [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1299.8600000000001s)]
*  of parliament from visiting Israel. This was in the past, in the last decade or so, maybe even longer [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1308.82s)]
*  ago. So these two members of parliament chose not to exercise their right under Israeli law to [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1316.66s)]
*  petition the court to reconsider their decision. They were offered hotel accommodation, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1325.7s)]
*  courteously, which they both declined. This would have been under the cost of Israeli taxpayer. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1330.98s)]
*  The cost of their return flight was met by the state of Israel. So we know that this visit was [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1338.66s)]
*  intended to provoke anti-Israel activities at a time when Israel is at war and under attack from [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1345.3s)]
*  these vicious Islamists on seven fronts. The purpose of these visits are to harm Israel [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1351.62s)]
*  and our citizens and spread falsehoods about this country. So therefore, we have both the authority [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1360.26s)]
*  and the duty to prevent the entry of these sorts of individuals whose presence in this country is [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1367.4599999999998s)]
*  intended to cause harm to our citizens. It's what any self-respecting country would do and we are [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPlHUT0uUc&t=1373.86s)]
