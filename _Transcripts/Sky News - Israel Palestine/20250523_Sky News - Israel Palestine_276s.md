# Gaza enduring 'atrocious death and destruction', UN boss warns as he demands Israel lets in aid
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw)
*  Let's turn to the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=0.0s)]
*  And limited aid deliveries resume this week, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=4.32s)]
*  but the United Nations has warned that it's too little too late. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=6.96s)]
*  Speaking this afternoon, the UN Secretary-General, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=10.44s)]
*  Antonio Guterres, said the amount of aid being allowed into Gaza [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=12.84s)]
*  by Israel is nowhere near enough. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=16.32s)]
*  Hospitals in Gaza are struggling to cope with new mothers [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=19.0s)]
*  unable to feed them themselves or their babies. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=22.72s)]
*  A warning that this report from our Middle East correspondent, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=26.72s)]
*  Alistair Bunkle, contains images of malnourished babies and children [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=29.32s)]
*  which you may find distressing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=33.68s)]
*  The Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza is barely standing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=37.36s)]
*  Inside, the wards are covered in the debris of airstrikes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=42.28s)]
*  It was one of the largest hospitals in northern Gaza. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  It is now in ruins. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  The streets and buildings nearby have been totally obliterated. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=52.16s)]
*  The Israeli offensive, increasing in its intensity every day, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=57.12s)]
*  has forced four major hospitals in Gaza to stop work over the past week, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=61.959999999999994s)]
*  worsening an already desperate medical crisis. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  The Rantisi Hospital was a small clinic specialising in children's care, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=73.96s)]
*  but now has to take patients from right across Gaza. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=79.4s)]
*  They are overwhelmed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=82.6s)]
*  Today we receive between 300 and 500 cases daily, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=87.12s)]
*  with approximately 10% requiring admission. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=91.2s)]
*  This volume of inpatient cases far exceeds the capacity of Rantisi Hospital, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=94.72s)]
*  as the facility is not equipped to accommodate such large numbers. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=99.72s)]
*  The blockade has also created a massive shortage in baby formula. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  New mothers are struggling to breastfeed, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=110.92s)]
*  unable to produce milk through a lack of food themselves, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=113.4s)]
*  and then their babies don't get the vital nutrients they need. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=116.8s)]
*  It is a lethal spiral. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=120.84s)]
*  This is what Aya looked like shortly after she was born. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=123.56s)]
*  She is now three months old and dangerously thin. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=127.96s)]
*  Her skin stretches over her cheekbones and eye sockets, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=137.04s)]
*  across her gaunt, pale face. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=141.2s)]
*  Her nappy is too big for her emaciated little body. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=144.56s)]
*  My daughter was born at a normal weight, 3.5 kilograms, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=151.16s)]
*  but as the war went on, she kept losing weight. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=155.44s)]
*  My breast milk wasn't good enough. It gave her diarrhoea. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=160.76s)]
*  Formula, same thing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=165.04s)]
*  Her condition is serious. I don't want to lose her, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=167.12s)]
*  because I lost my husband and she's all I have left of him. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=170.12s)]
*  I don't want to lose her. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=173.52s)]
*  I just really want her to get treated. That's it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=175.32s)]
*  The UN Secretary-General said today that no aid has reached the north of Gaza yet, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=182.52s)]
*  and he has accused Israel of preventing essential items from getting in. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=188.32s)]
*  Strict quotas are being imposed on the goods we distribute, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=193.0s)]
*  along with unnecessary delay procedures. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=197.0s)]
*  Other essentials, including fuel, shelter, cooking gas [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=201.0s)]
*  and water purification supplies, are prohibited. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=205.0s)]
*  We continue to... [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=209.0s)]
*  Tens of thousands are now being driven to the south of Gaza [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=211.0s)]
*  as the north becomes too dangerous. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=215.0s)]
*  It has become a dangerous place. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=219.0s)]
*  It has become a city of canvas. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=221.08s)]
*  What remains are their lives and belongings, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=223.08s)]
*  now in small tents, pitched on stony ground. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=226.08s)]
*  We couldn't take all our belongings because of the Israeli army's presence. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=233.08s)]
*  The constant airstrikes, the leaflets being dropped and the evacuation orders. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=236.08s)]
*  The intensity of the bombardment forced us to flee. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=241.08s)]
*  We couldn't even think about taking our food stores, let alone our mattresses. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=244.08s)]
*  This, according to government ministers, is Israel's strategy [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  to push the population into a small section of Gaza [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  and then expect them to leave when life becomes unlivable. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=256.16s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu now says that the war won't end until that is achieved. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=261.16s)]
*  Alistair Bungle, Sky News, in Jerusalem. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvQ8xr_pHNw&t=268.16s)]
