# The Israeli military has "nothing to hide"
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY)
*  So our investigation is taking place right now. It's going to be very thorough. It will be coming out very, very shortly. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=0.0s)]
*  We have nothing to hide whatsoever and the thorough investigation, the results of which should come out very, very shortly. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=7.0s)]
*  But whatever happens, let's remember. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=14.0s)]
*  Can I just ask you another particular question? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=16.0s)]
*  Do you have evidence that they identified the Maz Hamas before they opened fire or after they opened fire? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=18.0s)]
*  I will answer that question, but I must tell you firstly that emergency vehicles should be used to save lives. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=27.0s)]
*  Hamas has turned them into getaway cars for killers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=34.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean you can shoot at every ambulance. I'm just trying to get to the heart of this question. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=38.0s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=44.0s)]
*  You said you'd answer it. Were they identified as Hamas, these six Hamas you've identified, were they identified before these troops opened fire or after? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=45.0s)]
*  So that's why Hamas themselves use ambulances to hide their identity. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=57.0s)]
*  Right. So it was after. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=62.0s)]
*  No, while our soldiers stake out Hamas terrorist squads, Hamas hides behind civilians and then cries foul when terrorists are targeted. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=64.0s)]
*  Let me be clear. This incident happened in a rural zone in combat against a group that uses human shields as a policy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=74.0s)]
*  Were they identified before or after? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=85.0s)]
*  Among those killed were six Hamas terrorists. That is not speculation. It is confirmation. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=87.0s)]
*  The IDF is investigating the incident in rough or thoroughly, transparently and in real time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=94.0s)]
*  Hamas on the other hand investigates nothing, admits nothing and abuses everything. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=100.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=105.0s)]
*  No army in the world does more to avoid civilian casualties than the IDF. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNTqc-2mLcY&t=106.0s)]
