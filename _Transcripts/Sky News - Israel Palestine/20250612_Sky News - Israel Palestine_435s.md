# In full: Netanyahu says Iran is a 'threat to Israel's very survival'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ)
*  Moments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=0.0s)]
*  back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=6.96s)]
*  This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=11.66s)]
*  For decades, the tyrants of Tehran have brazenly, openly called for Israel's destruction. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=17.32s)]
*  They've backed up their genocidal rhetoric with a program to develop nuclear weapons. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=24.1s)]
*  In recent years, Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atom bombs. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=29.94s)]
*  In recent months, Iran has taken steps that it has never taken before – steps to weaponize [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=37.94s)]
*  this enriched uranium. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=44.22s)]
*  And if not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=45.7s)]
*  It could be a year, it could be within a few months, less than a year. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  This is a clear and present danger to Israel's very survival. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=55.58s)]
*  Eighty years ago, the Jewish people were the victims of a Holocaust perpetrated by the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=59.78s)]
*  Nazi regime. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=65.62s)]
*  Today, the Jewish state refuses to be a victim of a nuclear Holocaust perpetrated by the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=67.02s)]
*  Iranian regime. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=73.58s)]
*  Now, as Prime Minister, I've made it clear time and again, Israel will never allow those [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=74.58s)]
*  who call for our annihilation to develop the means to achieve that goal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=81.64s)]
*  Tonight, Israel backs those words with action. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=86.08s)]
*  We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment program. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=90.16s)]
*  We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear weaponization program. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=93.66s)]
*  We targeted Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=97.72s)]
*  We targeted Iran's leading nuclear scientists working on the Iranian bomb. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=101.32s)]
*  We also struck at the heart of Iran's ballistic missile program. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  Last year, Iran fired 300 ballistic missiles at Israel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=110.46s)]
*  Each of these missiles carries a ton of explosives and threatens the lives of hundreds of people. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=114.82s)]
*  Soon, those missiles could carry a nuclear payload, threatening the lives not of hundreds, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  but of millions. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=128.06s)]
*  Iran is gearing up to produce 10,000 of those ballistic missiles within three years. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=129.7s)]
*  Now just imagine, imagine 10,000 tons of TNT landing on a country the size of New Jersey. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=136.38s)]
*  This is an intolerable threat. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=145.22s)]
*  It too must be stopped. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  Iran is now working on what it calls the new plan to destroy Israel. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=149.7s)]
*  You see, the old plan failed. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=154.1s)]
*  Iran and its proxies try to encircle Israel with a ring of fire and to attack us with [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=157.22s)]
*  the horrible attack of October 7th. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=162.18s)]
*  But the people of Israel, the soldiers of Israel, rose like lions to defend our country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=165.22s)]
*  We crushed Hamas. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=170.94s)]
*  We devastated Hezbollah. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=172.18s)]
*  We hit Iranian proxies in Syria and Yemen. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=173.94s)]
*  And when Iran directly attacked us twice last year, we struck back inside Iran itself. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=176.94s)]
*  Yet in defending ourselves, we also defend others. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=183.02s)]
*  We defend our Arab neighbors. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=186.76s)]
*  They too have suffered from Iran's campaign of chaos and carnage. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=188.62s)]
*  Our actions against Iran's proxy Hezbollah led to the establishment of a new government [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=193.12s)]
*  in Lebanon and the collapse of Assad's murderous regime in Syria. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=197.88s)]
*  The peoples of those two countries now have a chance for a different future, a better [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=202.96s)]
*  future. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=208.04s)]
*  So too do the brave people of Iran. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  And I have a message for them. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=211.88s)]
*  Our fight is not with you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=214.1s)]
*  Our fight is with the brutal dictatorship that has oppressed you for 46 years. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=216.46s)]
*  I believe that the day of your liberation is near. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=222.24s)]
*  And when that happens, the great friendship between our two ancient peoples will flourish [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=225.44000000000003s)]
*  once again. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  I want to assure the civilized world, we will not let the world's most dangerous regime [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  get the world's most dangerous weapons. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=238.8s)]
*  And Iran plans to give those weapons, nuclear weapons, to its terrorist proxies. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=241.56s)]
*  That would make the nightmare of nuclear terrorism all too real. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=246.82000000000002s)]
*  The increasing range of Iran's ballistic missiles would bring that nuclear nightmare [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=251.08s)]
*  to the cities of Europe and eventually to America. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  Remember, Iran calls Israel the small Satan. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=260.08000000000004s)]
*  It calls America the great Satan. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=263.74s)]
*  And this is why for decades it's led millions in the chance of death to Israel and death [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=266.72s)]
*  to America. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=272.58000000000004s)]
*  Today, Israel is responding to those genocidal calls with action and with a call of our own. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=274.64s)]
*  Long live Israel and long live America. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=282.08s)]
*  Our action will help make the world a much safer place. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=286.12s)]
*  I want to thank President Trump for his leadership in confronting Iran's nuclear weapons program. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=290.24s)]
*  He has made clear time and again that Iran cannot have a nuclear enrichment program. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=296.12s)]
*  Today, it is clear that Iran is just buying for time. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=302.16s)]
*  It refuses to agree to this basic requirement of peaceful nations. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  That is why we have no choice but to act. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=311.92s)]
*  And act now. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=314.66s)]
*  The hardest decision any leader has to make is to thwart a danger before it is fully materialized. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=316.16s)]
*  Nearly a century ago, facing the Nazis, a generation of leaders failed to act in time. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=324.92s)]
*  They were paralyzed by the horrors of World War I. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=332.22s)]
*  They were determined to avoid war at all costs. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  And they got the worst war ever. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=338.36s)]
*  They adopted a policy of appeasement. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=341.32s)]
*  They closed their eyes and ears to all the warning signs. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=343.64s)]
*  That failure to act resulted in World War II, the deadliest war in history. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=347.56s)]
*  It claimed the lives of 60 million, including 6 million Jews, a third of my people. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=353.76s)]
*  After that war, the Jewish people and the Jewish state vowed, never again. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=360.56s)]
*  Well, never again is now. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=366.0s)]
*  Today, Israel has shown that we have learned the lessons of history. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=369.4s)]
*  When enemies vow to destroy you, believe them. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=373.96s)]
*  When enemies build weapons of mass death, stop them. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=377.58s)]
*  As the Bible teaches us, when someone comes to kill you, rise and act first. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=381.52s)]
*  This is exactly what Israel has done today. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=387.88s)]
*  We have risen like lions to defend ourselves. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=390.5s)]
*  Over 3,000 years ago, Moses gave the people of Israel a message that has steeled their [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=394.4s)]
*  resolve ever since. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=399.64s)]
*  Be strong and courageous, he said. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=401.52s)]
*  Today, our strong and courageous soldiers and people stand together to defend ourselves [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=404.32s)]
*  against those who seek our destruction. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=410.24s)]
*  And by defending ourselves, we defend many others and we roll back a murderous tyranny. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=413.0s)]
*  Generations from now, history will record that our generation stood its ground, acted [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=419.24s)]
*  in time and secured our common future. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=425.32s)]
*  May God bless Israel. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=429.32s)]
*  May God bless the forces of civilization everywhere. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjWm-atw3eQ&t=431.12s)]
