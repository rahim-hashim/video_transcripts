Video Description: Israel and Hamas said ceasefire talks have resumed in Qatar - even as Israeli forces ramped up a bombing campaign and mobilised for a massive new ground assault. 

The talks come as Israel launches a new military operation in Gaza, which it says is aimed at increasing pressure on Hamas to release its remaining hostages.  

Officials in the territory say more than 100 people have been killed in a series of airstrikes over the last 24 hours and more than 250 since Thursday.

# Israel and Hamas resume ceasefire talks after 'extensive strikes' on Gaza
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E)
*  The Israeli operation is now focusing on Deir al-Bala, a town in central Gaza where the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=0.0s)]
*  IDF has not yet entered in the last 19 months of war. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=7.12s)]
*  They are attacking from the air and ground, and Israeli tanks are reportedly advancing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=10.84s)]
*  to the east of the city. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=15.8s)]
*  The assault is so fierce, though, that it's too dangerous for many rescue teams to reach, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=18.04s)]
*  and very few images are coming out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=22.56s)]
*  Current increase in violence is killing civilians, it's killing women and children, and it appears [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=24.92s)]
*  to be completely indiscriminate attacks on whole swathes of the population. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=31.68s)]
*  So it is a massive onslaught again on the whole population of Gaza. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=37.08s)]
*  Jabalia in the north is also under attack again. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  This was moments after an airstrike. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  The Israeli military hit and flattened an entire residential block, he says. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=50.48s)]
*  Bodies are trapped underneath. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=58.31999999999999s)]
*  They are digging with their bare hands to try and reach them. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  Thousands are now fleeing in the blazing heat, on the move again, but with no idea where [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=65.36s)]
*  it is safe to head to. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=71.0s)]
*  Most traveling on donkey and cart. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=73.72s)]
*  Fuel is scarce. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=76.19999999999999s)]
*  But some have to make the hot journey on foot. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=77.92s)]
*  They are weighed down by the months of war and with bags stuffed full with whatever they [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  could carry, through miles of streets destroyed on every side, forced out of their homes for [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  the umpteenth time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=95.04s)]
*  Honestly, I have no idea where I'm going or where to take my wife and children. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=97.04s)]
*  The situation overnight was horrific and as you can see I have kids. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=104.4s)]
*  We left very late last night. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=108.48s)]
*  The bombing and killing didn't stop. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=110.0s)]
*  The number of injuries kept rising and bodies are now lying in the streets. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=111.96s)]
*  What happened overnight was criminal. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=118.76s)]
*  This isn't normal warfare. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=120.24s)]
*  This is indiscriminate bombing over our heads. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=121.9s)]
*  We all slept under a bed just trying to stay alive and ready to leave when the chance came. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=124.64s)]
*  And even when we left, the quadcopters kept firing at us, but there's nothing I can do. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=129.48s)]
*  The IDF has dropped these leaflets over northern Gaza with a biblical reference to Moses and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=135.64s)]
*  the parting of the waves. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=140.72s)]
*  People of Gaza, the Israeli army is coming, the final sentence threatens. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  In Baghdad, leaders from the Arab League met to discuss Gaza and called on the world to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  help stop the Israeli offensive. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=155.42s)]
*  Israel's reckless and aggressive policy in Palestine, Syria and Lebanon is pushing the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=158.4s)]
*  entire region into endless cycles of confrontation. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=166.56s)]
*  We need a permanent ceasefire now. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=171.88s)]
*  The unconditional release of all hostages now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=176.36s)]
*  And the free flow of humanitarian aid ending the blockade now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=180.76s)]
*  Hamas and Israel say they've resumed ceasefire talks in Qatar today. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=186.84s)]
*  But after so many failed goes, few have any expectation of a breakthrough. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYFoK6pY42E&t=191.28s)]
