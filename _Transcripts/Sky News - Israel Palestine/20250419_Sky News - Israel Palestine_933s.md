# Netanyahu 'insists' on not ending Israel-Hamas war until Gaza threat is gone
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ)
*  On behalf of all of you, my heartfelt condolences to the family of Raleh Nasr, a blessed memory [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=0.0s)]
*  who was killed in battle today in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=16.36s)]
*  The entire people of Israel mourns together with the dear family. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=19.36s)]
*  The entire state salutes this hero. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=23.52s)]
*  I would like to extend the speedy recovery wishes for those soldiers who were injured [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=26.76s)]
*  in battle. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=33.2s)]
*  I would like to strengthen the soldiers and commanders. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=34.2s)]
*  I've instructed the IEDF to act aggressively, to react aggressively. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=36.92s)]
*  We are in a war of resurrection, the war of seven fronts, and there are very heavy prices [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=43.68000000000001s)]
*  to pay in this war. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=49.74s)]
*  And every such loss means an entire world that's been lost. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  As a nation that seeks to live, we have no choice but to continue and fight for our mere [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=55.88s)]
*  survival until we reach victory. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=62.68s)]
*  Citizens of Israel, as your Prime Minister, I will not give in. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=66.4s)]
*  I will not give in to the murderers who carried out the worst massacre the Jewish people have [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=71.6s)]
*  experienced since the Holocaust. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Because such a, if I will surrender like that, it will risk this country, it will risk all [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=79.64s)]
*  of you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=84.96s)]
*  We are in the final stages of the campaign and we need patience in order to win. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=85.96s)]
*  And if we give in to what Hamas wants right now, all the great achievements that we've [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=91.96s)]
*  reached thanks to our soldiers, thanks to those who have been killed, thanks to those [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=98.0s)]
*  who have been injured, all of these achievements will simply go down the drain. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  Since the beginning of the war, we have heard people calling to put an end to the war and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=107.72s)]
*  to surrender. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  And we've been hearing more and more of these voices recently. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=115.64s)]
*  If I were to listen to these calls, we would not have entered Ra'afah, we would not have [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=118.04s)]
*  conquered the Philadelphia corridor, we wouldn't have carried out the beeper operation, we [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=123.0s)]
*  wouldn't have killed Sinwar, Deft Haneeh and Nasrallah, we wouldn't have led to the conditions [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  that led to the toppling of the Assad regime, and we wouldn't have changed the face of the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=133.76s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=139.8s)]
*  We simply have continued to live under this existential threat. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=140.84s)]
*  So now I'd like to say a few words about Iran. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  I am committed to preventing them from achieving nuclear weapons. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=149.08s)]
*  I'm relentless about that and I will not withdraw from that, not even one millimeter. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=153.84s)]
*  But the most amusing thing is to hear the criticism of all those who have objected to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  everything I've done over the years in order to delay their nuclear program. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  Without these actions, Iran would have had nuclear weapons already a decade ago. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=172.72s)]
*  But many of these people who are speaking today have systematically objected to all [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  my activities and to my hardline policy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=184.72s)]
*  So I guess there is no limit to hypocrisy as for Iran's proxy in Gaza. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  If we would not, if we will not finally eliminate all the military capabilities of Hamas, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=193.72s)]
*  the next October 7th and the next abductions are merely a matter of time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=199.44s)]
*  Hamas are saying that they're going to do it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=204.36s)]
*  They intend to do it and they're working on doing it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=207.32s)]
*  If we keep the Hamas regime in Gaza, it will be a tremendous defeat for Israel and a huge [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=211.44s)]
*  victory for Iran. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=218.52s)]
*  Over this past weekend, once again, Hamas rejected a proposal that could have led to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=219.84s)]
*  the release of half of the living hostages who are still held captive in Gaza and the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  return of many of the bodies of the hostages. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  But what they want is to remain in government. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=233.36s)]
*  They are also demanding complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the rehabilitation [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  of Gaza with immense sums of money coming in will help them rearm themselves. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  But we wish to convey a message to all of Israel's enemies. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=247.88s)]
*  If that happens, it will give a message that by abducting Israelis, you can get Israel [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  to surrender and give in. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=259.44s)]
*  And it is a clear cut message that terrorism pays off. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=261.28s)]
*  And this will undermine the safety and security of the whole world. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=264.8s)]
*  And under these conditions, even the important vision of President Trump will not be realized. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=268.84s)]
*  The vision that will change the destiny of Gaza and will help us live with security. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=275.56s)]
*  So I insist on not putting an end of this war of revival and resurrection before we [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  guarantee that the Gaza Strip will not pose a threat on Israel once again. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=289.4s)]
*  Those people in Israel who are calling out irresponsibly to end to the war and to agree [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=294.68s)]
*  to the terms of surrender of Hamas, what are they doing? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  They are encouraging and echoing verbatim the Hamas propaganda and echoing their psychological [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=303.52s)]
*  warfare against us and the families. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=311.68s)]
*  And they're not bringing the release of hostages any closer. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=314.2s)]
*  They are pushing it further away, leaving them there for longer. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=317.68s)]
*  The terms suggested by Hamas are not new. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  They have demanded these surrender terms time and again in all of their negotiations. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  But which Israeli responsible leader could accept such terms after October 7th? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=332.88s)]
*  I can't. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=338.32s)]
*  And I'm sure that you wouldn't be able as well. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=339.12s)]
*  Those who are asking us, who are calling us to surrender to the demands of Hamas, they [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=341.6s)]
*  say you need to leave now. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=346.32s)]
*  You need to cheat Hamas, promise that you won't resume the fighting. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=348.88s)]
*  And after they give back all the hostages, Hamas, you can resume the war. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=352.4s)]
*  The greatest absurdity, the greatest absurdity is that they are saying that on TV [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=356.32s)]
*  studios out in the open while Hamas is watching them, you understand, they're actually saying, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=362.64s)]
*  say to Hamas, we are informing you that we're lying to you and you need to agree to that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=368.72s)]
*  Hamas, they're a bunch of despicable murderers, but they're definitely not stupid. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=375.12s)]
*  They demand binding international guarantees that will not allow this illusion of deceit that all [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=380.24s)]
*  those self-appointed experts are suggesting on TV studios. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=387.76s)]
*  They have no idea how the international system operates. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=391.68s)]
*  No one, definitely not the US, but also not China or Russia or any other members of the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=395.2s)]
*  Security Council. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=400.8s)]
*  Nobody will cooperate with such a scam. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=401.92s)]
*  And that will mean that it's impossible to resume the war. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=404.8s)]
*  We won't have any kind of legitimacy to do so. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=407.76s)]
*  You need to remember how quickly Israel lost its international legitimacy in this war, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=410.64s)]
*  which is the most just war in our history after the monsters of Hamas murdered over 24 hours, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=417.44s)]
*  over over 1200 Israelis and abducted over 250 Israelis. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  But things got turned against us very quickly and there was diplomatic pressure on us and we [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=429.12s)]
*  suffered from arms embargo from some of our best friends. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=435.12s)]
*  And we are dealing with allegations of genocide in the international arena as we're speaking. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  So let me clarify. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=445.2s)]
*  There is no fake commitment. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=446.8s)]
*  If we promise not to fight, then we won't be able to resume the war. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=448.56s)]
*  And Hamas is demanding full withdrawal of the IDF from the Gaza Strip, from the security strip [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=454.0s)]
*  from the Philadelphia corridor that protects Israelis from Hamas. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=460.88s)]
*  I would like to ask you, did our soldiers, did our fighters fight in vain? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=465.12s)]
*  Were our soldiers killed and injured in vain in Lebanon, in Syria? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=470.48s)]
*  We also had security zones in order to protect the residents of the North of Israel. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=474.56s)]
*  And the meaning of withdrawal from the security zone in the Gaza Strip means that very quickly [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=479.92s)]
*  Hamas will rehabilitate its army of terrorists and will be able to carry out mass abductions [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=484.96s)]
*  and another massacre. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=490.72s)]
*  It is my duty as prime minister to prevent that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=491.92s)]
*  And indeed, that's what I'm doing. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=494.96s)]
*  I believe that we can bring back our hostages without giving in to the demands of Hamas. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=497.04s)]
*  This is what I've done so far. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=502.64s)]
*  Do you know that in one of the first discussions in the cabinet after the beginning of the war, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=504.4s)]
*  perhaps the first discussion, a senior official in the security establishment said that we will have [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=508.56s)]
*  to get used to the fact that maybe we won't be able to bring back even one hostage. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=513.12s)]
*  I thought differently. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  I believe that the combination of military and diplomatic pressure together will lead [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=520.88s)]
*  to the release of hostages. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=526.56s)]
*  Many people didn't believe that. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=527.76s)]
*  So far, we brought back 196 hostages out of them, 147 still alive. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=529.52s)]
*  We still have 24 living hostages in the Gaza Strip and 35 hostages who have been killed. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=535.6s)]
*  We haven't completed our mission yet, and we're going to do so without surrendering to Hamas. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=542.56s)]
*  Since the outbreak of the war, in recent days, as well, my wife and myself have met with many [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=548.16s)]
*  of the hostage families and we've spoken with them. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=555.6s)]
*  We will continue to meet with all of them, as we've done since the beginning of the war. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=558.08s)]
*  I meet with the people. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=563.0400000000001s)]
*  I understand the terrible torment and suffering of the families, the parents, the siblings, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=565.6s)]
*  the children, the wives. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=572.64s)]
*  I can feel their tremendous pain and I hear how their heart cries out and it tears my heart apart. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  And we are going to increase our pressure over Hamas until we achieve all the war's goals. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=582.4000000000001s)]
*  And let me once again emphasize, we will not give up on any hostage, whether dead or alive. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=588.32s)]
*  We are determined to bring them all back home. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=594.24s)]
*  Citizens of Israel, we are in the midst of a war spanning several arenas and it is an [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=598.0s)]
*  unprecedented one. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=606.0s)]
*  Thanks to the heroism of our courageous soldiers and thanks to the spirit of our people and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=607.0400000000001s)]
*  to the policy, the hardline policy taken by the government I lead. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=612.88s)]
*  We have achieved some major achievements, but we haven't completed the war yet and we [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=617.76s)]
*  are determined to do so as we end the holiday of liberty, of freedom, and as we begin the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=622.88s)]
*  before Holocaust Remembrance Day and Memorial Day for fallen soldiers, which bring us all [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=630.32s)]
*  together. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=636.0s)]
*  I'd like to say we are going to face many challenges, but we can overcome them because [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=636.32s)]
*  we will do so together with determination, with belief, and with the great spirit in [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=641.6s)]
*  the hearts of our nation. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=646.96s)]
*  Together we will stand, together we will fight. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=648.32s)]
*  That was the Prime Minister of Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  war is going to continue in Gaza, as he says, until Hamas are no longer able to control [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  that region, says that the Israeli army cannot give in while there is still a threat in Gaza. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=666.88s)]
*  Let's bring in our correspondent, Nicole Johnston, who has been listening to the Prime [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=672.88s)]
*  Minister speaking there in the last few minutes. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=676.7199999999999s)]
*  So, Nicole, Prime Minister Netanyahu making it very clear that the fighting, the war will [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=679.3599999999999s)]
*  continue in Gaza, they will continue to strike Hamas, and he says, as he said since the very [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=685.28s)]
*  beginning of this, they will try and bring all the hostages home. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=696.9599999999999s)]
*  This was clearly Netanyahu trying to make his case for continuing the war in Gaza. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  He is feeling under pressure. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=702.7199999999999s)]
*  There are protests in Israel, including one tonight, so he knows that he needs to once [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=704.7199999999999s)]
*  again lay out the reasons for continuing the war inside Gaza. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=710.7199999999999s)]
*  Now, we did have an Israeli proposal this week for a ceasefire. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=715.3599999999999s)]
*  It was a proposal that would have meant 10 hostages were released for a 45-day ceasefire [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=718.88s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=725.68s)]
*  That was rejected by Hamas. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=726.16s)]
*  Hamas's position is that it won't lay down its arms. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=728.16s)]
*  It wants to go back to the phase two of the original ceasefire agreement that Israel [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=731.68s)]
*  rejected. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=737.68s)]
*  And under that phase two, Israel would have withdrawn from the Gaza Strip. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=738.24s)]
*  But Israeli Prime Minister has made it very clear that that is not going to happen. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=743.04s)]
*  And if anything, all of the indications and the noises that we've had over the last few [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=747.36s)]
*  weeks is that Israel intends to stay in the Gaza Strip. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=752.48s)]
*  They have said that. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=756.48s)]
*  They have expanded the buffer zone inside Gaza. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=757.84s)]
*  Israel calls it a security zone. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=761.28s)]
*  It says that it is necessary to have that security zone to protect the people of Israel. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=763.52s)]
*  Palestinians, of course, inside Gaza will see that as taking more of their land, further [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=769.2s)]
*  reducing the amount of space that they have inside Gaza. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=774.16s)]
*  In some areas, that buffer zone is now three kilometres wide. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=777.52s)]
*  Remembering that the Gaza Strip is only 40 kilometres long and sort of seven to 10 kilometres [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=782.24s)]
*  wide. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=788.0799999999999s)]
*  Israel has also taken another area in the southern part of Gaza. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=789.1999999999999s)]
*  It's called the Morag Corridor that was only completed in the last week. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=795.28s)]
*  So we can see that the Gaza Strip is being bisected by corridors and by buffer zones. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=799.12s)]
*  So once again, the Israeli Prime Minister appealing to the people of Israel to stay [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=805.28s)]
*  with him. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=810.8s)]
*  But we know that he is under a great deal of pressure, that he is having to lay out [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=811.52s)]
*  his case time and time again. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=816.64s)]
*  Overall, this speech was about Gaza, but he did go on to mention Iran as well. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=819.36s)]
*  And he said that Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=824.64s)]
*  Now, he is, of course, referring to the talks that we've had underway in Rome today, talks [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=828.8s)]
*  between the United States and Iran, indirect or proximity talks, they called, about Iran's [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=835.92s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=841.44s)]
*  Israel has made it clear over the last weeks and months and years that it would like to [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=842.8000000000001s)]
*  carry out a strike on Iran. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  It thinks that now is the time to do that, that the Iranian regime is weakened, that [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=850.6400000000001s)]
*  its proxies, Hezbollah, the Houthis, Hamas, have all suffered, that it has lost its main [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=856.08s)]
*  ally in the region, Syria, and that now is a time to prevent Iran from having a nuclear [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=862.24s)]
*  program. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=868.48s)]
*  Now, that is a red line for the Iranians. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=869.36s)]
*  They say that their nuclear program is peaceful, that it is civilian, that they're allowed [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=871.76s)]
*  to have it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=877.28s)]
*  The United States, the other party in this negotiation regarding Iran, its position is [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=878.24s)]
*  quite confusing at this stage. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=884.72s)]
*  Its main envoy, Steve Witkoff, he has said that earlier in the week, he said that Iran [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=886.3199999999999s)]
*  would be allowed to a limited amount of enrichment of its uranium. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=892.8s)]
*  He then backtracked a few days later and said that the program effectively should be dismantled. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=897.2s)]
*  So for the Iranians, there's a great deal of concern about what level of trust they [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=903.28s)]
*  have with the United States. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=908.08s)]
*  It is very low. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=909.76s)]
*  But all of these issues, Gaza and Iran, are clearly weighing on the mind of the Israeli [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=911.12s)]
*  Prime Minister, leading to this special address to the nation tonight. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=917.28s)]
*  Nicole, thank you for that special address to the nation from Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=921.84s)]
*  where he said the war is going to go on. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=925.92s)]
*  Nicole Johnson there, interesting. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9v-GL0edQ&t=928.56s)]
