# Lammy avoids Israel genocide question
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k)
*  Amnesty, a UN special report of the Human Rights Group, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=0.0s)]
*  are now accusing Israel of a genocide in Gaza. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=4.24s)]
*  Is that happening, do you think? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=7.04s)]
*  And how important is it to stop that, if that's the case? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=8.08s)]
*  We've been very clear that the scenes of children dying, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=11.52s)]
*  the horrors of people not being able to get aid, is unacceptable. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=18.56s)]
*  It's horrendous. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=23.44s)]
*  I said this last week in the House of Commons. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  We've made a number of decisions, including stopping arms sales that could be used in Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=27.12s)]
*  And for all of those reasons, it's important that we now see a ceasefire. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=34.88s)]
*  Is it a genocide, though, do you think? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=40.24s)]
*  I was clear back in September that we did believe that there was a clear risk [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=42.24s)]
*  of a breach of international humanitarian law. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=47.6s)]
*  That's the law as it exists in the UK. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=50.32s)]
*  For that reason, I suspended arms sales that could be used in Gaza. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=52.8s)]
*  Many of us can see what is happening in Gaza. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=58.48s)]
*  It is now important that the international courts do their work in terms of future determinations. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=61.44s)]
*  A severe risk, but if we cross that point now, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=68.08s)]
*  do you think they are now committing something more egregious? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=70.08s)]
*  We have always been clear that that is a decision for international courts. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=72.08s)]
*  Of course, individuals can make their own judgments and assessments, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=75.92s)]
*  but I, as UK Foreign Secretary, have to stand by our law. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=79.04s)]
*  And I determined many, many months ago that there was a clear risk of a breach of international humanitarian law. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU4W37Egj3k&t=83.68s)]
