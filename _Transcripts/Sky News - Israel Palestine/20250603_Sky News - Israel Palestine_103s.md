# 'Why aren't journalists allowed into Gaza?'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M)
*  I'm putting the questions to you and as you well know in recent weeks we have spoken to Hamas about this this 27 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=0.0s)]
*  That were killed three children were killed two women were they a threat as well [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=4.92s)]
*  Again every bit of news which comes out of Hamas of Gaza is controlled by the terrorist organization [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=9.8s)]
*  There have been many I can read you can't be trusted. We're saying no [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=16.28s)]
*  I'm not I'm saying that you need to verify do your jobs. We love to David. We are not preventing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=19.44s)]
*  No David you and I spoken about before we would love to verify this [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=25.2s)]
*  But international journalists are not allowed into Gaza are they why not? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=29.16s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you very very clearly what what the reason is for that our priority is getting our hostages out [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=33.8s)]
*  Yes skies journalists in that's our priority. That's what we care about now real journalists enter Gaza with the IDF [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=40.44s)]
*  Hamas journalists unfortunately never leave because they work with [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Hamas and to be fair to those journalists reporting from Gaza [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=52.76s)]
*  You won't be alive very long if you ever do produce any sort of output that is against Hamas [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=55.72s)]
*  Because Hamas will kill you so many so-called journalists in Gaza and of course [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=62.24s)]
*  We regret any journalists which have been killed real journalists, but you know Hamas operatives [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=66.64s)]
*  You're distinguishing between real journalists and and fake gents that the point is David [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=71.92s)]
*  Journalists aren't allowed from international organizations are not allowed into Gaza are they and I'm asking you again [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=76.28s)]
*  Why you don't allow them? Why don't the Israeli government allow? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=80.78s)]
*  Journalists in you'll know the charge that's put to the Israeli government is that they don't want the world to see what's really happening [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=84.3s)]
*  Again, so there's no shortage of output from Gaza. It's been on our front of our screens for 20 months now [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=90.1s)]
*  But our priority is getting our hostages out [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=95.88s)]
*  You're not letting get our live hostages out not sending your journalists in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMShn8RZU8M&t=98.26s)]
