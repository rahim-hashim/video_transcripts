# Day three of Trump's Middle East tour
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws)
*  Donald Trump in the Middle East, day three, this is what you need to know. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=0.0s)]
*  The welcome here has been as lavish as it was in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=3.36s)]
*  We saw air shows, we saw Arabian horses flanking the beast as he arrived at Lussel Palace here [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=7.4s)]
*  in Doha to meet with the Emir. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=14.24s)]
*  He met hundreds of dignitaries, including top business leaders from both Qatar and the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=16.72s)]
*  United States. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=22.52s)]
*  Obviously, Donald Trump has been loving every minute of this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=23.52s)]
*  And alongside that, big deals, big investments, trillions of dollars has been promised to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=27.58s)]
*  the United States. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  But geopolitics has also been at the center of his trip here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=34.22s)]
*  We saw in Riyadh where he met with the Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Sharah, big developments [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=38.42s)]
*  there, historic meeting. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=44.46s)]
*  And then, of course, here in Doha, he's talked about progress with the Iran nuclear deal [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=46.3s)]
*  and that he hopes that will get over the line. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  We want to see Iran do well, thrive and be successful and everybody be happy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=53.78s)]
*  I know many Iranians. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=58.7s)]
*  I know many Iranians living in New York and Washington, D.C. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=60.54s)]
*  They're great people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=64.42s)]
*  But there are big questions being asked about the situation with Ukraine and Russia. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=65.9s)]
*  Vladimir Putin says he won't be going to Turkey. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=71.06s)]
*  Donald Trump now says he won't be going to Turkey. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=73.7s)]
*  So we'll have to wait and see how that develops. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=76.62s)]
*  And of course, the situation with Gaza. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  The bloodshed there has somewhat overshadowed his trip here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=82.54s)]
*  We've seen dozens of children killed. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=86.82000000000001s)]
*  So it'll be interesting to know what conversations were had behind the scenes with Donald Trump [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=89.34s)]
*  to bring that to his attention. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdee9Mjrws&t=94.66000000000001s)]
