Video Description: The first trucks carrying humanitarian aid have been allowed into Gaza following a nearly three month blockade of food, medicine and other supplies, Israel and the UN have said.

United Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher said Israel cleared nine trucks of aid on Monday to enter Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing but added it is "drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed".

# First aid trucks enter Gaza since early March - as UN says it is 'drop in the ocean'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls)
*  Welcome back. Let's focus now on the threat to Israel from three world leaders. The UK, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=0.0s)]
*  France and Canada have condemned Israel's renewed military offensive and the blocking [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=5.44s)]
*  of aid in Gaza. They've threatened targeted sanctions if Tel Aviv does not change course. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=9.8s)]
*  There was some progress today. The Israeli military says five aid trucks entered the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=15.88s)]
*  strip after a three-month blockade, but that, say international charities, is only a drop [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=19.84s)]
*  in the ocean. And a warning that this report from our Middle East correspondent, Alistair [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Bonkall, contains images which you may find distressing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=29.04s)]
*  Israeli special forces went into Khan Unas this morning under the cover of heavy shelling [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=43.04s)]
*  and airstrikes. The IDF said that the target was a Palestinian militant. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=48.32s)]
*  But as always, civilians were among the dead and wounded. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=60.04s)]
*  Some of them were brought to the city's hospital on the back of a flatbed truck. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  Wake up, wake up, she's screaming. The body is her daughter, Aline. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=89.04s)]
*  This storage facility at the hospital was hit, destroying medicine. The hospital's director said [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=106.04s)]
*  that most of the supplies were for dialysis patients. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=112.04s)]
*  They claim they targeted a police headquarters. That place used to be a civilian police station [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=120.04s)]
*  before the war. Now it's just a storage area, what's left of the medical supplies from NASA [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=125.04s)]
*  hospital. This is the result behind me. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  The Israeli military says its ground operation in Gaza is only just getting underway. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  They released these images of troops and tanks moving through Gaza. They've warned there [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  is more to come. After an 11-week siege, Israel says it will now allow what it describes as [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=148.04s)]
*  basic levels of aid into Gaza. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=156.04s)]
*  We've been receiving reports that there is about 20 or 30 trucks or even less that are planned [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=159.04s)]
*  to come in. These are not confirmed reports, but the needs in Gaza are much, much higher than that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=167.04s)]
*  So we do hope that it's much more than just 20 or 30 because that's going to be a drop in the ocean [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=174.04s)]
*  amid this sea of needs. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=180.04s)]
*  Israel's finance minister today said that Gaza will be wiped out and suggested the entire [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=185.04s)]
*  population will be permanently removed. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=191.04s)]
*  The population will reach the south of the Strait and from there, with God's help, move to third [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=196.04s)]
*  countries under President Trump's plan. This is a change in the course of history, nothing less. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=201.04s)]
*  The IDF has now declared the whole of Karn Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, a combat zone, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=209.04s)]
*  forcing tens of thousands to flee. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=215.04s)]
*  Um Hussein has been walking through the night and the heat of the day. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=221.04s)]
*  I've been walking since 1 a.m. I'm heading towards the beach area. I'm helping my son. He's gone to get his wife [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=226.04s)]
*  and family now. He has five kids. We'll be together when he comes back. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=232.04s)]
*  With Israel's repeated threats to occupy Gaza, this now feels like an exodus, a slow, reluctant march to an [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=237.04s)]
*  unknown future as the war again closes in around them. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAvVnhaggls&t=245.04s)]
