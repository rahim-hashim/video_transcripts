# ‘No starvation in Gaza’
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_fqOxACVys)
*  The only starvation in Gaza is the starvation of the hostages. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_fqOxACVys&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the only starvation in Gaza today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_fqOxACVys&t=3.64s)]
*  So you're denying that there are hungry children, babies dying. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_fqOxACVys&t=5.64s)]
*  These are the accounts of British, American doctors, Israeli human rights groups, people [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_fqOxACVys&t=9.88s)]
*  who are in touch. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_fqOxACVys&t=15.64s)]
*  Multiple times I've interviewed people on the ground working there. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_fqOxACVys&t=17.56s)]
*  So you're denying the accounts of hundreds of doctors. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_fqOxACVys&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  I listened to Mr. Tom Fletcher from the UN claiming that 14,000 Palestinian babies will [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_fqOxACVys&t=24.92s)]
*  die within 48 hours. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_fqOxACVys&t=31.64s)]
*  Then he had to retract his words and apologize and acknowledge that it was not true. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_fqOxACVys&t=33.32s)]
*  Aid is coming into Gaza today through two mechanisms, through trucks and through the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_fqOxACVys&t=38.84s)]
*  USNU initiative, which distributed 2 million meals in the last few days. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_fqOxACVys&t=43.56s)]
