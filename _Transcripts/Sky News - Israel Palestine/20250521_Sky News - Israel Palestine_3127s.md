# All of Gaza will come under Israeli control, PM Benjamin Netanyahu says in news conference
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0)
*  Good evening, citizens of Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=0.0s)]
*  On behalf of all of you, I would like to begin by greeting the guests from the bottom of my [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=13.68s)]
*  heart and yours, the families of Samal Yosef, Yehuda Chirak and, first of all, Danil Yosef, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=20.92s)]
*  the family of the late Yitzhak Yilomukano, may his memory be blessed, who fell in the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=29.92s)]
*  hands of Gaza. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=36.92s)]
*  The war of independence is a heavy price for us, but it has a justified and clear decision [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=37.92s)]
*  from the UN, to impose the Hamas, which executed the seven tribes in October, to return all [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=41.92s)]
*  our lands and to make sure that Gaza will not be a threat to Israel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=49.92s)]
*  These lands are full of them, and we are committed to achieving them until the end. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=55.92s)]

*  We started in Gaza, we have killed tens of thousands of terrorists, we have killed many [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=73.92s)]
*  of our own people. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=81.92s)]
*  We have killed many of our own people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=84.92s)]

*  We have killed many of our own people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=120.92s)]
*  We have killed many of our own people. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=123.92s)]
*  We have killed many of our own people. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=126.92s)]
*  We have killed many of our own people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  We have killed many of our own people. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=133.92s)]

*  We have killed many of our own people. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=139.92s)]
*  We have killed many of our own people. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=143.92s)]
*  And this way, there would be an opportunity of temporary ceasefire, and I would like to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=146.92s)]
*  reiterate, temporary ceasefire. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=157.92s)]
*  We're ready for it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=160.92s)]
*  After we destroyed the enemy in the south and stood from huge pressure, national one and from home, we threw these pressures. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=163.28s)]
*  We came into Rafa, we came to the Philadelphia. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=180.76s)]
*  We destroyed the Hamas tunnel. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=184.11999999999998s)]
*  Only then we went north. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=187.55999999999997s)]
*  And we did a deeper mission, which was unparalleled. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  And we eliminated thousands of terrorists from Kizballah and the senior of Kizballah. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=201.72s)]
*  Most of the rockets that they built within years and therefore eliminated the threat towards our settlements in the north. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=214.6s)]
*  It's not like it used to be. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=233.16s)]
*  We're enforcing it very strongly. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=237.48s)]
*  Our operations in Lebanon brought to the falling of Assad regime in Syria. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=244.6s)]
*  We brought huge attacks on the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=253.64s)]
*  And as I said the last time, we hurt Iran's abilities and crucial infrastructure. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=258.2s)]
*  And I'd like to say Iran remained a serious threat to Israel. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=266.28s)]
*  Of course, according with the US coordinating with them all the time, we hope that an agreement will [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  between that Iran will not have nuclear power and if it's achieved, we will of course congratulate that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  But in any case, the state of Israel saved the right to defend the war from a regime who want to eliminate it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=301.56s)]
*  We have not yet finished the job with Iran. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  This operation would have been best done to do just that, complete the war. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=321.0s)]
*  Three days ago, the defense minister, he authorized the next phase of the war. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=326.12s)]
*  Our forces have brought huge attacks on the enemy. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=337.08s)]
*  Ask the Gaza envelope residents. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=349.24s)]
*  Their houses are shaking not from Hamas, but because what the IDF is doing, our forces [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=355.64s)]
*  are catching more and more territories to eliminate and clear out Hamas terrorists. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=364.68s)]
*  All of the Gaza Strip will be under the security control of Israel. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=371.88s)]
*  In order to allow freedom of movement and for our dear friends, continue to support us. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=382.2s)]
*  We need to prevent humanitarian aid. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=391.32s)]
*  Friends from the American Senate, dear friends, are telling me, we will give you all our backup. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=394.52000000000004s)]
*  We will send weapons and in the UN, kill those monsters. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  But one thing we cannot accept, we cannot accept the humanitarian situation in Gaza. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=410.76000000000005s)]
*  Hamas is looting most of the humanitarian aid and the rest is selling [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=420.68s)]
*  which profits in order to fund terrorist activity. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=431.47999999999996s)]
*  We are killing the terrorists and they are recruiting more by the money they get from the humanitarian aid. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=436.91999999999996s)]
*  In order to eliminate that, we developed another plan of basic that will not reach. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=446.2s)]
*  First phase, entering basic food to Gaza in order to allow the continuation of the war. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=465.88s)]
*  American companies will hand out food in certain points by the IDF. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  Third phase, create a sterile zone to which the Sicilian population will be referred. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=491.0s)]
*  And they will get all the humanitarian aid. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  When somebody tells us, okay, finish the war already, then I have news for them. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=513.56s)]
*  I am ready to finish. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=518.28s)]
*  Clear conditions that will secure the security of Israel. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=521.3199999999999s)]
*  All of our hostages home, Hamas is no longer in power, give up weapons. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=526.04s)]
*  Gaza will no longer be a threat with weapons and we are operating according to Trump's vision. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=531.32s)]
*  Very clear and accurate. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=543.72s)]
*  Gaza people who would like to go out will be able to do so. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=545.72s)]
*  Everyone who calls us to end the war, before those targets are achieved, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=549.72s)]
*  our achievements. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=556.76s)]
*  Means that if Hamas is still in power, all our children and the sacrifice of our heroes, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=560.76s)]
*  warriors, if Hamas is recovered, and industry of profit will be recovered, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=566.68s)]
*  we will again be within reach of our citizens. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=575.88s)]
*  And more and more. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=581.72s)]
*  Killings and more rape. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=586.92s)]
*  I am not willing to accept that. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  And the citizens, neither are you. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=590.92s)]
*  I heard the shocking thing that Yair Golan said. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=596.4399999999999s)]
*  Like most of you, I've been appalled. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=602.2s)]
*  While our heroes, our soldiers, they are risking their lives in defending our country. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=605.72s)]
*  Yair Golan is accusing them in war crimes, saying that we are killing babies. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=614.2800000000001s)]
*  He said we are killing babies as a hobby. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=620.6s)]
*  I've heard that only from the worst of anti-Semites, it reminds me of the bloodbath. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=626.2800000000001s)]
*  From the Middle Ages. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=634.84s)]
*  Those who have followed the killing babies with monstrous attention is Hamas. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=639.4s)]
*  Our army is doing everything in its power, not killing babies. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=648.76s)]
*  There is no more moral army than the Israeli army. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=654.0400000000001s)]
*  There is no limit to him losing his way, jealousy, pride, making a man to lose his mind. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=665.32s)]
*  And I tell you why they do that. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=680.36s)]
*  They do it because for them, everything is a limit. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=682.2800000000001s)]
*  In order to destroy the Israeli government, they are willing to do everything. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=687.64s)]
*  Everything. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=692.6800000000001s)]
*  Telling lies about Israel and the IDF and its soldiers. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=695.5600000000001s)]
*  And they are willing for us to lose the war. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=700.76s)]
*  So I'm happy that the vast majority of the citizens of Israel reject these things. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=705.1600000000001s)]
*  It does not make our spirit weaker than this spirit of our warriors. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=715.48s)]
*  I'm meeting them on the ground. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=723.24s)]
*  The soldiers, the bereaved family that I meet, all of them say we do not stop. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=726.0400000000001s)]
*  Go all the way until completely killing. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=734.2800000000001s)]
*  And this is what I'm telling you, the citizens of Israel tonight. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=737.72s)]
*  We are here together until the end. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=740.76s)]
*  Until we die. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=743.64s)]
*  We will together fight. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=746.04s)]
*  With the help of God, we will prevail and win. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=749.0s)]
*  We are seeing another high court decision regarding the head of Shin Bet. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=770.76s)]
*  When will the moment arrive that you will say this is an unlawful decision, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=788.28s)]
*  we are not complying with the high court decision? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=794.76s)]
*  I'd like to read the law referring to the decision to appoint the head of the Shin Bet. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=799.24s)]
*  We will be appointed by the government according to the prime minister's suggestion. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=811.96s)]
*  The government allowed to stop the head of the Shin Bet activities. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=819.4s)]
*  And it's clear and sharp. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=827.08s)]
*  The high court sometimes needs to comment on the law and clarify it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=831.88s)]
*  Everyone acts according to law. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=838.84s)]
*  Me, you, citizens of Israel, need to abide by the law. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=841.32s)]
*  Also the attorney general. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=847.24s)]
*  The law is not a privilege. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=849.96s)]
*  The law oblige everyone. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=852.6800000000001s)]
*  And whether to break the law is breaking the law. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=862.2800000000001s)]
*  So to me, there is a simple question. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=866.36s)]
*  Whether the high court and the general attorney will protect the law. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=871.8000000000001s)]
*  The law is divided when the public is choosing who to elect. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=882.76s)]
*  Now you need to decide whether to respect the law or not. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=893.8000000000001s)]
*  If the law hurting democracy and the security of Israel [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=900.36s)]
*  and does not allow us to appoint a new head of Shin Bet, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=905.0s)]
*  after this high court decision, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=911.7199999999999s)]
*  then afterwards I get a letter from the attorney general telling me, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=921.3199999999999s)]
*  you cannot appoint the head of Shin Bet because I have a conflict of interest. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=929.1600000000001s)]
*  She does, not me. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=938.12s)]
*  She has multiple conflicts of interest. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=940.76s)]
*  It's like the camel doesn't see its back. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=945.8000000000001s)]
*  In my trial, it appeared that the witness of the persecution is very close to the attorney general [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=948.12s)]
*  and she didn't bother to update on that. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=962.52s)]
*  If it was me, it would be another trial. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=969.64s)]
*  And there's another thing. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=973.3199999999999s)]
*  She is very close. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=974.76s)]
*  She is the attorney general, she is very close to the head of the Shin Bet. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=979.0799999999999s)]
*  Tomorrow she will need to give an answer about this conflict of interest. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=985.72s)]
*  And today she is letting me know that I have a conflict of interest. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=991.64s)]
*  Because we are at a war, a very difficult war, with Hamas. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=997.08s)]
*  And they, the High Court of Justice, is in a war with the government of Israel [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1007.4s)]
*  and they are hurting the security of the state by not allowing to appoint a new head of Shin Bet. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1014.6800000000001s)]
*  They make up the rules. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1021.16s)]
*  More than 70 years there are no rules about this. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1026.52s)]
*  Now they are making these rules up. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1030.28s)]
*  It's all a charade. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1034.6s)]
*  And now I'd like to tell you, this is the question that I'd like to answer her with. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1037.8s)]
*  The government, when I'm heading the government, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1044.28s)]
*  we will appoint a head of Shin Bet. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1049.16s)]
*  And we will do it because it's essential to our security. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1052.28s)]
*  An hour and a half ago, a year and a half ago, you promised me victory. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1060.2s)]
*  Is it a failure for you that this victory has not been? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1065.48s)]
*  There were many victories. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1070.68s)]
*  I'd like to say, I said on the second day, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1073.48s)]
*  you said we will change the fate of the Middle East. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1077.16s)]
*  And we did. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1080.76s)]
*  Talking about what happened in the South, where people are turning to their home, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1083.16s)]
*  there are no rockets. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1090.52s)]
*  Look what we achieved in the middle. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1094.68s)]
*  We brought Hezbollah on its knees. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1097.0s)]
*  Because of our operation, Assad regime failed. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1099.0s)]
*  We are acting against Iran. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1106.6s)]
*  We can eliminate the act. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1108.6s)]
*  We still have a job to do. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1110.6s)]
*  Why is the war in Gaza taking so long? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1112.6s)]
*  You know why? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1115.4s)]
*  Because no other military in the world have met such an early arena. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1116.6s)]
*  The population who support them. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1123.8799999999999s)]
*  This is a new situation. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1125.8s)]
*  Nothing like it, not in Fallujah and nowhere else. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1129.8s)]
*  And the second thing is the whole. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1133.8s)]
*  This is new and another thing. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1135.8s)]
*  International pressure is on the side of the world. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1139.8s)]
*  And we have to do something about it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1143.8s)]
*  And we have to do something about it. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1145.8s)]
*  And we have to do something about it. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1147.8s)]
*  And we have to do something about it. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1149.8s)]
*  International pressure, embargo. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1151.8s)]
*  It's not something to take for granted. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1155.8s)]
*  All these things are delaying. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1159.8s)]
*  We do not like to end the war, but we will do it one step at a time. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1161.8s)]
*  And this is a critical phase. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1169.8s)]
*  We like to finish the three tasks. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1173.8s)]
*  Eliminate Hamas. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1177.8s)]
*  Release of all our hostages. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1179.8s)]
*  And for Gaza to enter a new path. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1181.8s)]
*  We would like to achieve with minimum lives lost for our soldiers. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1189.8s)]
*  I don't like to disclose our plans. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1201.8s)]
*  But we are determined to destroy Hamas. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1205.8s)]
*  Bring all our hostages back. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1209.8s)]
*  And bring a new future to Gaza. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1211.8s)]
*  Otherwise it will happen over and over again. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1213.8s)]
*  On behalf of enough Tzanga'uke. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1223.8s)]
*  Are you aware of Matan's situation? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1227.8s)]
*  Medical state. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1231.8s)]
*  We won't be dying in captivity. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1233.8s)]
*  We will not have the same fate. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1243.8s)]
*  Like 41 hostages who have been killed during the war. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1245.8s)]
*  I met Inab. I spoke with her. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1253.8s)]
*  Of course I know. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1255.8s)]
*  And I'm surprised because she knows I know about her son's condition. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1257.8s)]
*  Fake news that I've heard that I refuse to accept reports about the hostages medical condition. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1267.8s)]
*  I do not refuse to get them all the time. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1275.8s)]
*  By the department who are taking care of that. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1283.8s)]
*  I have a detailed record for each and every one. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1285.8s)]
*  And we are certainly act. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1291.8s)]
*  And I cannot detail. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1295.8s)]
*  We are acting not to hurt them. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1297.8s)]
*  And to answer the question many of you are asking. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1301.8s)]
*  How do we complete destruction of Hamas and bring back the hostages? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1305.8s)]
*  There are many ways. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1313.8s)]
*  But I will not detail them. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1315.8s)]
*  Those efforts are combined. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1319.8s)]
*  We cannot bring them back without the military pressure and the political pressure. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1321.8s)]
*  The maneuvers. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1331.8s)]
*  All of these allow us to bring them back. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1333.8s)]
*  The task is important. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1343.8s)]
*  You said in December that we will bring full victory. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1361.8s)]
*  You said that victory is within reach. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1369.8s)]
*  Very close reach. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1375.8s)]
*  You said that we are on the verge of great victory. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1381.8s)]
*  I want to ask. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1385.8s)]
*  Till when will you say as a 2023? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1387.8s)]
*  Well, we are on the verge of victory. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1393.8s)]
*  I have not defined minutes and hours. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1397.8s)]
*  A state with seven fronts. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1401.8s)]
*  No other country, not even Britain and the allies. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1405.8s)]
*  They didn't have seven fronts. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1411.8s)]
*  We have Iran. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1413.8s)]
*  We turn things upside down within a year and a half. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1417.8s)]
*  Everybody is aware of the fact that Israel is a huge power. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1427.8s)]
*  And the strongest is that this is a significant change in a historical time. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1433.8s)]
*  We still have to do. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1441.8s)]
*  We have the victories, but we still need to do several things. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1445.8s)]
*  We will have the necessary time. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1451.8s)]
*  With a timeline that I'm not ready to disclose. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1455.8s)]
*  For Hamas. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1459.8s)]
*  People who are doing the reserve. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1463.8s)]
*  I admire them. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1467.8s)]
*  I need their families. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1469.8s)]
*  With their wives. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1471.8s)]
*  And I see tremendous things. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1473.8s)]
*  I see the spirit of fighting and sacrifice. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1477.8s)]
*  And the price that they pay. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1481.8s)]
*  We would like to help them. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1483.8s)]
*  So the government decided to get three and a half billion more shekels. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1487.8s)]
*  Kindergarten for schools. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1497.8s)]
*  For helping homes. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1501.8s)]
*  Goes to a lot of things. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1505.8s)]
*  Many things I can tell. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1507.8s)]
*  But there is one clue. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1511.8s)]
*  You can go on the internet. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1513.8s)]
*  You give your details. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1515.8s)]
*  All of the rights. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1517.8s)]
*  That you are entitled to. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1519.8s)]
*  So when you go on the internet you will discover this. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1521.8s)]
*  This in addition to the pay in shekels. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1525.8s)]
*  So 20 billion total. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1529.8s)]
*  Was never before. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1531.8s)]
*  They deserve more. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1533.8s)]
*  We are giving them. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1535.8s)]
*  And I'd like for them to buy land. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1539.8s)]
*  So we're giving them land. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1545.8s)]
*  Not in high prices. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1547.8s)]
*  They are serving us. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1549.8s)]
*  So that will also be the case. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1551.8s)]
*  We will do everything we can to help them. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1553.8s)]
*  They are serving us. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1557.8s)]
*  So that will also be the case. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1559.8s)]
*  We will do everything for them. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1561.8s)]
*  Because they do everything for us. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1563.8s)]
*  Your most close allies are suspected. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1565.8s)]
*  In the Qatar gate. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1587.8s)]
*  Bringing Qatar to your office. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1591.8s)]
*  Do you not think that morally. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1595.8s)]
*  You should have disclosed this. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1603.8s)]
*  That two of your men are getting paid by Qatar. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1605.8s)]
*  What are you going to do about it? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1609.8s)]
*  I did not know. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1611.8s)]
*  And even today I don't know everything. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1613.8s)]
*  They said about me. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1617.8s)]
*  That I got. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1621.8s)]
*  A huge. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1625.8s)]
*  Abuse. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1627.8s)]
*  From Qatar. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1629.8s)]
*  I didn't get anything. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1631.8s)]
*  And I will do anyone who will sell. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1633.8s)]
*  The second. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1635.8s)]
*  I attacked Qatar. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1639.8s)]
*  And they attacked me. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1641.8s)]
*  I am the only one. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1645.8s)]
*  People who dealt with Qatar. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1649.8s)]
*  They praised Qatar. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1653.8s)]
*  And I attacked them. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1657.8s)]
*  Not only in the cabinet. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1659.8s)]
*  I attacked Qatar in the media. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1661.8s)]
*  In the media. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1665.8s)]
*  And I told my media. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1667.8s)]
*  Including Jonathan. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1671.8s)]
*  That. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1673.8s)]
*  It's all good. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1677.8s)]
*  And I said yes we are trying to get. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1679.8s)]
*  The aid. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1683.8s)]
*  And the system with. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1685.8s)]
*  Forget they are hosting. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1687.8s)]
*  The hummus. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1689.8s)]
*  They are supporting from us. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1691.8s)]
*  They do. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1697.8s)]
*  I attacked them and they attacked me back. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1699.8s)]
*  And I said. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1701.8s)]
*  This is a lie. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1703.8s)]
*  Fake. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1705.8s)]
*  Another fake is that I have conflict of interest. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1711.8s)]
*  About forging documents. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1717.8s)]
*  That need to be checked. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1719.8s)]
*  That is not to be a lie. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1721.8s)]
*  And this is a lie too. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1727.8s)]
*  I heard about what the judge said about Jonathan. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1729.8s)]
*  I don't see anything unlawful. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1735.8s)]
*  Why is he under house arrest? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1739.8s)]
*  There is nothing. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1741.8s)]
*  There is no danger to the state. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1743.8s)]
*  To the security. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1747.8s)]
*  No threat to the security of Israel. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1749.8s)]
*  I like to say. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1753.8s)]
*  It will be. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1755.8s)]
*  It will turn out to be fake. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1757.8s)]
*  I don't need to say. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1759.8s)]
*  About something that is not right. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1761.8s)]
*  But it's true because it doesn't exist. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1765.8s)]
*  I didn't even get a skin from the tar. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1773.8s)]
*  I know one thing. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1783.8s)]
*  You don't talk with this propaganda. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1785.8s)]
*  Even if you didn't get money personally. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1795.8s)]
*  You transferred money to Hamas. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1797.8s)]
*  So I like to be accurate. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1803.8s)]
*  The money that was transferred to Hamas. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1805.8s)]
*  The money that was transferred with the recommendation. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1809.8s)]
*  With the small of the whole money Hamas got. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1813.8s)]
*  From Iran. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1821.8s)]
*  From international. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1823.8s)]
*  From the EU. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1825.8s)]
*  And other sources. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1827.8s)]
*  And what was the money used for? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1829.8s)]
*  For one thousand groceries. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1833.8s)]
*  And the money was used for... [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1837.8s)]
*  I like to ask another question. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1841.8s)]
*  Why are you saying that? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1843.8s)]
*  You are saying that. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1845.8s)]
*  You like to imply that this money went to the state of October. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1847.8s)]
*  This is what you want to say. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1853.8s)]
*  So I ask you. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1855.8s)]
*  What were we attacked with? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1857.8s)]
*  Planes? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1861.8s)]
*  F-35s? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1863.8s)]
*  They attacked us with flip-flops. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1865.8s)]
*  Kalashnikovs. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1871.8s)]
*  And it cost nothing. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1873.8s)]
*  How did it happen? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1877.8s)]
*  Another question. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1881.8s)]
*  That they build tunnels, yes? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1883.8s)]
*  With the money they build tunnels. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1885.8s)]
*  But no tunnel penetrated the state of Israel. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1893.8s)]
*  Not before and not since the 7th of October. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1901.8s)]
*  Why? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1903.8s)]
*  Because I as a prime minister insisted on a wall. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1905.8s)]
*  An underground wall. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1909.8s)]
*  Which blocked the tunnel. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1911.8s)]
*  So they did not penetrate underground. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1913.8s)]
*  Only underground. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1917.8s)]
*  That cost nothing. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1921.8s)]
*  So what brought the 7th of October was not the Qatari money. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1923.8s)]
*  This is a huge lie. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1925.8s)]
*  What brought the 7th of October was a chain of failures that need to be checked. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1929.8s)]
*  And I insist that it will be checked until the end. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1935.8s)]
*  And everyone will take responsibility by an objective committee. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1941.8s)]
*  Unbiased. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1947.8s)]
*  I'd like to ask, how did it happen? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1949.8s)]
*  How did it happen that no one was near the fence? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1951.8s)]
*  That there was an order not to be designed next to the fence? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1957.8s)]
*  How did the Air Force get the instructions to act hours after the operation began? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1963.8s)]
*  Who told them to do that and not to do that? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1971.8s)]
*  There was a settlement who did not do that directly. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1975.8s)]
*  And you know what happened? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1981.8s)]
*  They didn't eliminate terrorists because they didn't penetrate that settlement. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1985.8s)]
*  So the estimation of the failure, I'd like them to check everything. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1995.8s)]
*  We will check that. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=1999.8s)]
*  We will be examined. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2003.8s)]
*  There is so much fake news and spins. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2005.8s)]
*  Qatar is not a friendly country. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2011.8s)]
*  It transferred the money. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2015.8s)]
*  They maintain whatever they maintain. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2017.8s)]
*  The failure of the 7th of October must be checked. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2021.8s)]
*  What exactly caused this? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2025.8s)]
*  Different failures. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2027.8s)]
*  Qatar, in any case, there is a deal in the Knesset. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2029.8s)]
*  And I do that. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2037.8s)]
*  After they finished helping us with the hostages. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2041.8s)]
*  By supplying Qatar as an enemy state, they operated on Syria. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2047.8s)]
*  And in the US... [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2054.8s)]
*  Maybe it's time to say... [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2062.8s)]
*  Also to our American friends. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2065.8s)]
*  And the bill will be promoted. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2068.8s)]
*  But regardless of freeing the hostages. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2078.8s)]
*  It's not included. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2084.8s)]
*  The people's staff, since your last press conference. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2086.8s)]
*  Your sensibility. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2092.8s)]
*  Only the Prime Minister stayed in his position. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2096.8s)]
*  Is it not the case that you should resign as well? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2100.8s)]
*  And bring back the decision to the public? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2108.8s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2110.8s)]
*  And we must. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2112.8s)]
*  What did you do before? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2114.8s)]
*  Let's understand the public. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2118.8s)]
*  It's a horrific disaster. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2122.8s)]
*  I will give the answer. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2124.8s)]
*  Every day I'm standing in front of the public. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2126.8s)]
*  And I'm not going to be able to do anything. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2132.8s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do anything. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2136.8s)]
*  I'm standing in front of the public. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2138.8s)]
*  And when the public is pressing for its loyalty, it will happen. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2142.8s)]
*  Do you like to have elections now? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2150.8s)]
*  In the middle of the war? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2152.8s)]
*  Now? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2154.8s)]
*  Do you like me to detail what we're standing against? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2156.8s)]
*  Do you like to have a committee to investigate? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2160.8s)]
*  Now? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2164.8s)]
*  All of our commanders with their lawyers? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2166.8s)]
*  What if the press conference does not end? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2174.8s)]
*  Sorry, this is not a one-on-one interview. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2176.8s)]
*  Channel 12, frightening. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2182.8s)]
*  Bringing panelists. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2186.8s)]
*  There is one person who is very bitter. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2192.8s)]
*  All those experts, they bring them to the studio. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2196.8s)]
*  They're talking with themselves. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2200.8s)]
*  They're not letting anybody else give answers. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2204.8s)]
*  We've asked questions and I've answered them. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2208.8s)]
*  The finance minister is saying no humanitarian aid will enter Gaza. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2218.8s)]
*  But we see that the trucks are going to Gaza. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2226.8s)]
*  How can we make sure it will not reach Hamas? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2230.8s)]
*  And will you stop the trucks if it reaches Hamas? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2232.8s)]
*  I said in the beginning, in the first place, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2236.8s)]
*  we will have control over the trucks. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2240.8s)]
*  100 trucks. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2246.8s)]
*  And 10% of them were seized by Hamas. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2250.8s)]
*  Of course we will do everything in our power to allow this. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2254.8s)]
*  In the second phase, we will have the means of handing out food. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2258.8s)]
*  And it's a personal hand out to the family, not a truck. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2264.8s)]
*  It stops for a week. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2272.8s)]
*  And the third phase, we are talking about the sterile zone, cleared from Hamas. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2274.8s)]
*  And it's a free zone where there's no limitation of giving humanitarian aid. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2284.8s)]
*  The Hamas cannot enter. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2290.8s)]
*  Very important plan. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2294.8s)]
*  We are coming to destroy military abilities of Hamas. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2298.8s)]
*  And their ability to rule. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2302.8s)]
*  And they are able to rule Gaza because they can loot. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2308.8s)]
*  And once we are legal, we will see. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2312.8s)]
*  And I estimate that we will see the results. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2316.8s)]
*  We already see. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2320.8s)]
*  Have you seen the videos of the Gazans? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2322.8s)]
*  One of them is saying, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2328.8s)]
*  Me, D. Netanyahu, save us from Hamas. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2330.8s)]
*  They have generation. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2332.8s)]
*  And the Gazans are saying, don't enter our home. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2334.8s)]
*  Because Israel will operate against our home. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2338.8s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2342.8s)]
*  It wasn't like that in the beginning of the war. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2344.8s)]
*  And we see that now. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2346.8s)]
*  And it's a challenge, but also an opportunity to complete the job. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2348.8s)]
*  I cannot promise you it will be perfect. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2352.8s)]
*  But we will do anything within our power so they will not rule. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2354.8s)]
*  How humanitarian aid? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2362.8s)]
*  We are in a risk crisis against the EU. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2366.8s)]
*  Who are threatening us with sanctions. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2376.8s)]
*  They are attacking not only the humanitarian situation now. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2378.8s)]
*  But also the plan that you just mentioned. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2384.8s)]
*  That it's non-practical. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2390.8s)]
*  They are calling it a way of disaster. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2394.8s)]
*  And you say that we will have sanctions against it. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2400.8s)]
*  And we are ready for it. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2406.8s)]
*  But we won't get back to entering the humanitarian aid like the Europeans. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2408.8s)]
*  Even with it. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2416.8s)]
*  We will do whatever it takes to complete the war. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2418.8s)]
*  The interesting sanctions is elsewhere. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2422.8s)]
*  The UN Security Council. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2424.8s)]
*  And we will not allow this. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2428.8s)]
*  This is what Hamas wants. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2432.8s)]
*  It wants to end the war. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2434.8s)]
*  Bring about a decision of the UN Security Council. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2436.8s)]
*  To oblige 180 states. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2442.8s)]
*  And if you try to change it. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2446.8s)]
*  China will veto it. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2448.8s)]
*  So we are not getting this condition. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2452.8s)]
*  They don't know what they are talking about. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2458.8s)]
*  People who say we will finish the war with Hamas conditions. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2460.8s)]
*  Bring back the decision. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2464.8s)]
*  Then we will be back. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2466.8s)]
*  But safe yet. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2468.8s)]
*  We will have to clear the whole glass of spirit. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2470.8s)]
*  Get the decision that will paralyze the Israeli economy. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2474.8s)]
*  And its security system. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2478.8s)]
*  Madness. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2482.8s)]
*  The answer is we will do whatever it takes to complete the war. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2484.8s)]
*  And regarding the European countries. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2486.8s)]
*  These are the same countries that said to finish the war. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2490.8s)]
*  Don't go into Lebanon. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2494.8s)]
*  Don't go into Raqqa. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2496.8s)]
*  They all said the same. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2498.8s)]
*  And we did not hear them. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2500.8s)]
*  And we had sanctions from our biggest ally. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2504.8s)]
*  The US. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2506.8s)]
*  And from people. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2508.8s)]
*  I think it's a horrible thing. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2510.8s)]
*  And I appreciate that Trump cancelled those sanctions against our supporters. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2512.8s)]
*  And that we have to take the responsibility. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2518.8s)]
*  Instead of sanctioning Hamas. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2522.8s)]
*  They are sanctioning us. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2526.8s)]
*  Those countries are under pressure. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2530.8s)]
*  By the Islamic minority. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2536.8s)]
*  And public opinion. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2540.8s)]
*  Something. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2542.8s)]
*  Fake propaganda of Hamas. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2544.8s)]
*  Photographs of probation. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2546.8s)]
*  44,000 children are about to die. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2550.8s)]
*  False propaganda. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2554.8s)]
*  I am not surrendering to it. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2556.8s)]
*  And we will. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2560.8s)]
*  Their decision. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2564.8s)]
*  The ultimate reward. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2566.8s)]
*  Recognized Palestinian state. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2570.8s)]
*  There was a Palestinian state. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2574.8s)]
*  There is no bigger prize. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2578.8s)]
*  For terror. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2582.8s)]
*  And the European countries did not bring us. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2584.8s)]
*  To leave. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2588.8s)]
*  The promising. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2590.8s)]
*  The future of Israel. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2592.8s)]
*  I think the settlers of Judea and Samaria are wondering why should they wait for their turn. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2604.8s)]
*  To duplicate the dropping policy that happened in Gaza for years. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2616.8s)]
*  To diminish the trust of the Lages and their families and other terrorists. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2626.8s)]
*  Getting those murders. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2632.8s)]
*  But we are doing enough. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2634.8s)]
*  Last year, in the last half a year. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2636.8s)]
*  Doing something that was never done before. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2640.8s)]
*  We are. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2642.8s)]
*  We have entered. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2650.8s)]
*  Simultaneously. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2652.8s)]
*  The refugee camp. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2658.8s)]
*  Crushed them. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2660.8s)]
*  Brought. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2662.8s)]
*  Statistical. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2664.8s)]
*  Decrease in terror attacks. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2666.8s)]
*  Of course this doesn't matter. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2668.8s)]
*  We did something that was not done before. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2672.8s)]
*  And it brings results. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2676.8s)]
*  We are not. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2682.8s)]
*  Allowing any terrorists. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2684.8s)]
*  It doesn't matter whether they are in Yemen, Gaza or Lebanon. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2686.8s)]
*  For the attorney general. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2694.8s)]
*  It is something that is already. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kyl_C6RUr0&t=2700.8s)]
