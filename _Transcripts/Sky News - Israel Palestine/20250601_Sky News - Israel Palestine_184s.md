# IDF issues denial after reports of at least 31 people killed in attack near aid distribution site
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U)
*  They had been queuing for food just after dawn near one of the new aid distribution [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=0.0s)]
*  points when the firing reportedly started. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=5.8s)]
*  This video appears to show that moment. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  MAN, Syrian Refugee, Jordan [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=13.92s)]
*  Everyone was on the side of the road, and they were shooting randomly at people. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=16.36s)]
*  And the Navy was shooting and exploding bombs. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=20.64s)]
*  There was no mercy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=22.8s)]
*  You say there is aid. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=24.12s)]
*  So why is this happening? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=25.72s)]
*  Some of the bodies were rushed to hospital on the back of a Donkian cart. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=29.16s)]
*  The emergency department at Nasser Hospital in Karnounis was packed. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=32.44s)]
*  A British doctor working at the hospital filmed this video. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=36.64s)]
*  These are all gunshot wounds. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=40.4s)]
*  And as you can see behind me, we've got all the bays are full and they're all gunshot [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=42.32s)]
*  wounds. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=46.8s)]
*  It's absolute carnage here and there are even more people in the main emergency department. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=47.8s)]
*  The IDF said it was unaware of any injuries and the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  has claimed the reports are false, fake, untrue and fabricated by Hamas. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  The IDF said it's actually reviewing this issue right now to see it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  They didn't have any information to give me before I came online with you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=72.28s)]
*  But I have to say that during the last week, we have heard so much propaganda coming from [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  Hamas about the humanitarian distribution point that I wouldn't be surprised if that's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=84.76s)]
*  another case like that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=90.12s)]
*  The morgue in Karnounis was overflowing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Many of the dead were brought straight here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=94.92s)]
*  The health ministry in Gaza said that all of them were either shot in the head or the chest. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=97.04s)]
*  He went to get some food for this little boy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=101.56s)]
*  Why do they shoot him? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=105.26s)]
*  Why do they tell them to go get aid? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=106.64s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=108.44s)]
*  They go there and then they treacherously kill them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=109.44s)]
*  It's sinful what they're doing to us. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  They're lying to us. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=113.68s)]
*  The IDF released this drone footage today, which they say is armed Palestinian gunmen [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=116.64s)]
*  firing at people collecting aid. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=122.26s)]
*  This was a different incident and they don't explicitly say it was Hamas. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=124.62s)]
*  But the Israeli military claims that it is an example of gunmen trying to prevent Gazans [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=130.08s)]
*  from getting food. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=135.08s)]
*  There is still a desperate need for aid in Gaza and the security situation is volatile [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=137.36s)]
*  as people will do anything to get some food. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  The UN is delivering some aid and the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says that it's handed [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=145.72s)]
*  out more than four million meals over the past week. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=149.84s)]
*  But these pictures from early on Saturday morning show how chaotic and out of control [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=152.96s)]
*  it is. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  Contractors in blue vests watch on as thousands grab what food they can. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=159.36s)]
*  Israel said that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation was set up to ensure aid didn't get to Hamas. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  But like this, there is no way they can know who is getting their hands on the food. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5SKDhriC2U&t=171.88s)]
