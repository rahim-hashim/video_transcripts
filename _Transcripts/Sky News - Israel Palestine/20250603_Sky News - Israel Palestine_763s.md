# Israel Defence Forces news briefing | Tuesday 3 June 2025
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg)
*  that have been operating in the past few months as part of the Gideon's chariot operation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=0.0s)]
*  Today three Givati combatants were buried, the Staff Sergeant and the Old Steinberg Staff Sergeant [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=5.12s)]
*  Ofek Brana and Staff Sergeant Omer Wangelder of blessed memory. All three were killed in the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  in combat in the Jabalia region in the north of the Gaza Strip. May their memory be a blessing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=18.16s)]
*  We would like to extend our condolences to the families at these difficult hours and we will [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=23.68s)]
*  continue to support them during our operations in the Jabalia region. Last night the combatants who [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=27.84s)]
*  were traveling in the hammer went on an IED. The terrorists came out from a tunnel capped and put [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=34.8s)]
*  these charges. The shaft of the tunnel which you can see now was the exit point for the terrorists [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=41.92s)]
*  and they put explosive charges through there. This is an active tunnel that is used for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=47.6s)]
*  terrorist acts and the shaft is inside a demolished building near a route and it is important to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=53.92s)]
*  emphasize this building is a military target like tens of thousands of other facilities all over [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=61.36s)]
*  Gaza that are used for terrorism. Almost every second house is to be trapped and has a shaft to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=67.84s)]
*  a tunnel. We are demolishing these buildings not for purpose of destroying it because each such a [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  building is an operational site that can harm our soldiers during the holiday. The IED forces [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=80.72s)]
*  expanded the maneuver in Gaza. We are taking over territories and cleansing them of terrorists. We [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  are in the midst of an extensive operation both above the ground and beneath the ground. So far [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=93.92s)]
*  since we've renewed the combat and since the beginning of the operation we've attacked many [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  terrorist targets throughout the Gaza Strip. Let me emphasize we are operating based on a proper [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=106.48s)]
*  plan and the purpose is to bring back the hostages and demolishing the military and governmental [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=111.68s)]
*  capabilities of Hamas. As you can see on the map that you see on the screen right now there are [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=116.64s)]
*  five divisions still operating in the Gaza Strip both conscripts and reservists. All of them are [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  out there. All of them are maneuvering and fighting. The fighting is proceeding according to the nature [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=127.92s)]
*  of this current operation. They are taking over the territory and not allowing the Hamas to return [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=133.6s)]
*  to the places they've taken over. Last week we've confirmed that the archive murderer Mohamed Sinwal [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  has been murdered. The blood of thousands of Israelis is on his hands just like other Hamas [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  activists. He was targeted and killed while he was hiding on purpose beneath the hospital. We will [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=154.48s)]
*  continue to go after the Hamas leaders wherever they are inside Gaza Strip and outside. Alongside [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=160.64s)]
*  the ongoing military pressure the grasp on the government is being constantly undermined. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=167.27999999999997s)]
*  Throughout the week the specific sites were opened in the south of the Gaza Strip in order to distribute [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=173.44s)]
*  humanitarian aid. Distributing food in such a way separates the population for Hamas and harms the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  Hamas's ability to govern. On a daily basis tens of thousands of food packages are distributed by [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=185.04s)]
*  an American company directly to the people of Gaza. In addition 1,400 trucks have been waiting on the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=190.88s)]
*  Gaza site of the transfer point. The IDF and Israel are doing whatever necessary. From there on it is [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=198.16s)]
*  the responsibility of the UN to distribute. We are doing everything we can in order to allow for [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=205.76s)]
*  the food to be distributed in an organized fashion and to make sure that the aid does not reach the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=212.0s)]
*  hands of Hamas. It has proven itself this plan. The people of Gaza reach these compounds and they [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=217.6s)]
*  understand that it's not Hamas that are taking care of them. On the contrary Hamas are trying to prevent [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=222.8s)]
*  the aid from reaching them and they understand this threat so they are acting violently and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=228.88s)]
*  they're trying to disrupt the arrival of this aid to the residents. And you could see Hamas [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=232.88s)]
*  armed activists shooting at civilians who were going to collect this aid. In southern Hanyounis [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=238.64s)]
*  they couldn't fire the terrorists from short range and through stone on Gazan civilians who tried to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  collect the aid. Hamas is losing its control over the population. It is continuing to act against [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=250.64s)]
*  its own people with terrorism, killing and violence and it is disseminating fake news and it is echoed [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=258.0s)]
*  by some of the media outlets in the west without verification. It was said that the IDF shot at [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=266.0s)]
*  civilians in an aid distribution food distribution center and that is completely unfounded and false. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=272.0s)]
*  It is propaganda of Hamas. The chief of general staff agreed what had happened there in order to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=278.24s)]
*  reach the truth. Earlier today IDF forces about half a kilometer from the compound [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=283.44s)]
*  shot at people who came close to the compound and that risked the lives of the soldiers. We are [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=290.24s)]
*  debriefing this event and we will find out the truth. We are not preventing Gazan from reaching [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=295.76s)]
*  these aid hubs. On the contrary we are allowing it. It is Hamas which is preventing it. I am aware of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=302.08s)]
*  the time about I am aware of the criticism on how long it takes to debrief and verify but because [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=308.24s)]
*  reliability is critical even if it takes time I am here to tell you the whole truth and the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=315.52s)]
*  truth in our reports even if it takes time to reach this truth we owe that truth important for [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=320.64s)]
*  most to all soldiers in this case these are reservists from brigade 179 that have come to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=325.76s)]
*  do the reserve duty once again the commander of the brigade Colonel Nuhayi he is leading his [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  combatants into the battlefield while his wife is in the delivery room as we're speaking that is the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  spirit of our soldiers since the beginning of the war they show up despite all the difficulties [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=343.68s)]
*  Hamas will pay a price for its refusal just like instructed by the chief of general staff we are [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=348.72s)]
*  increasing our fighting and we will expand our maneuvering to other areas both in the north and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  the south of the Gaza Strip we're going to continue to operate until we reach the conditions for [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=359.6s)]
*  bringing back the hostages and defeating Hamas it is prepared the idea in all regions both on the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  offensive and defensive killing terrorists and constantly taking action in order to safeguard [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=371.2s)]
*  the security of Israeli citizens that's it for now any questions [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  Ali Yushma from channel 12 news I would like to address what you said at the end one time and [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=387.68s)]
*  again there are events and incidents around the aid hub and in the meantime there's a narrative [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=394.64s)]
*  international media the Hamas claimed that 24 people were killed and over 200 injured and you [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=400.48s)]
*  are trying to debrief the event and I'd like to ask you what do you know about what happened there [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  this morning well first of all I'd like to say that this method is a new method it's unique it's [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=412.88s)]
*  creative and it actually works it works well just see what has happened over the past few days tens [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  of thousands hundreds of thousands of dozens even more are receiving food what's the bottom line [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  that's the purpose so it's going well we're going to expand this for two reasons first of all in [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=427.68s)]
*  order to feed the population like we said and also in order to under not undermine the governability [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=432.24s)]
*  of Hamas and it works you can see the facts and of course we learn from every case we improve on a [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=437.68s)]
*  daily basis we were prepared to all kinds of scenarios even worse scenarios than what we've [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  seen and we're constantly improving I talked about the incident on a sunday it never happened it took [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=449.12s)]
*  time it takes time to look into an examine I was there the chief of general staff was there to [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=454.88s)]
*  debrief we spoke with the battalion commander the brigade commander ultimately you reached the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=460.4s)]
*  individual tank that's in ongoing combat and Hamas they reported on identical numbers today [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=465.6s)]
*  and yesterday 29 today they shot as a warning they didn't hit such a number of people the way [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=473.84s)]
*  we understand it but of course we're going to continue to look into this and when we know [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=479.84s)]
*  we know that they did shoot as a warning sign towards a group of people that came there and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=483.44s)]
*  were a threat to our forces very far from the place where they're supposed to be they weren't [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=489.76s)]
*  in the marked area where they were supposed to be they shot them not in order to act words [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=494.8s)]
*  them not to harm them just as warnings we're looking into it but it's going to but we're going [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=499.36s)]
*  to reach the truth you are more of each from channel one and use it it does I think that we [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  should sell combatants send combatants to Gaza after having fought for 18 months and now they [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=510.24s)]
*  claim they can no longer continue to fight look first of all it's important to say that we truly [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=515.2s)]
*  appreciate and value our soldiers who are doing an excellent job in all sectors we've never seen [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=520.72s)]
*  such a war except for the 1948 war of independence perhaps tens of thousands of reservists as we're [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=526.32s)]
*  speaking are out there in combat and many more than that they all up the regular divisions [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=532.64s)]
*  and brigades are fighting and also in the center of the country and in the north of the country [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  we see high motivation I'd like to say that I see that both among reservists and the conscripts [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  they have a high combat spirit alongside that like I said it's a challenging war it's been going on [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=550.72s)]
*  for a long time these are specific individual cases that you're talking about we're looking [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=556.16s)]
*  into the situation the commanders have a freedom in action to react in whatever way they choose in [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=560.96s)]
*  their units from I-24 news is there a fear of chaos in the Gaza Strip that might risk the hostages [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=567.12s)]
*  in such a way that you won't have a counterpart for a deal look it's a gradual campaign we do [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=577.6s)]
*  have a well-organized program as we've said in the past let me say first of all that we are prepared [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=583.6s)]
*  we are flexible enough to provide a response to whatever situation evolves bringing back the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=589.52s)]
*  hostages is of course something we're constantly focusing on and we are prepared for any kind of [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=596.72s)]
*  negotiation that will succeed in order to bring them back home we are operating in a systemic and [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=602.0s)]
*  methodic manner and we're constantly assessing the situation and preparing for every scenario [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=608.0s)]
*  I cannot elaborate beyond that but these issues are things that we're constantly thinking about [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=613.04s)]
*  from Ynet this past Sunday pro-Palestinian activists left on a boat from Sicily in order [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=620.24s)]
*  to break the siege on Gaza so far we haven't seen any comment then either from Israel or the IDF on [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=626.16s)]
*  this subject could you inform Israelis what the IDF plans to do with this flotilla? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=631.52s)]
*  The IDF is prepared for protecting Israeli citizens in all sectors in the north in the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=638.64s)]
*  south in the center and in the maritime sector as well we are prepared to defend Israel's borders [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=645.04s)]
*  we're prepared but I'm not going to elaborate on how we're preparing we've accumulated some [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=652.48s)]
*  experience in recent years and we're going to act accordingly. Last week we have published [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=657.04s)]
*  that the activities of the army have risked the lives of at least 51 hostages since the beginning [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=665.76s)]
*  of the war one operation four weeks ago risked the lives of Matan Eitzenganker and Nitan Alexander [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=671.04s)]
*  and it has been said to the media that it did not risk their lives but a Nav, Matan's mother said [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=677.68s)]
*  that where they were in the tunnel they could feel and smell the gases can you tell us that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=684.24s)]
*  the military maneuver as part of getting chariots will not harm and risk the hostages? First of all [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lvMhKbYDg&t=689.68s)]
