# Doctors on the frontline: Victoria Rose and Tom Potokar take you inside the war in Gaza
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk)
*  The [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=0.0s)]
*  the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=3.06s)]
*  Gaza is a sliver of land where hospitals have become frontline targets. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=8.06s)]
*  Absolutely massive strike on EGH hospital. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=18.06s)]
*  And operating theatres are on the battlefield. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=21.06s)]
*  Everyone is target, everyone is play again. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  Doctors, children. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  In this film, two British surgeons recorded their first-hand experiences over a three-week period. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=33.12s)]
*  The emaciated bodies lying on the operating table. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=39.12s)]
*  Dr Tom Patoka, a burns and reconstructive specialist. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=42.12s)]
*  This was so barbaric. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=46.12s)]
*  And Dr Victoria Rose, a plastic surgeon, are both driven by one motive. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=49.12s)]
*  This is the little 10-year-old boy whose ankle got blown off. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=54.18s)]
*  Saving lives. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=58.18s)]
*  What they witnessed demands to be shown. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=59.18s)]
*  And she's had a liver injury, so shrapnel here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=62.18s)]
*  It's the total inhumanity and the cruelty. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=65.17999999999999s)]
*  It's absolute carnage here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=69.17999999999999s)]
*  This guy's been brought in for malnutrition. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=74.17999999999999s)]
*  The sound of rockets and shelling. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  This is the daily life in Gaza. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Tom Patoka is awarded the Nobel Prize for the best film. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  And the Nobel Prize for best film. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  Tom Patoka is a war zone veteran. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=101.3s)]
*  He's the former chief surgeon of the International Red Cross. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=104.3s)]
*  And seen the worst in the world's bloodiest conflict areas. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=111.3s)]
*  He's been traveling to Gaza for the past seven years. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=115.3s)]
*  But this visit's about to turn into one unmatched before in intensity and violence. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=118.3s)]
*  Within days of arriving, two of Gaza's main hospitals are hit. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=124.36s)]
*  Including the European, where he's working. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  The Israeli forces will later confirm they dropped 50 bombs in this operation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  The Israeli attack on the city of Gaza is a major blow to the Israeli forces. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  The Israeli attacks are unleashed without warning. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  The strikes are against two of the last functioning hospitals in Gaza. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  A security camera in front of the emergency entrance of the European hospital shows the moments before. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=171.48s)]
*  Note the man in the checked shirt on the left. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=178.48s)]
*  Top right you can see the first of the bombs dropping. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=184.48s)]
*  Before anyone can escape, a barrage of others follow. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=188.48s)]
*  Before anyone can escape, a barrage of others follow. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=192.54s)]
*  The Israeli forces will justify this by saying they're targeting Hamas tunnels beneath. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=201.54s)]
*  Hospitals have protected status in war and attacking them as a war crime. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=206.54s)]
*  You can see the man in the checked shirt emerging from all the dust and debris. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=211.54s)]
*  And Dr Tom Patoka is on the scene within minutes and begins documenting what he sees. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=216.6s)]
*  Absolutely massive strike on EGH hospital. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=223.6s)]
*  It's right in front of the emergency room. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=228.6s)]
*  People are on the ground. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=231.6s)]
*  Stratnil everywhere. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=234.6s)]
*  Devastation right in the forecourt of the hospital. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=236.6s)]
*  Absolutely terrible. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=239.6s)]
*  This is the corridor going down to main theatres. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=240.6s)]
*  The theatres are full of home. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=244.66s)]
*  It's just, you know, absolutely terrible. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=247.66s)]
*  It's a direct hit on the hospital. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=255.66s)]
*  Cocked up, I see from the smoke. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  It's going up towards the accident emergency unit. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  His footage clearly shows a huge number of patients and staff in the hospital. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  Chaos at the moment. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=273.72s)]
*  The IDF drops multiple bombs on the European hospital that day, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=279.72s)]
*  with at least 12 craters visible around the area. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=284.72s)]
*  When Dr Tom and team first arrive in Gaza at the start of May, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=288.72s)]
*  these are the only major hospitals still in operation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=291.72s)]
*  By the time they all leave at the end of the month, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=295.72s)]
*  almost a third will have been taken out of action. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=298.72s)]
*  There ends up being more than 30 attacks on medical facilities [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  while the doctors are there, as well as on at least five hospitals. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  Those put out of action include Al-Aouda, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  which has been operating as the main medical facility in the north at this point. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  And there's the bulldozing of the only dialysis clinic, again in the north. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=317.78000000000003s)]
*  With the European out of action, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  Nasser is now the most functional hospital left for the whole population. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  Dr Victoria Rose and her colleagues arrive in Gaza on the day this is all unfolding. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  We've just got to Gaza. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=339.78000000000003s)]
*  We've entered through a different entry point today. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  They're meant to go to the European hospital, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  but hearing of the bombing there instead head to Nasser to wait for the casualties. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=348.78000000000003s)]
*  The London-based NHS surgeon is on her third visit to Gaza. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  She's already realising her duties are twofold, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=358.84s)]
*  saving lives but also bearing witness. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=361.84s)]
*  Foreign journalists are barred from entering, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=365.84s)]
*  many of those inside are being killed. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=368.84s)]
*  She knows international doctors can be the voice of Gazans, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=370.84s)]
*  and she's determined to do that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=374.84s)]
*  Before dawn's same morning, Nasser's also been hit. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=378.84s)]
*  The strike kills an injured journalist. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=384.84s)]
*  Gaza! [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=386.9s)]
*  Two Israeli forces say there's a Hamas operative involved in October 7 attacks, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=388.9s)]
*  which he always denied. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=392.9s)]
*  The hospital bombings follow a pattern of attacks on Gaza's health services, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=395.9s)]
*  those working in them and reporting about them. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=399.9s)]
*  These attacks terrorise the people, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=403.9s)]
*  as well as the staff who work here, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=406.9s)]
*  who tell us that they are terrified [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=410.9s)]
*  that if they continue to keep coming to work, they will be next. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=413.96s)]
*  The newly injured from the European hospital bombings start arriving at Nasser, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=420.96s)]
*  where Dr Victoria and her team are. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=424.96s)]
*  It's already heavily overstretched, but now more important than ever. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=427.96s)]
*  The grief here never stops. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=437.96s)]
*  And his tibias, which are the shin bones, and he's lost a huge amount of skin. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=440.02s)]
*  Dr Victoria finds her operations list immediately full of mainly young patients, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=445.02s)]
*  many now on their own or with few surviving relatives. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=451.02s)]
*  And she's had a liver injury, so shrapnel here, into the liver. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=455.02s)]
*  This is Yaqub, who had a blast injury, I think we just spoke about him before. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=460.02s)]
*  So a bomb went off and it's basically blown his right ankle off. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=466.08s)]
*  She begins a daily video blog [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=471.08s)]
*  and shares her experiences, her patients and their injuries with us and on social media. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=476.08s)]
*  This is from an explosion burn. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=482.08s)]
*  I think I've felt at times that this was so barbaric, what was going on, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=485.08s)]
*  in terms of the numbers of children coming through the doors with bits of their bodies blown off, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=492.14s)]
*  that it just had to be, it had to be displayed. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=498.14s)]
*  I felt a real duty to show what I've seen and say, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=503.14s)]
*  look, I'm seeing what they've told you they're seeing. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=508.14s)]
*  If this is actually really happening, you've got to look at this now. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=511.14s)]
*  Back at the European, Dr Tom is witnessing the frantic moving out of all places. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=517.14s)]
*  He's telling his patients that they can. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=522.14s)]
*  Weeks later, the Israelis will say they found the body of the latest Hamas leader, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=525.14s)]
*  beneath the hospital, but his name is not among the 30 plus killed at this stage. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=529.14s)]
*  The attack embodies the disputing versions of what's happening in Gaza. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=534.14s)]
*  Israelis will again claim this proves Hamas hides behind civilians, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=541.14s)]
*  whilst the Palestinians say it demonstrates the military's disregard for civilian safety. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=545.14s)]
*  Dr Tom sees it as a fight for survival and saving lives. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=550.1999999999999s)]
*  Just standing outside the operating theatre, you can see the damage behind me. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=554.1999999999999s)]
*  It's not even possible to take any cases to theatre. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=558.1999999999999s)]
*  It is too dangerous. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=561.1999999999999s)]
*  The theatres are being damaged and the staff, unsurprisingly, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=563.1999999999999s)]
*  have left at the moment to try and seek some safety. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=566.1999999999999s)]
*  The next day, it's evident the damage is wide and extensive. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  But Dr Tom and his Palestinian colleagues are still holding out hope [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=576.26s)]
*  of getting the hospital back up and running. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=581.26s)]
*  And they're doing what they can to shift the rubble. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=588.26s)]
*  Busy clearing up the mess from last night's attack outside theatre. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=595.26s)]
*  Here you can see the maintenance team are trying to get things back in order [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  so we can start operating again. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=606.3199999999999s)]
*  There are still patients in ICU and then there are fresh attacks. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=610.3199999999999s)]
*  This is where the strike was. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=615.3199999999999s)]
*  You can see the digger underneath trying to clear the rubble that's been hit. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=617.3199999999999s)]
*  Israel's fresh military offensive is in full attack mode by now. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  It's called Operation Gideon's Chariots. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=629.38s)]
*  And the IDF says in just one week they've hit nearly 700 Hamas targets across Gaza. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=632.38s)]
*  Most of the European hospital patients have been stretchered out by now. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=640.38s)]
*  But a few medics opt to stay until all can be taken to safety. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=645.38s)]
*  The rest of the hospital is now evacuated and to all extents and purposes abandoned. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=653.3800000000001s)]
*  So this is the last remaining area of clinical activity. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=658.4399999999999s)]
*  The emergency medical teams are coming to take the patients away. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=663.4399999999999s)]
*  There's still another five to go so we're hoping that they'll be able to find places [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  and come and pick these patients up before too long. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  And we intend to remain here until the last patient left the unit. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=676.4399999999999s)]
*  We hope for the best for all of us in this difficult time in the European country. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=681.5s)]
*  If you really want to see the real heroes of humanity, you can see them here. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=690.5s)]
*  These are the paramedics, the ambulance drivers, the doctors and nurses who have stayed behind [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=696.5s)]
*  to look after these few patients. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=701.5s)]
*  Understanding the risks that they're taking, that they still do their job with dignity, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=704.56s)]
*  with respect, with humility. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=709.56s)]
*  These are true humanitarian human beings. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=713.56s)]
*  We've just left the European Gaza Hospital, Milena and myself. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=721.56s)]
*  We're going to be in the hospital for a few days. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=727.56s)]
*  We've just left the European Gaza Hospital, Milena and myself, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=730.6199999999999s)]
*  and now we're on our way back to the guest house. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=734.6199999999999s)]
*  We'll see what we can do after this, but very grateful to Norway and the UN [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=740.6199999999999s)]
*  for coming to get us out. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=745.6199999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately the hospital where we were deployed is off the border. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=749.6199999999999s)]
*  There was no electricity, no water. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=752.6199999999999s)]
*  It will be probably repaired within two weeks. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=755.6199999999999s)]
*  We are looking for another appropriate place to continue our mission. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=758.68s)]
*  The complete Israeli blockade on aid is biting hard. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=765.68s)]
*  Hunger is hitting the youngest most harshly. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=775.68s)]
*  The impact of this siege is keenly felt at NASA Hospital, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=782.6800000000001s)]
*  where Dr. Tom and Dr. Victoria and their teams are both now working. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=786.7399999999999s)]
*  They've just brought me to the paediatric center [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=792.7399999999999s)]
*  to have a look at some of the children this guy's been brought in for malnutrition. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=795.7399999999999s)]
*  So is this little guy. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=802.7399999999999s)]
*  Really shocking. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=809.7399999999999s)]
*  So that's what she used to look like. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=811.74s)]
*  The aquarium needs special formula held up by the blockade. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=814.8s)]
*  So from that, and that's this. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=818.8s)]
*  The little girl's deterioration is painful and slow, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=826.8s)]
*  but there's very little anyone can do. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=833.8s)]
*  She dies waiting for the aid which never comes. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=836.8599999999999s)]
*  And there are so many others still wanting, still suffering. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=840.8599999999999s)]
*  Even a search for food can be deadly. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=844.8599999999999s)]
*  There's the sound of rockets and shelling been going on all day. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=847.8599999999999s)]
*  Terrible news coming out from the north of the country. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=853.8599999999999s)]
*  Our driver today is a man who was killed in a car accident. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=859.8599999999999s)]
*  Our driver today was on the phone to his son-in-law in Gaza City [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=863.92s)]
*  pleading with him not to go out as it was too dangerous, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=868.92s)]
*  but he was starving. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=873.92s)]
*  He went out looking for food. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=875.92s)]
*  He was killed. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=877.92s)]
*  This is the daily life in Gaza. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=879.92s)]
*  Quite a productive day here, probably because we've got Tom back. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=883.92s)]
*  They're doing at least 10 surgeries a day, and the bulk are children. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=886.92s)]
*  This is the little 10-year-old boy whose ankle got blown off. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=893.92s)]
*  Graham shortened the bone, and Tiz and I have just put this piece of skin [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=898.92s)]
*  that we've taken from his thigh onto it to cover the hole. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=905.92s)]
*  So hopefully, hopefully job done, sorted. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=910.92s)]
*  This is the third little guy that I've done today. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=918.9200000000001s)]
*  He's got a blast injury to his legs. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=923.92s)]
*  So the right one we've had to shorten because he's lost some bone, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=930.92s)]
*  and the left one he's got a huge hole in. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=934.92s)]
*  So he's number three. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=937.92s)]
*  The little guy behind him, he's a 35, 40% burn. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=939.92s)]
*  He was number two. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=944.92s)]
*  And my first little girl, she was under a year old, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=946.92s)]
*  and she had a burn to her hand. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=950.9200000000001s)]
*  And those they do patch up face incredible challenges. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=953.92s)]
*  Obviously, I see malnutrition differently in the trauma patients [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=961.92s)]
*  because it comes across in terms of poor healing, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=966.92s)]
*  not having the essential nutrients and vitamins that you need [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=970.92s)]
*  means that cell turnover is not as good as it should be, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=974.92s)]
*  and your capacity to heal wounds is pretty poor. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=979.9799999999999s)]
*  Two weeks into their trip, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=985.9799999999999s)]
*  and we sense the doctor's frustration is turning to anger. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=986.9799999999999s)]
*  It's the screams of children when they're waking up from an anesthetic, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=990.9799999999999s)]
*  for example. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=996.9799999999999s)]
*  It's the sight of a child coming, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=997.9799999999999s)]
*  or one we've got to go and operate on shortly [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1001.9799999999999s)]
*  and have been operating on every day for the last few days. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1004.98s)]
*  She's seven years old and is limbless from the top of the thighs [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1008.04s)]
*  on both sides, and she's seven years old, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1015.04s)]
*  and that you never get used to. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1018.04s)]
*  And it is just, yeah, it's the total inhumanity and the cruelty of it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1023.04s)]
*  I just have to show you this little guy. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1029.04s)]
*  This is my favorite little guy. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1031.04s)]
*  He has a 35% burn. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1033.04s)]
*  It's a massive burn for a little guy like this. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1038.04s)]
*  He's so adorable. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1041.04s)]
*  His eyelids are burnt, his hands are burnt, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1043.04s)]
*  and his feet are burnt. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1046.04s)]
*  This is just really completely unnecessary. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1048.04s)]
*  The toddler is Hartam, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1054.04s)]
*  and his family photo album shows him as a happy, healthy boy [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1056.04s)]
*  before the bombing. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1059.04s)]
*  His father was a teacher, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1062.04s)]
*  but was killed alongside his pregnant mother. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1064.04s)]
*  Now Hartam is the family's sole survivor. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1066.1s)]
*  His life is hanging on a thread, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1074.1s)]
*  and Dr. Victoria is monitoring every step. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1076.1s)]
*  Unfortunately, he hasn't been too well recently. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1079.1s)]
*  He's developed some bleeding from his intestines, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1083.1s)]
*  which we've noticed in his stools, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1086.1s)]
*  and this isn't uncommon from a big burn. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1089.1s)]
*  It's a stress ulcer, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1092.1s)]
*  but it's not something that we normally see [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1094.1599999999999s)]
*  in somebody of his age. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1096.1599999999999s)]
*  We're trying to support him as much as we can. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1098.1599999999999s)]
*  He's had quite a lot of blood transfusion, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1100.1599999999999s)]
*  and he's got a tube in his nose now [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1102.1599999999999s)]
*  to try and get some nutrients and vitamins in him. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1104.1599999999999s)]
*  But unfortunately, we've had to delay his surgery [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1107.1599999999999s)]
*  until he's a little bit fitter. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1111.1599999999999s)]
*  So we're keeping everything crossed. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1113.1599999999999s)]
*  He's holding his own at the moment. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1116.1599999999999s)]
*  His guardian now, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1118.1599999999999s)]
*  and the man who's hardly left his hospital bed, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1120.1599999999999s)]
*  is his grandfather, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1122.22s)]
*  who's working with a British charity [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1123.22s)]
*  to get Hartam airlifted to safety. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1125.22s)]
*  But despite constant appeals, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1128.22s)]
*  so far no visas have been granted. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1130.22s)]
*  In more than 20 months, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1133.22s)]
*  the UK's taken fewer than a handful of the injured [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1135.22s)]
*  from Gaza, just two children. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1137.22s)]
*  What did children do wrong to suffer such injuries, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1139.22s)]
*  to be burned and bombed? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1143.22s)]
*  We ask God to grant them healing. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1145.22s)]
*  Evening bombing. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1147.28s)]
*  Their video blogs are showing the attacks [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1149.28s)]
*  becoming more intense. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1151.28s)]
*  And constant Israeli drones are scouting [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1155.28s)]
*  for the next target, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1157.28s)]
*  delivering another level of terror. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1159.28s)]
*  They call it the Gaza lullaby, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1165.28s)]
*  the constant sounds of anarchy and terror. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1167.28s)]
*  Dr. Victoria and her colleague Dr. Graham Groom [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1170.28s)]
*  fall into a pattern of nightly updates. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1173.28s)]
*  And humour helps them cope. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1177.28s)]
*  This is an unusual raising room. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1179.28s)]
*  We're actually being bombed on the balcony. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1183.28s)]
*  In calls from Gaza, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1186.28s)]
*  the teams tell us what's happening on the ground. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1188.28s)]
*  Where everyone is a target, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1190.28s)]
*  everyone is there again. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1192.28s)]
*  It is the entire population that's being hit. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1194.28s)]
*  Be that doctors, children, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1198.28s)]
*  teachers, teachers, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1200.28s)]
*  teachers, teachers, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1202.28s)]
*  teachers, teachers, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1204.28s)]
*  children, teachers. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1206.34s)]
*  It is just indiscriminate who's going. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1208.34s)]
*  But I think the actual destruction of the structures [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1210.34s)]
*  is very, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1216.34s)]
*  it seems to be very planned or calculated [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1218.34s)]
*  the way in which the hospitals [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1221.34s)]
*  are being rendered functionless. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1223.34s)]
*  They know right now [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1225.34s)]
*  they're the Palestinians' best hope as witnesses. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1227.34s)]
*  If there's nothing to hide, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1229.34s)]
*  well, one international journalist allowed it. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1231.34s)]
*  If there's nothing to hide, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1234.3999999999999s)]
*  why have so many Palestinian journalists been slaughtered? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1236.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, people should perhaps be asking that question. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1238.3999999999999s)]
*  It's been non-stop. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1241.3999999999999s)]
*  We've seen about 12 to 15 patients on the ward. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1245.3999999999999s)]
*  The doctors' video blogs are gaining a lot of traction [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1248.3999999999999s)]
*  on social media platforms. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1251.3999999999999s)]
*  We need the aid. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1253.3999999999999s)]
*  And they're creating a lot of noise. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1255.3999999999999s)]
*  Tell me about the situation where you are. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1257.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, Dr. Ruiz joins me now from NASA Hospital in Khan Unis. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1259.3999999999999s)]
*  Dr. Patoka, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1263.46s)]
*  It's the worst I've ever seen it in Gaza. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1270.46s)]
*  What do you want people to hear from you? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1273.46s)]
*  Frankly, I want to stop having to give these interviews. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1275.46s)]
*  It really has reached the point of utter inhumanity. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1278.46s)]
*  The bombing of hospitals and medics goes on, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1283.46s)]
*  even as Israel seems to bow to US pressure [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1286.46s)]
*  and says it will allow some aid in. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1289.46s)]
*  But this attack on a doctor's family home [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1291.52s)]
*  really rocks the teams working at NASA Hospital. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1294.52s)]
*  The bundles being carried out are the charred remains [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1300.52s)]
*  of nine of the doctors' children. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1303.52s)]
*  Their parents are both medics, both based at NASA. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1306.52s)]
*  Their mother, Dr. Ala, only escapes because she was [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1312.52s)]
*  at the hospital working. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1315.52s)]
*  Their father, Dr. Ruiz, is a doctor. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1317.52s)]
*  Their father's critically wounded. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1320.58s)]
*  Just one child, Adam, survives, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1323.58s)]
*  but may need his arm amputated [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1326.58s)]
*  and he's taken to intensive care. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1328.58s)]
*  He'll need much surgery ahead. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1331.58s)]
*  He's in ICU with his father, but his father never recovers. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1334.58s)]
*  Being a health worker in Gaza is one of the most dangerous [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1340.58s)]
*  jobs in the world right now, and all here know it. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1343.58s)]
*  It's quite late. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1346.6399999999999s)]
*  I think it's nearly midnight now, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1348.6399999999999s)]
*  and it's been another really busy day of operating. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1350.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes, it has, and also a sad day. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1355.6399999999999s)]
*  The last patient on my list today was an 11-year-old boy [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1359.6399999999999s)]
*  who seemed much younger as he lifted him [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1363.6399999999999s)]
*  onto the operating table. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1365.6399999999999s)]
*  His injuries were bad enough, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1368.6399999999999s)]
*  but the background, I think, was worse. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1371.6399999999999s)]
*  In an attack that may or not have been aimed at his father, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1374.7s)]
*  his father was very badly injured, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1379.7s)]
*  but nine of his brothers and sisters were killed. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1382.7s)]
*  Childhoods are snuffed out in an instant. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1386.7s)]
*  A little girl picks her way out through the fire [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1389.7s)]
*  of an Israeli airstrike, alone. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1392.7s)]
*  More than half of those killed here turn out to be children. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1394.7s)]
*  The toddler is called Haneen. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1398.76s)]
*  Her courage has saved her life. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1405.76s)]
*  But she is suffering and now an orphan. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1411.76s)]
*  Her uncle is all that remains of her family. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1416.76s)]
*  We appeal to the world, to anyone with a conscience, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1420.76s)]
*  how much longer will you remain a child? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1423.76s)]
*  Imagine this was your daughter, your sister. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1426.82s)]
*  This is injustice. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1429.82s)]
*  Where is the world? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1431.82s)]
*  What have we done to deserve this? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1433.82s)]
*  18 children formed the bulk of the dead [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1439.82s)]
*  in this single attack. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1442.82s)]
*  Later we find out the journalist who filmed the fire [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1447.82s)]
*  is himself killed in an Israeli strike. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1450.82s)]
*  As well as one of the civil defence workers [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1453.8799999999999s)]
*  taking part in the rescue. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1455.8799999999999s)]
*  The attacks, with the high child casualties, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1458.8799999999999s)]
*  leaves the travelling doctors increasingly emotional [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1461.8799999999999s)]
*  as the end of their trip looms. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1464.8799999999999s)]
*  We can no longer just stand here [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1468.8799999999999s)]
*  and tell you what is happening on the ground. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1470.8799999999999s)]
*  The emaciated bodies lying on the operating table, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1473.8799999999999s)]
*  huge chunks of flesh missing. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1476.8799999999999s)]
*  I want to talk to you about the political plants [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1479.8799999999999s)]
*  that are complicit in this ongoing slaughter and starvation. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1481.94s)]
*  They appear on the news shows, give interviews [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1484.94s)]
*  and try to justify what is happening. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1487.94s)]
*  They have no idea how dangerous their words are. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1490.94s)]
*  They have never been here. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1493.94s)]
*  They have never seen with their own eyes [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1496.94s)]
*  what is going on with it. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1499.94s)]
*  They heard the screams, smelt the rotting flesh, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1502.94s)]
*  and shuddered from the constant bombardment. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1505.94s)]
*  The new Israeli aid distribution system leads to chaos. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1509.0s)]
*  There is mass panic and multiple claims over multiple days [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1515.0s)]
*  that the Israeli forces are shooting at hungry Palestinians. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1520.0s)]
*  The doctors deal with the aftermath. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1523.0s)]
*  These are all gunshot wounds. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1526.0s)]
*  As you can see behind me, we have all the bays full [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1529.0s)]
*  and they are all gunshot wounds. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1532.0s)]
*  It is absolute carnage here and there are even more people [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1535.0s)]
*  in the main emergency department. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1538.06s)]
*  If you come through. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1541.06s)]
*  This huge emergency coincides with the doctors' departure. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1551.06s)]
*  We are in a very short period of time [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1560.06s)]
*  where we could make a difference here and stop the war. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1563.06s)]
*  If we don't, I don't think there will be anything to come back to. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1566.12s)]
*  To be honest, I am angry at what is happening here [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1573.12s)]
*  and the fact that it is still happening [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1578.12s)]
*  and the fact that still the reaction is negligible [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1581.12s)]
*  in terms of action. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1586.12s)]
*  They make their way through the rubble that was once Gaza [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1590.12s)]
*  with a UN escort and hear of more hospitals being hit, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1593.1799999999998s)]
*  more casualties for their colleagues left behind to cope with. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1596.1799999999998s)]
*  This is possibly my last message from Gaza [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1602.1799999999998s)]
*  which is very sad really [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1605.1799999999998s)]
*  because I am a bit worried about everybody that we have left [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycLTzFFkwk&t=1608.1799999999998s)]
