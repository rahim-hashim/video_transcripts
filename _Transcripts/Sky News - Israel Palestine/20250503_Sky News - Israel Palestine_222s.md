# Israeli military reservists call for end to war in Gaza
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY)
*  It's only 40 miles from Guy Porin's Tel Aviv flat to Gaza, and the war is on his mind. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=0.0s)]
*  This retired Air Force pilot is from a military family. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=10.14s)]
*  Now there is dissent in its ranks. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=14.22s)]
*  Around 1200 serving and former Air Force pilots have signed an open letter. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=17.64s)]
*  They want the war to end in order to get the hostages out. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=23.68s)]
*  The Air Force people demand the return of the hostages home without delay, even at the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=28.18s)]
*  price of stopping the war immediately. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=34.34s)]
*  At this time, the war serves primarily political and personal interests and not security ones. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=37.06s)]
*  Why is it that this carries so much weight? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  The Air Force historically has been the major force and the major game changer in all of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=48.18s)]
*  Israel's wars, including this current one. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=56.58s)]
*  And the people, the public knows it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=61.18s)]
*  So for them, if there is no, the Air Force, the strength of the Air Force is their guarantee [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=63.739999999999995s)]
*  of security. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=70.08s)]
*  And their campaign is growing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=71.86s)]
*  Some 15,000 people from every part of the military have signed similar open letters, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=74.42s)]
*  including intelligence, paratroopers, tank units, special forces, and medics like Dr. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=80.86s)]
*  Ofer Havokuk. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=88.02s)]
*  He served 200 days during this war, mostly in Gaza, and believes the government is waging [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=89.6s)]
*  war to stay in power. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=95.3s)]
*  A ceasefire could lead to the collapse of the prime minister's far-right coalition. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=97.82s)]
*  Netanyahu wants to keep his coalition working and to keep the coalition together. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=102.94s)]
*  And for him, this is the main purpose of the war, unfortunately. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=108.22s)]
*  The government says this is to pressure Hamas. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=112.42s)]
*  What we feel is that the war has no purpose and it's going on and on without any direction [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=115.02s)]
*  and without an end. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=120.9s)]
*  And our feeling is that the hostages, they have no time. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=123.74s)]
*  And we believe that the most important thing to do is to get the release of the hostages [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=127.56s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=132.3s)]
*  The Israeli military has threatened to dismiss those who signed protest letters. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  This active reservist didn't want to be identified. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=139.86s)]
*  Yes, I am worried. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=142.9s)]
*  But this is a price that I'm willing to pay, although it is very big for me because I'm [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=145.82000000000002s)]
*  volunteering. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=152.74s)]
*  And as a volunteer, I wanted to stay on duty for as long as I can. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=153.74s)]
*  Israeli society is growing weary of war. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=163.70000000000002s)]
*  But the government insists it must go on to destroy Hamas. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=167.54000000000002s)]
*  There are deep divisions within Israeli society about the war in Gaza. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=172.78s)]
*  Some people are totally against it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=177.78s)]
*  Others want to ceasefire just to get the hostages out. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=180.46s)]
*  But with units across the Israeli military now speaking out, the government is coming [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=183.46s)]
*  under increasing pressure. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=189.62s)]
*  The Prime Minister says the original letter was written by a small group of bad apples. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=191.94s)]
*  Guy Paran says that's not true. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=201.54s)]
*  That when people who served in the air force come out against a war, people in Israel take [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=206.62s)]
*  notice. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEFmL9mDuY&t=213.14000000000001s)]
