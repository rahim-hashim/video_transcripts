# Conditions 'created' for Gaza ceasefire
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w)
*  Good evening. We started the week talking about the prospect of a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=0.0s)]
*  And last night, sky sources suggested Israel and Hamas were moving closer to an agreement, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=5.0s)]
*  except for one sticking point. And it's a big one. Where will Israeli forces remain [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=10.74s)]
*  in Gaza after any ceasefire is declared? And crucially, for how long? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  First comes strength, then comes the peace. And we hope that we'll realise the fruits [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=20.28s)]
*  of strength very soon, in peace. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=27.28s)]
*  That was Benjamin Netanyahu, and he was saying peace through strength, according to him. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=30.78s)]
*  He's holding almost daily talks in Washington with Donald Trump, all whilst parallel negotiations [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=35.78s)]
*  take place in Qatar. The US president is still hopeful of substantial progress this week. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=41.56s)]
*  I think we have a chance this week or next week. Not definitely. There's nothing definite [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=47.28s)]
*  about war and Gaza and all of the other places that we all deal with so much. But there's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=53.72s)]
*  a very good chance that we'll have a settlement, an agreement of some kind this week and maybe [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=60.84s)]
*  next week if not. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=66.68s)]
*  And in the past hour, Hamas says it has agreed to release 10 hostages, though the timeline [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=69.6s)]
*  is unclear. Let's just bring in our international correspondent, John Sparks, who joins us from [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=74.32s)]
*  Washington. And John, we keep being told that they're closer and closer to some kind [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=79.56s)]
*  of ceasefire deal, and there seems to be these small sticking points, almost like we've been [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=85.44s)]
*  here before. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=91.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think that is absolutely right, Yelda. I think this week the US has presented a version [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=92.44s)]
*  of reality that they are getting closer and closer to a ceasefire deal, that the momentum [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=100.56s)]
*  is building. And I think the presence of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=106.36s)]
*  in Washington has lent itself to that. I mean, he will have been, by the time he's finished, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=111.56s)]
*  he will have been here for four days. And that means that Trump, and they've had several [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=116.96s)]
*  meetings already, he's been able to put personal pressure on him. He's been able to do it in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=121.64s)]
*  the face. And you know what? Netanyahu owes him, right? The Americans came in during the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=126.88s)]
*  attack on Iran with their high-tech bombers and their big munitions. So Netanyahu owes [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=132.22s)]
*  the Americans. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=137.74s)]
*  But there do seem to be issues here that they are really struggling to solve. And it has [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=139.82s)]
*  been reported here that a Qatari interlocutor was in the White House for meetings yesterday [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=145.9s)]
*  evening that have been described as tense and difficult. And those were about the withdrawal [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=152.46s)]
*  of Israeli forces, the IDF. How far would they withdraw to in event of a ceasefire [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=158.18s)]
*  deal, in event of an agreement being reached? Those discussions were very difficult. It [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=165.38s)]
*  has been reported. Eventually, the Israelis came back with a new map showing a wider area [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=170.1s)]
*  that they would be prepared to withdraw to. Again, we then thought, right, new momentum. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=176.06s)]
*  We've got new momentum here. But then we moved to today, and Trump, he was meeting with five [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=183.3s)]
*  African leaders. He was asked about the Gaza ceasefire. And as we've heard, he said, maybe [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=189.82s)]
*  this week, maybe next week. But it's difficult. It didn't feel like they're on the verge of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=195.5s)]
*  an agreement. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=201.82s)]
*  And then we have had a statement released by Hamas tonight, and I'm going to read a [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=202.7s)]
*  little bit of that for you. In this statement, Hamas have said, in its keenness to succeed [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=208.1s)]
*  in the ongoing efforts, the movement has shown the necessary flexibility and agreed to release [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=214.98s)]
*  10 prisoners. Now, I do think that is significant. They say they're agreeing to release 10 prisoners [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=221.14s)]
*  if there is a deal. That's up from eight. That's up from eight hostages. They go on [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=227.54s)]
*  to say the key points remain under negotiation. Foremost among them, the flow of aid, the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=232.9s)]
*  withdrawal of the occupation from the territories of the Gaza Strip. That's Israeli soldiers. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=238.94s)]
*  And the provision of real guarantees for a permanent ceasefire. I'll go on. Despite the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=245.26s)]
*  difficulty of negotiations on these issues, so far, due to the occupations in transigence, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=250.58s)]
*  they're referring to the Israelis there, we continue to work seriously and with a positive [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=256.74s)]
*  spirit. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=262.46000000000004s)]
*  So, I mean, that's the Americans have been saying three of four issues have been solved. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=263.46000000000004s)]
*  There we've got Hamas raising more than one issue there. It does seem like they there [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=270.18s)]
*  is a long way to go. Netanyahu is here. He'll be here until tomorrow evening. I think the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=275.18s)]
*  Americans would like to have something to announce while he is here. But I think we're [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=283.38s)]
*  witnessing a different reality here, Yelda. This is a different reality that is much more [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=288.3s)]
*  difficult. We are looking ultimately at a very difficult problem to solve. The Israelis, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=293.3s)]
*  Netanyahu has promised, he has pledged to eliminate Hamas in its entirety. Hamas is [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=299.14s)]
*  committed to ensuring its existence. That is a very difficult problem to solve for the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=305.42s)]
*  interlocutors, for the Americans, the Qataris, the Egyptians. And I think we're seeing the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=310.82s)]
*  fruits of that right now. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And John, as we said at the beginning of this conversation, it feels [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=316.58s)]
*  very much like we've been here before. Thank you so much for bringing us up to date. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA0MA8PXA1w&t=321.46s)]
