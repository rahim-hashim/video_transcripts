# IDF confirm deadly strikes on Gazan hospitals
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg)
*  Massive strikes on the European hospital. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, the pictures filmed by people who were nearby [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=2.4s)]
*  show a series, like a chain of explosions [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=5.36s)]
*  and plumes of black smoke, terrifying for anyone [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=9.68s)]
*  close to it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=14.4s)]
*  It looks as though possibly they were using perhaps [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  some sort of bunker-busting bombs. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=17.84s)]
*  The idea of, as you say, confirmed [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=20.36s)]
*  that that was the target. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  They say that they had intelligence [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  that there was a Hamas command and control center underneath [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=26.64s)]
*  the hospital. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=29.76s)]
*  And although they haven't explicitly come out and said [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  that they were targeting Mohammed Sinwar, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=34.52s)]
*  that is what we are being told. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  They believe that he was under the hospital. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=38.88s)]
*  And Sinwar is a very key figure in Gaza. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=42.52s)]
*  He became the leader of Hamas in Gaza [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=46.88s)]
*  after his brother, Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of October 7, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=49.92s)]
*  was killed by the IDF in Raqqa back in October. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  Mohammed Sinwar sources close to some of the mediation talks [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=57.8s)]
*  say that he was particularly stubborn. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  He's blamed by the Israelis of putting blockers in the way, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  sometimes in progress, for the talks to happen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=69.28s)]
*  And so we wait to see whether or not his death is confirmed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=72.88s)]
*  As you say, Hamas have denied it, but obviously [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=76.52s)]
*  no proof of life. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=79.64s)]
*  The IDF haven't said one way or the other, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  but it will be hard for them to confirm it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=83.4s)]
*  They'll have to rely on things like, perhaps, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=85.68s)]
*  communications intercepts if they do have any human intelligence [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=88.04s)]
*  sources on the ground, because they're not [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  going to get their own boots close [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  to the site of that strike. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSX8rOosbdg&t=94.0s)]
