# War in Gaza: 'At what point can we keep throwing International Humanitarian law out the door?'
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ)
*  James, really good to see you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We often speak when you're either in Gaza or somewhere else in the Middle East, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=2.0s)]
*  trying to get much needed aid to all of the desperate people who need it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=7.0s)]
*  But just on the talk of ceasefire, I mean, our correspondent there laid it out just how difficult this whole process is. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=13.0s)]
*  We're 21 months into this war now, whatever you want to call it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=21.0s)]
*  And frankly, it doesn't feel like we are any closer to reaching the end of this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=27.0s)]
*  No, Yaldir, and it's really problematic too to hear, I mean, to hear this idea that aid flows if there's a ceasefire. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=32.0s)]
*  I mean, the idea that mums and dads and children are being denied the most basics for survival, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=40.0s)]
*  and we are talking the most basics for survival. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=46.0s)]
*  We're talking water, we're talking food, we're talking hygiene kits, we're talking medicines. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=48.0s)]
*  The idea that that is tied to a ceasefire is deeply problematic. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=51.0s)]
*  And under any sense of international law, under any sense of decency for a population under bombardment, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=55.0s)]
*  you know, they need the basics for survival. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=60.0s)]
*  So that should not be held as part of a deal that we're waiting for. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=63.0s)]
*  And every other aspect, of course, we want to see a ceasefire. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=69.0s)]
*  Mums and dads want to promise their children they'll go to bed and wake up. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=72.0s)]
*  Mums in Israel want their sons to go home who are hostages living somewhere. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=76.0s)]
*  It ticks every single box. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=81.0s)]
*  As we saw, Yaldir, just a couple of months ago, you know, humanitarian aid has to do a couple of things. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=83.0s)]
*  It has to go to where people need it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=88.0s)]
*  And you have to look at the evidence to make sure that that aid is ensuring malnutrition drops and access to water increases. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=90.0s)]
*  That's what happened in the ceasefire. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=96.0s)]
*  You know, 400 distribution points. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=97.0s)]
*  That's not what's happening now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=99.0s)]
*  We are now seeing this horrible collision in a child's body of a lack of food, a lack of water. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=101.0s)]
*  And that is a lethal, lethal mix for girls and boys beyond what happens day after day from the sky. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=106.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely horrific. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=111.0s)]
*  Some of the stories that you've told us in the past. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=113.0s)]
*  You were in Gaza about three weeks ago and you told us a story of a young boy who was killed trying to get aid. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=115.0s)]
*  And frankly, this is now a daily occurrence for dozens of people trying to get food. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=124.0s)]
*  I was told by someone you arrive at the aid distribution point early and you risk getting killed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=128.0s)]
*  You arrive late, you risk getting killed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=135.0s)]
*  You arrive on time, you risk getting killed. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=137.0s)]
*  It's extraordinary that we have seen something set up that is worse than anyone's possible scenario. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=140.0s)]
*  And it is making humanitarian aid the access, making it much, much more difficult. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=147.0s)]
*  It's an incredibly dangerous place for children, for anyone to try and seek aid. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=154.0s)]
*  And yeah, there's a lot of times people will say, look, can't the UN do something? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=158.0s)]
*  It seems like it's there to stay. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=162.0s)]
*  Can't the UN do something? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=163.0s)]
*  The simple fact is that firstly, we had a very good system in place and that was, you know, 400 distribution points. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=165.0s)]
*  The other thing is that because this site is alongside a militarised zone, people have to go through a militarised zone. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=171.0s)]
*  If an organisation like UNICEF says, OK, well, we want to try and support and we'll put hygiene kits there or water there or something, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=178.0s)]
*  then you are still pushing people down a militarised zone. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=184.0s)]
*  And the next time there is a mass casualty event, which will be tomorrow or the next day, then we've been a party to that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=187.0s)]
*  So firstly, under no circumstances can we push people into where there are soldiers. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=192.0s)]
*  And of course, on the other side, it's not about, you know, isn't it better than nothing? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=198.0s)]
*  Because it's a false equivalent. There was not nothing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=202.0s)]
*  There was 400 distribution points. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=204.0s)]
*  UNICEF was going door to door. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=206.0s)]
*  So it's a dangerous set up for people on the ground. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=208.0s)]
*  It's horrific, the idea that you are being starved somewhere and then scrambling to survive and shot at. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=211.0s)]
*  And at the same time, it's a terribly dangerous precedent. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=219.0s)]
*  There are other wars around the world where groups will look and go, oh, so we don't need the United Nations. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=221.0s)]
*  We can choose who we give food to. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=227.0s)]
*  That should worry world leaders and member states. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=230.0s)]
*  But too many member states have been unconcerned by grave violations against children in Gaza. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=232.0s)]
*  Talk us through the fact that, you know, you, as you say, were in Gaza. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=237.0s)]
*  Are your aid trucks able to get in? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=242.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is a group, a body newly formed, created by Israel and the United States. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=244.0s)]
*  And you have criticised the process, as have up to 170 other aid agencies. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=254.0s)]
*  But in terms of what you guys are doing currently in Gaza, are you able to get some trucks in? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=260.0s)]
*  Are you still able to have these distribution points? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=265.0s)]
*  So it's a great question. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=267.0s)]
*  So, yes, in part, I was lucky enough, you know, part of my work never leaves you, the sense of seeing wounds of war on girls and boys, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=268.0s)]
*  seeing a little girl talking to her who's paralysed, little Jenna, and her explaining to me in her own voice, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=277.0s)]
*  as she lay there paralysed after an airstrike on her school at seven o'clock in the morning while brushing her teeth, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=284.0s)]
*  lying there watching her friend die. Those images, those sounds will never leave me. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=289.0s)]
*  But, Yadr, I also see distribution points. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=293.0s)]
*  I see grandmothers and mothers with malnourished children getting that therapeutic food from UNICEF. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=296.0s)]
*  And it's that that is an utter inspiration. But we know it's not nearly enough. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=300.0s)]
*  There's no way we are getting enough trucks in. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=305.0s)]
*  Right now, it's around one to five percent of the trucks going in. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=307.0s)]
*  There is enough food on the border of Israel to feed a million people for four months. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=312.0s)]
*  So again, those sitting there, it's just sitting there and these denials. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=317.0s)]
*  You know, we cannot normalize this. We can't normalize this idea that a population is deprived of food. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=321.0s)]
*  Yes, you will hear arguments all the time of looting and a diversion. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=325.0s)]
*  We should talk about those looting very clearly. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=329.0s)]
*  Looting happens when there is mass deprivation. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=332.0s)]
*  And, you know, if a portion of London received nothing apart from bombs for two and a half months and then down a certain street, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=334.0s)]
*  they allowed a few trucks, they would be looting because they'd be people are desperate during the season. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=340.0s)]
*  And this idea that Hamas is weaponizing the aid as well, accessing it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=345.0s)]
*  And as you say, there are accusations from the Israeli side that criminal elements are there as well. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=350.0s)]
*  Can you talk us through that a little bit? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=356.0s)]
*  It's really important. So that aid diversion UNICEF has asked time and again just for the evidence, show us the evidence. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=357.0s)]
*  We're a last mile distributor. And what that means is that we follow the aid, the vaccine into a child's arm, the food into a child's mouth. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=362.0s)]
*  We have third party monitors. This is not the first war zone we've worked in, which has had the lack of law and order. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=369.0s)]
*  At no point have we been shown the evidence. No point. Now, beyond the evidence, there's logic. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=374.0s)]
*  OK, so all this aid diversion from that allegedly from Hamas with no evidence. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=378.0s)]
*  But what about hygiene kits for women? What about tents and shelters? What about oxygen? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=383.0s)]
*  You know, what about incubators? We've got incubators that are on the wrong side of the border. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=387.0s)]
*  And pregnant mums who give birth because they are stressed and giving premature, having premature babies, those children are dying. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=392.0s)]
*  So that's food. But then you look at water. We are at the most critical level we've ever been in terms of water. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=400.0s)]
*  Now, water goes from, you know, from the source to a recipient. There's no middle person. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=406.0s)]
*  So how on earth can there possibly be a justification to have a level of deprivation of water to ensure that every single person in Gaza is below an emergency threshold? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=411.0s)]
*  And what is that then leading to? Because, of course, there have been warnings about diseases and things like meningitis for the longest time. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=421.0s)]
*  The last time we spoke and you just come out of Gaza, you spoke about the issue of water and meningitis, for example. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=427.0s)]
*  Yes, well, it's a really pertinent point, Yalda. So right now, as of today and yesterday, we're seeing very worrying spikes in meningitis. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=434.0s)]
*  Polio is still active in the water system we see in the tests. So they are two very, very lethal diseases that should worry everyone. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=442.0s)]
*  Cholera, we've seen no cholera outbreak. If we see a cholera outbreak, then, you know, the level of child mortality that we see from the skies, from the bombardment can be matched. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=451.0s)]
*  These things are all, again, utterly preventable. You know, the access to food, the access to water is political. It's not logistical. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=460.0s)]
*  And yet, as I talk of this and think of the idea of how many children are at risk, I realise that as we talk nutrition and water, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=468.0s)]
*  still this idea that a girl and boy are killed every single hour since the horrors of October 7, every single hour. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=474.0s)]
*  So in the last seven days, 168 children. The idea that that doesn't have member states up in arms and just saying enough. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=481.0s)]
*  At what point can we keep throwing international humanitarian law out the door? But that's where we are. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=488.0s)]
*  A girl and boy, a mum, an auntie, a dad grieving over that child, as we said, that little 13-year-old boy who I will never forget because his dad was in tears [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=494.0s)]
*  as this boy bravely told his story and his mum furious with his medical evacuation form, knowing that it wasn't worth the paper it was printed on, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=503.0s)]
*  as her little boy, this brave boy, who sat up and held my arm because he wanted to tell his story, that dignity of a 13-year-old. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=510.0s)]
*  Those children are dying as you and I speak. It's utterly pointless and it continues. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=517.0s)]
*  Are you hopeful this is going to come to an end any time soon? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=523.0s)]
*  And what more do you think the international community could have frankly done over the course of the last 20 months, which they haven't done? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=527.0s)]
*  It's a great question. Am I hopeful? As a Palestinian said, we have to be hopeful, but it's not a strategy. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=534.0s)]
*  There is no doubt Palestinians are very, very well aware of politics. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=542.0s)]
*  It's quite depressing and revealing when I've had Palestinians say, look, James, we understand the level of outpouring of support for us around the world, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=546.0s)]
*  but it's still matched by impunity and we know that international humanitarian law doesn't apply to us. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=554.0s)]
*  So Palestinians are no fools when it comes to the perilous position they're in, but there's not a single person you talk to tonight, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=559.0s)]
*  even though they know it seems far away, who would not be holding on. They have nothing else to hold on to because as we know, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=565.0s)]
*  not only does it mean an end to bombardments, it apparently means that aid will only flow if there is a ceasefire. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=571.0s)]
*  So they know that their sustenance, their survival is linked to that as well. What else could member states have done so much? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=577.0s)]
*  You know, UNICEF, we have the benefit of being a frontline organisation. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=585.0s)]
*  We talk to those in power and we have conversations with organisations like yours who clearly care. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=589.0s)]
*  But member states have many tools in their toolkit. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=594.0s)]
*  I think what's important here is that this is not a nice principle to have. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=597.0s)]
*  On a practical level, member states, if they're aware that a fellow member state is committing grave violations against children, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=600.0s)]
*  then they bear a responsibility to uphold international law and to ensure they have no political, diplomatic, financial, military support. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=607.0s)]
*  That hasn't been happening and Palestinians are losing because of that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=614.0s)]
*  And it worries me greatly because international humanitarian law is something for generations that's helped all of us around the world. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=618.0s)]
*  James Elder, really great to have you here in person and not just be talking to you whilst you're dealing with all of this in Gaza. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=625.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teocW3ha6bQ&t=632.0s)]
