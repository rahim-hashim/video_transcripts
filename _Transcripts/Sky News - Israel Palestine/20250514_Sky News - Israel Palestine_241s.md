Video Description: Dozens of people have been killed following Israeli strikes in Gaza, including at hospitals, as a United Nations chief warned action is needed to "prevent genocide".  

On Wednesday morning, Israeli airstrikes hit homes in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, killing at least 53 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Indonesian Hospital said 22 of those who died were children.

The Israeli military refused to comment on the strikes, but had warned local residents to evacuate late on Tuesday night due to Hamas infrastructure in the area, including rocket launchers.

# Many killed as Israel intensifies its war against Hamas in Gaza
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4)
*  Two tiny shrouds lie next to the wrapped bodies of their parents in a Gaza Morgue. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=0.0s)]
*  They were not much older than this war has been long. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=7.0s)]
*  More bodies are put into a truck to be taken for burial, more small corpses among them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=18.0s)]
*  Israel says it was targeting launch sites after three rockets were fired into Israel [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=25.0s)]
*  on Tuesday night. Those rockets were successfully intercepted. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=29.36s)]
*  53 people were killed in the Israeli response, health officials have told us. 22 of them children. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=34.36s)]
*  Mohammed shows the body of his cousin Adam and says that he died alongside his mothers and sisters. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=43.36s)]
*  Everyone knows what this has become for us. It's become the norm, like drinking water, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=52.36s)]
*  hearing someone has been martyred and saying may they rest in peace. We've become numbers. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=56.36s)]
*  It's hard to put into words. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=61.36s)]
*  This was the moment, caught on security cameras, that massive strikes hit the European hospital [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=63.36s)]
*  in Khan Younis just before 6.30 yesterday afternoon. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=68.36s)]
*  Women and children can be clearly seen walking on the road outside just seconds beforehand. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=73.36s)]
*  We've cut out the moment the missile lands on the crowd. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=79.36s)]
*  As the dust clears, people run for cover. There were nine strikes in all. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=85.36s)]
*  Israel says it was targeting Mohammed Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=97.36s)]
*  They haven't confirmed whether they killed him. Hamas said he wasn't there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=103.36s)]
*  The IDF released this video claiming to be the tunnel under the hospital, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=110.36s)]
*  but our investigation has found that this was actually a school 160 metres away. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=115.36s)]
*  This morning, as they cleaned up the debris, two more missiles hit. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=123.36s)]
*  This ward had children on, many suffering from cancer and waiting transfer to be treated in the UAE. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=128.36s)]
*  The water supplied to the intensive care unit is now infected and undrinkable. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=135.36s)]
*  So this is the part of the facility where the kids are currently waiting to be transferred out. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=141.36s)]
*  A British surgeon working at the hospital sent us these videos shortly after the strikes hit. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=149.36s)]
*  So standing outside the operating theatre, you can see the damage behind me. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=155.36s)]
*  It's not even possible to take any cases to theatre. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=159.36s)]
*  It is too dangerous. The theatre has been damaged and the staff, unsurprisingly, have left at the moment to try and seek some safety. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=162.36s)]
*  The United Nations says that Gaza is again on the brink of famine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=174.36s)]
*  Israel has refused to let food, water, fuel and medical supplies in since early March. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=179.36s)]
*  There is growing international disquiet amongst Israel's allies. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=186.36s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron has described it as shameful and the UN is pleading for action. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=190.36s)]
*  For those killed and those whose voices are silenced, what more evidence do you need now? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=197.36s)]
*  Will you act decisively to prevent genocide and to ensure respect for international humanitarian law? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=204.36s)]
*  Or will you say instead that we did all we could? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=214.36s)]
*  Israel has said that it plans to force all 2 million Gazans into a smaller area in the south and then conquer and occupy Gaza. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=219.36s)]
*  They say the massive new offensive will begin when Donald Trump leaves the Middle East. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=228.36s)]
*  That's in two days' time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=234.36s)]
*  Alistair Bunkle, Sky News, in Jerusalem. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjiOUX0dU4&t=236.36s)]
