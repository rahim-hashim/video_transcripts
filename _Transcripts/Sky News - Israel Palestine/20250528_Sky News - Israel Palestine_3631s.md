# Netanyahu says Hamas's Gaza chief Mohammed Sinwar killed
**Sky News - Israel Palestine:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A)
*  Of course speaking in the Israeli Knesset, this is our live pictures. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=0.0s)]
*  He's speaking Hebrew at the moment. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3.68s)]
*  If we can get translation, we'll bring you some of what Prime Minister Netanyahu is saying. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=4.88s)]
*  He has confirmed that the head of Hamas, Mohammed Sinwar, has been eliminated, is the word that's being used. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=9.76s)]
*  It's a strike that's being reported on Gaza earlier this month, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=20.96s)]
*  that perhaps is the moment where Sinwar was killed, the strike, allegedly a huge strike, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  according to reporting from Channel 12 on a tunnel in Khan Yunis. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=33.68s)]
*  This is reporting coming to me here from the Times of Israel that happened on the 13th of May, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=39.04s)]
*  believed to have been the moment. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Let's just pause for a moment because you can see tensions very high in the Israeli Knesset. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  I am honored to invite the head of the opposition... [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=56.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, we don't have Hebrew translation, but we'll get some detail for exactly what has happened there. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=69.04s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, as you can see, sitting there, flanked by his coalition. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=74.4s)]
*  I can see Ben Gavir, his security minister, also sitting there in the Knesset, listening to Prime Minister Netanyahu speak. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=79.92s)]
*  I'm very pleased to say that we can go to the Middle East now and bring in our Middle East correspondent, Alistair Bunkle, for the very latest on this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=89.36s)]
*  Ali, as we're watching these pictures of tempers seriously fraying in the Knesset, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=97.2s)]
*  I wonder if you can give us an idea, if you have any detail of the reporting as to exactly what happened just then [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  and what Prime Minister Netanyahu has said as we see our former PM Yair Lapid taking to the elector and addressing the members there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=107.36s)]
*  Well, you'll see the yellow sticker on his chest with the number 600 on it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=117.76s)]
*  Today is the 600th day since October the 7th, so emotions are running pretty high, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=124.4s)]
*  particularly amongst the hostage families. 58 hostages still being held inside Gaza, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=131.6s)]
*  at least 20, possibly 23 of them thought to still be alive. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=138.0s)]
*  And I suspect, I haven't got it confirmed, I suspect what we saw was someone from the hostage families or the group that represents the hostage families, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=142.72s)]
*  that there are multiple groups protesting against the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  and arguing for him to do a ceasefire deal to get the hostages out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  It's not uncommon here to see sessions in the Knesset or other parliamentary committee sessions interrupted by protesters [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  who are angry at the way the Israeli government are conducting the war in Gaza and angry that a new deal has not been agreed to free those hostages. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=177.84s)]
*  So I suspect that was what that was all about. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=188.48s)]
*  But the reports that coming from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Mohamed Sinwar has been killed. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=192.64s)]
*  Now the IDF carried out massive series of airstrikes on the European hospital in Gaza a couple of weeks ago. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=200.24s)]
*  They believed that they had intelligence that Mohamed Sinwar was in the tunnels underneath that hospital [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=208.32s)]
*  and they think that that was a moment that he wasn't close to any of the hostages. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=215.92s)]
*  And so they took that opportunity to carry out a huge series of airstrikes, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=220.24s)]
*  but there had been no confirmation whether or not they had got Mohamed Sinwar. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=226.08s)]
*  Obviously getting kind of any confirmation is pretty difficult because they cannot get IDF soldiers to the scene. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=230.72s)]
*  And so they, I'm speculating here, would have had to have relied on things possibly like communications intercepts [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  to try and determine whether or not Hamas communications were indicating that Sinwar was dead. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  Now if what Benjamin Netanyahu has said is accurate, the only reason I caveat that is because there's been [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=253.6s)]
*  no official release from the Prime Minister's office, no official statement from the Israeli military. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=261.6s)]
*  But if Mohamed Sinwar has been killed by the IDF, then you know that is very significant. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=267.44s)]
*  Mohamed Sinwar was the brother of Yahya Sinwar. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=272.4s)]
*  Yahya Sinwar killed at the end of, towards the end of last year. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=276.08s)]
*  He was the leader of Hamas. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=280.08s)]
*  He was the mastermind behind October 7th, and he was succeeded as the leader of Hamas in Gaza, at least, by his brother. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=282.48s)]
*  His brother's, you know, he was never quite the figure that Yahya was, but you know, he became the senior figure for Hamas in Gaza over the last six or seven months. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=292.24s)]
*  He would have been the point man, the main kind of decision maker for Hamas within Gaza when it came to any ceasefire negotiations. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  It was said that he was pretty stubborn. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  There were reports that often it was Mohamed Sinwar who would put in sort of late demands or try to change the terms of any ceasefire agreement. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=316.56s)]
*  And so the hope has been here, at least, that if Mohamed Sinwar was eliminated, then not only would it further degrade Hamas' command structure, which already is in absolute tatters, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=326.0s)]
*  but it also might remove an individual who had blocked some of the negotiations to try and reach a truce. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=338.8s)]
*  So we'll see whether or not that materializes. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=347.44s)]
*  There are lots of rumors around at the moment about a potential ceasefire being close. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=350.56s)]
*  I have to say every time it seems as though there might have been movement in that direction, that it hasn't actually gone anywhere. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  It tends to be the Israelis, but also actually, in fairness, backed by the Americans saying that Hamas are not agreeing to the deal that is on the table. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=362.88s)]
*  But the elimination of Mohamed Sinwar would be another success for the Israeli military as they're looking to not just decapitate the Hamas leadership, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=372.08s)]
*  but completely dismantle Hamas' ability to operate and function as a military force within Gaza, and also as a political force within Gaza. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=382.16s)]
*  All right, Ali, for now in Jerusalem, thank you for that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=392.8s)]
*  Well, our security and defence and this Professor Michael Clarke is here with us. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=396.16s)]
*  Professor Clarke, great to have you with us on this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=399.52s)]
*  I mean, Ali's final point there, I think it is really important to linger on. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=401.52s)]
*  It's not only that one of the war aims for Benjamin Netanyahu was to destroy Hamas militarily, but also destroy them politically. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  And if it is confirmed that Mohamed Sinwar has been killed, that will be just the latest of leadership killed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  Let's not forget Yahya Sinwar's brother was killed back in October. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=418.79999999999995s)]
*  Mohamed Daif was killed as well. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=421.84s)]
*  Ismail Haniyeh was also killed. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=423.2s)]
*  So it would appear as if many of the top-level leaders now from Hamas have been killed by the Israelis. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they got the top three. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=430.44s)]
*  Haniyeh, who was in Doha, Yahya Sinwar, who was the political leader in Gaza, and Mohamed Deif, who was the military leader. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=431.88s)]
*  So they got those three. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=439.48s)]
*  Then it devolved naturally on Mohamed Sinwar, the younger brother. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=440.68s)]
*  And as Ali said, I mean, not as prominent, different sort of character, though the Israelis have been after him for a long time, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=444.68s)]
*  and they'd imprisoned him in the past and released him and so on. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=449.8s)]
*  He was always a dead man walking, and they know that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=452.92s)]
*  The Israelis said a couple of weeks ago, when they bombed the European hospital with a lot of, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=457.56s)]
*  I can't remember off the top of my head how many civilian casualties, but it was a lot, that they thought they'd got him. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=461.72s)]
*  Because if they're going for one of the top leaders, then they stop calculating how many civilian casualties may be involved. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=466.6s)]
*  They do actually have a sort of tariff for the civilian casualties they would regard as acceptable, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  depending on the Hamas person they're going for. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=478.12s)]
*  When it comes to one of the top leaders, there seems to be no tariff. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=480.36s)]
*  They just go for them where they think they've got them. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=482.92s)]
*  Because they're making the point that they are dismantling Hamas from the top down, and they can argue that they've done that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=485.24s)]
*  In reality, I mean, they've destroyed Hamas as a military organisation about a year ago, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=491.0s)]
*  but they can't destroy it as a political entity, and they can't break its hold, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=495.32000000000005s)]
*  even though it's a hold achieved by terror, over the Palestinians of Gaza, and they just can't seem to do that. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=499.88000000000005s)]
*  The other thing that's interesting about this, I suspect, is the timing of it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=506.92s)]
*  I mean, Netanyahu said two weeks ago, we think we've got him. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=509.96000000000004s)]
*  The fact that they've said now, he confirms it, well, it'll be interesting to see what sort of evidence they've got. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=512.52s)]
*  Maybe they've got some DNA, because that's the most important. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=517.8s)]
*  And sometimes they can get that from agents on the ground, people who are working within the population. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=520.84s)]
*  That's the thing that matters. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=525.16s)]
*  But the fact that he said now is part, I think, or I'm guessing, is the political issue of saying, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=526.68s)]
*  look, our offensive in Gaza is working, our offensive in Gaza is important, we are doing this. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=533.16s)]
*  We are working to destroy Hamas completely, because in Israel itself, the opposition to this new offensive, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  the danger it puts the hostages in, is getting tougher and tougher for the government to live with. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=545.4s)]
*  So the timing of this announcement, it might be coincidence, but if it isn't, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=549.96s)]
*  it's helpful to Netanyahu to be able to say now, oh, yeah, we did get Mohammed Sinemah, we can prove it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=553.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was on the 13th of May when that huge strike on the European capital happened, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=559.96s)]
*  and it was reported that 28 people were killed in that attack and dozens injured. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=564.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, the offensive in Gaza has intensified in recent days and weeks as the Israelis seek to [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=569.1600000000001s)]
*  entirely eliminate Hamas as a fighting force and as a political entity. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=576.44s)]
*  To what level have they been able to achieve that? To what level can they achieve that? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  Because the thing that is always talked about with this, Michael, is that you can kill the leadership, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=586.44s)]
*  you can try and destroy as many of the fighters as you want, but for many people, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=591.0s)]
*  that idea of resistance through Hamas is an ideology and it's almost impossible to destroy that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=594.04s)]
*  And it's not that the Palestinians of Gaza seem incredibly loyal to Hamas, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=598.68s)]
*  it's just that Hamas are in control, they keep control by brutal terror, and I really mean brutal terror, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=602.6s)]
*  anyone who opposes them, anyone who has led these marches in protest at Hamas and what they've [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=608.04s)]
*  brought the Gazans to, they pick up the leaders and they torture them to death and they throw [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=613.64s)]
*  their bodies in front of their families so they can see what happens. I mean, absolutely brutal. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=617.72s)]
*  But the fact is, until the Israelis and or the international community or the community [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=621.48s)]
*  of the Middle East, until they come up with an alternative for the political future of Gaza, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=625.8000000000001s)]
*  then Hamas is the default option and there's nothing that the two million Gazans can really [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=630.76s)]
*  do about that because they're not powerful enough as civilians to take on these wicked terrorists. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=635.48s)]
*  And so that's the biggest issue, or the biggest problem, is that here we are 20 months into this [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=640.28s)]
*  war, the Israelis have been fighting it for 19 months, 20 months since the original atrocity [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=645.4799999999999s)]
*  that Hamas committed, and still there is no credible plan for the day after. There's no [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=649.7199999999999s)]
*  credible plan for a future of Gaza without Hamas. There's a couple of plans that have been floated [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=655.4799999999999s)]
*  and they just disappear because nobody in the Israeli government is really committed to them [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=660.36s)]
*  and the international community doesn't believe that the Israeli government is committed to them, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=665.16s)]
*  so nothing happens. And I've seen the plan, we've all seen the plan come around a couple of times [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=668.4399999999999s)]
*  of a technocratic government elected from local individuals with filtering to keep Hamas people [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=673.88s)]
*  out of it. Yeah it's there on paper but nobody's ever committed to doing anything about it or [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=680.28s)]
*  really trying to make it stick and the people who can pay for that plan, the Gulf Arab states, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=684.4399999999999s)]
*  won't commit themselves until they think the plan is workable. There's another part of the plan [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=689.24s)]
*  within some of these in the Israeli coalition as well to repopulate Gaza with Israelis. Exactly [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=692.6s)]
*  and the military operations going on now is caught between two things, we're all trying to [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=699.32s)]
*  work out what it is. The IDF look as if they're going to conduct a classic counterinsurgency [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=703.56s)]
*  operation so they're going to divide Gaza up into zones, they're going to move the population out of [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=708.5999999999999s)]
*  these zones and then clear Hamas from them, that's what they say they're going to do. There's a sort [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=713.56s)]
*  of counterinsurgency logic to that but a lot in the Israeli government say oh no this is the [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=717.2399999999999s)]
*  reoccupation of Gaza and we'll recolonize it with settlers. That's completely different to what the [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=721.64s)]
*  IDF want. Can the IDF do it? Yes they could but they'll have to stay there in force indefinitely, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=726.68s)]
*  it'll soak up the whole army and the reservists for a long time if they're going to sit on Gaza [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=732.36s)]
*  with two million really distressed and angry people. Absolutely all right Michael for now [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=738.6800000000001s)]
*  appreciate the analysis as always. Let's go back to Ali who's in Jerusalem for us and Ali look [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=742.92s)]
*  from what Michael was saying there, are we any clearer now when if this is fully confirmed [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=747.72s)]
*  that this is a Mohammed Sinwar who was killed as to what that means next for the Israeli offensive [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=754.36s)]
*  within Gaza as the war aim was to destroy Hamas and return the hostages, is there any sense that [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=760.84s)]
*  that will be the end of the destroying of Hamas by killing another leader or will the offensive go on? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=766.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean the offensive will go on so I'm checking my phone for messages from the Israeli military [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=776.0400000000001s)]
*  who are calling right now so I'll see what they have to say when we go to them whether they can [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=783.5600000000001s)]
*  also confirm this news. The offensive will go on at least until such point that there is an agreement [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=787.32s)]
*  reached to come to a ceasefire but you know as I say we wait to see whether Mohammed Sinwar [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=795.6400000000001s)]
*  has been killed, there have been reports as well that he was there with a guy called [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=804.12s)]
*  Mohammed Shabada who is was the commander of the Rafah brigade and probably would have been [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=809.4000000000001s)]
*  Mohammed Sinwar's successor and so if he's dead as well well they've not just taken out the leader [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=820.6s)]
*  but they've probably taken out the next in line and so you know what it is is it's that systematic [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=825.96s)]
*  elimination of all the senior commanders. I think you know if Shabada is dead as well as [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=834.76s)]
*  Mohammed Sinwar then that would leave only one of Hamas's kind of senior military commanders from [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=841.5600000000001s)]
*  October the 7th still alive that's Azadin al-Hadada who is the commander of the Gaza City brigade and [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=849.96s)]
*  my guess would be that he might be next in line to take over from Mohammed Sinwar but you know [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=860.5999999999999s)]
*  the point is is that you know you eliminate these guys one by one and although groups like [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=865.4799999999999s)]
*  Hamas can can regenerate fighters you know with with some sort of relative ease it's much harder [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=873.64s)]
*  to replace senior commanders who have battle experience who have seniority who have respect [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=881.0799999999999s)]
*  within the system that is that is not so easy to do and that is how you can bring about the collapse [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=890.4399999999999s)]
*  of Hamas as a fighting force which you know they are pretty much collapsed even though the IDF is [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=898.12s)]
*  in Gaza in very very large numbers there's very little fighting going on Hamas are still capable [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=905.24s)]
*  of firing the occasional rocket into Israel but very few indeed nobody that I've ever spoken to [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=913.16s)]
*  within the IDF and senior officers within the IDF believes that Hamas is in any way capable of [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=920.6s)]
*  carrying out another October the 7th massacre again but the question for the IDF or at least [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=926.92s)]
*  the task that they've been set by the Israeli government is to ensure that not just that Hamas [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=933.16s)]
*  can't carry out another October the 7th but Hamas cannot fight at all that they are completely [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=940.1999999999999s)]
*  de-armed demilitarized and so that is the task that the IDF is trying to undertake at the moment [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=946.12s)]
*  you know some people question the wisdom of that but yeah the killing of Mohammed Sinwar and perhaps [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=952.52s)]
*  other senior commanders who might have been in that tunnel with him would be a coup for the IDF [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=958.2s)]
*  welcome back let's take you to the United Nations in New York Danny Danan the Israeli [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=964.6s)]
*  representative to the United Nations is speaking let's take a listen [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=968.84s)]
*  ...strength and responsibility even in the face of lies we are facilitating humanitarian aid into Gaza [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=971.8s)]
*  through two mechanisms the existing track crossings in a new system created in coordination with the [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=979.32s)]
*  US and international partners since May 19 almost 9,000 tons of aid have entered Gaza [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=986.52s)]
*  carrying food medical supplies and shelter equipment in the past two weeks four new [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=995.56s)]
*  aid distribution centers were established inside Gaza two of them are already open [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1002.28s)]
*  those centers distribute food packages to thousands of families despite Hamas establishing roadblocks [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1008.9200000000001s)]
*  and checkpoints to prevent civilians from reaching the aid as we speak there are more than 400 trucks [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1016.6s)]
*  already on the Gaza side of the fence waiting to be distributed but the UN has failed to pick them up [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1025.4s)]
*  failed to pick them up we opened the crossings we provided safe routes for those tracks [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1033.8799999999999s)]
*  but the UN did not show up so let me be clear the UN must stop spreading panic and start moving aid [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1040.9199999999998s)]
*  put your ego aside pick up the aid and do your job finally as negotiations for the release of [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1050.68s)]
*  the hostages continue the facts remain Israel accepted the most recent deal Hamas rejected it [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1058.76s)]
*  we will not stop defending our people we will not abandon our hostages who have been held for 600 [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1066.52s)]
*  days now we will not apologize for fighting back against terror thank you [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1074.12s)]
*  Ambassador, hi thank you very much Yvonne Mariachi news you're losing Israel's losing [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1081.1599999999999s)]
*  support amongst European allies your own former Prime Minister has accused Israel of carrying out [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1088.1999999999998s)]
*  war crimes there are hostage families protesting on the streets of Tel Aviv are you feeling the [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1093.32s)]
*  pressure now to stop bombing the people of Gaza? Well we are not bombing the people of Gaza we [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1098.1999999999998s)]
*  are fighting a terrorist organization and as I said very clearly we have two goals in this war [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1102.76s)]
*  we haven't finished the job we will not finish the war leaving behind 58 people [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1108.44s)]
*  there are families waiting for them and we are committed to finish this war [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1113.24s)]
*  by making sure the hostages are back and Hamas is out of the game [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1117.16s)]
*  my question is on West Bank you said many times here that Israel is the state of democracy and [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1124.6000000000001s)]
*  rule of law and this is what exactly happened with our Chinese colleague in West Bank last weekend [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1130.6000000000001s)]
*  during the one many people called Jerusalem day his equipment has been damaged and he has been [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1137.08s)]
*  verbally discriminatively abused can you explain a little bit what kind of rule of law is this [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1142.84s)]
*  especially the law enforcement when they saw those kind of things they left? So I cannot relate to [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1150.04s)]
*  what you are showing me but I would appreciate if you send me the information and we were going to [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1156.1999999999998s)]
*  look into this incident but we are a democracy and we are proud of it. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1160.92s)]
*  The question that the police contacts journalists is there? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1164.6000000000001s)]
*  So there's freedom for journalists in Israel and we have seen it all over the years if there was an [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1168.28s)]
*  incident we will look into that. Mr Ambassador, first I'm hearing with the Associated Press can [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1176.3600000000001s)]
*  you talk about what happened yesterday at the Gaza Mediterranean aid site the UN says 47 were wounded [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1181.4s)]
*  apparently by Israeli fire Gaza Health Ministry says 48 wounded one killed what happened yesterday? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1188.36s)]
*  So first let me make it clear we don't run those centers we provide security for the surrounding [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1194.76s)]
*  area as for yesterday was the first day you know there were a few riots it took the American team [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1200.4399999999998s)]
*  some time to take control of the situation but I can say it out loud we didn't shoot anyone over [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1207.4799999999998s)]
*  there there were like reports about helicopters shooting people and those kind of things it [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1213.0s)]
*  didn't happen not even Gordy shot? No not by us not by us. Ambassador, Kristen Salumi from Al Jazeera [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1218.2s)]
*  English one of the speakers we're expecting to hear from at the meeting today is an American [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1225.8s)]
*  surgeon who's been in Gaza and has written and spoken publicly about his experience they are [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1233.08s)]
*  saying that he witnessed children deliberately targeted and shot often in the head during the [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1240.28s)]
*  ceasefire even how would you respond to the allegations that he's raised that Israeli soldiers [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1247.4s)]
*  have been taking the lives deliberately of children there? So I will listen to his words you know I [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1253.88s)]
*  think it's important to bring briefers from both sides we have asked that there will be briefers [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1259.72s)]
*  that will speak about our suffering unfortunately it will not happen today I hope it will be more [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1264.76s)]
*  balanced in the future meetings but I agree with you there is suffering in Gaza but the blame is [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1269.88s)]
*  on the shoulders of Hamas Hamas that started the war and Hamas that is not willing to lay down [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1276.3600000000001s)]
*  their weapons and release the hostages so they will continue to be suffering until Hamas will [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1282.0400000000002s)]
*  understand that they will not stay in Gaza yes please [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1287.72s)]
*  So at this stage we have both tracks you know I'll call it the old one which is the tracks [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1299.88s)]
*  and the UN should move faster and be more helpful on this issue they complain a lot and they should [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1308.8400000000001s)]
*  be more cooperative and at the same time there is the I would call it the US centers but I think [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1314.44s)]
*  the problem is that some people look at it as a competition and I think it shouldn't be the case [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1321.4s)]
*  I think the UN should put their ego aside and cooperate with the new mechanism as well [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1325.56s)]
*  So I think he is responsible for inflaming the situation and I will elaborate on that [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1340.04s)]
*  first he came to the Security Council and used the term genocide that was irresponsible that was [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1345.32s)]
*  not his role no legal claim for that then he continued and blame us for killing 14,000 [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1351.56s)]
*  Palestinian babies which was a lie it didn't happen and only two days ago he put out another [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1357.48s)]
*  provocation saying that there are 10,000 trucks waiting to enter Gaza that's another provocation [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1363.6399999999999s)]
*  you know if you line up 10,000 trucks from the border with Gaza it will actually be a line until [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1369.48s)]
*  the border with Lebanon from where he's bringing those numbers he should be more responsible [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1376.52s)]
*  when he puts out those statements thank you very much [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1381.8s)]
*  Well as you can see Danny Danon there stepping away from the lectern in the United Nations in [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1397.24s)]
*  New York a short news conference there given by Mr Danon as he sorts to explain the amount of [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1401.8s)]
*  aid that he says the Israelis have delivered into Gaza in the past few days claiming that [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1408.1200000000001s)]
*  since the 19th of May 9,000 tons of aid have gone in four distribution sites have been [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1414.1200000000001s)]
*  established and two of which have opened he also claimed that Israel has accepted the most recent [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1419.24s)]
*  ceasefire deal but Hamas had rejected it and when a question was put to him about the [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1425.8s)]
*  intensification of the Israeli offensive in recent days in Gaza he claimed that Israel was [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1432.36s)]
*  not bombing Gaza it was bombing terrorists our middle east correspondent Azda Bunkle was listening [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1439.32s)]
*  into some of that and joins us now live so look Ali we didn't get the whole of that news conference [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1444.84s)]
*  it doesn't seem as if Mr Danon was asked about Mohamed Sinwar that we were reporting just earlier [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1450.04s)]
*  last hour that his death may well have been confirmed but rather talking about the humanitarian [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1457.24s)]
*  situation and the fact that those distribution centers have been set up and that he said that [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1464.04s)]
*  despite the reporting that at least one person was shot and 48 people injured at one of those [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1472.2s)]
*  humanitarian centers Mr Danon's saying that the Israelis did not shoot anyone yesterday [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1477.64s)]
*  well there were gunshots we can hear that in the video the IDF say they were warning shots [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1488.0400000000002s)]
*  fired in the air above the people in order to regain control of of the crowds and certainly [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1493.5600000000002s)]
*  control was regained at some point afterwards and there have been reports from within Gaza and the [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1500.76s)]
*  United Nations actually as well saying that 48 people were injured so there is as is often the [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1508.36s)]
*  case a disagreement there about what it what exactly happened I should say we have not seen [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1516.28s)]
*  um pictures um or a large number of pictures of people wounded from gunfire [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1523.0s)]
*  uh yesterday so I think that's just worth adding to that he was obviously questioned as well about [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1530.2s)]
*  the intensification of Israel's military campaign in Gaza saying that they're targeting Hamas they're [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1535.48s)]
*  not targeting civilians that you know might be the case but we have also seen over the last few weeks [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1542.52s)]
*  very clearly a huge civilian death toll and many wounded as a result of Israeli airstrikes and what [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1549.0s)]
*  we haven't seen or heard from the IDF is proof when they have said that they were targeting [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1558.44s)]
*  Hamas command centers for example they've not issued any evidence to to prove that claim either [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1566.28s)]
*  so again you know a major difference of agreement between Israel the United Nations [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1573.56s)]
*  and some of its allies Mohammed Sinwar the leader of Hamas in Gaza the younger brother of [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1579.96s)]
*  Yahya Sinwar the mastermind of the October 7th attacks widely believed to have been killed [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1587.6399999999999s)]
*  in major airstrikes on the European hospital earlier this month but now it's been confirmed by [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1594.2s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu Israel's prime minister in the Knesset about an hour or so ago we don't know how [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1601.64s)]
*  they have come to that conclusion it could be human intelligence on the ground it could be the [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1607.48s)]
*  intercept of communications from Hamas but would be a significant moment in this war not as [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1610.92s)]
*  significant as when they killed Yahya Sinwar Mohammed Sinwar was not quite that kind of sort of [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1618.92s)]
*  influential figure within Hamas but you know he was a successor as a leader of Hamas and [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1625.0s)]
*  the Israeli military has successfully eliminated most of Hamas's senior military leadership [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1632.8400000000001s)]
*  one by one and this would be another step towards decapitating its command structure [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1640.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay so thank you for that let's now bring in if we can Seth Frantzman who is the [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1645.96s)]
*  Middle East correspondent at the Jerusalem Post Seth thanks so much for joining us I think when [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1654.76s)]
*  we butchered we didn't know that Danny Dannen was going to pop up so we'll talk a little bit about [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1661.0s)]
*  that as well afterwards but my first question really is about the news that we had about 30 [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1664.6s)]
*  40 minutes ago this announcement that Mohammed Sinwar has been eliminated is there expectation [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1670.12s)]
*  do you think soon that there'll be confirmation of that of that killing [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1675.6399999999999s)]
*  yeah I think as much confirmation as possible I mean he was apparently killed in some sort of [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1681.0s)]
*  an underground facility or a bunker so if they can get some sort of DNA or something like that [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1685.32s)]
*  and I think it was widely expected over the last you know week and a half or so that basically [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1690.76s)]
*  left you know week and a half or so that basically you know he had been eliminated [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1695.96s)]
*  and that he was out of the picture now I guess it remains to be seen whether or not you know that [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1701.08s)]
*  creates leverage or some sort of change in which you know the war can be then brought to some sort [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1706.2s)]
*  of conclusion and that was exactly my question earlier to Ali as well Seth and I want to want [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1711.0s)]
*  to get your perspective on that what we heard from Danny Dannen as well just a short time ago he said [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1717.72s)]
*  that you know that the incentive now is still to finish the war by making sure that Hamas and [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1722.12s)]
*  No More are hostages are returned it's the same war aims that have been there since the 7th of [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1727.32s)]
*  October isn't it and I wonder if killing the leadership of Hamas is taking Israel one step [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1732.52s)]
*  closer to saying that they've done the job on on that side of it I mean it seems that when it comes [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1737.9599999999998s)]
*  to the hostage exchanges that have happened in the past the address for that is the Hamas leadership [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1743.1599999999999s)]
*  that lives in Qatar so and that usually has been American pressure from the Trump administration [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1749.16s)]
*  and Steve Witkoff and and deals that have been done there and that seems to be how it's worked so [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1754.76s)]
*  the the ground campaign the military campaign may create pressure may end up taking out leaders [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1760.1200000000001s)]
*  but it has not usually resulted in a lot of hostages being freed through military action [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1765.3200000000002s)]
*  and I think the idea has been very reticent very cautious to go into areas of the central camps in [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1770.44s)]
*  Gaza which is I think where the 58 hostages 20 or so whom are expected to be alive are held so I [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1776.04s)]
*  think that creates a catch-22 in which the military solution is maybe not there to get the hostages [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1783.32s)]
*  out that seems to have been what the last 19 months has shown and this intensification in [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1788.92s)]
*  recent weeks I mean Danny Dannon had that put to him that you know there have been hundreds of [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1794.52s)]
*  civilians that have been killed in recent weeks as this bombing campaign is intensified as the [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1800.2s)]
*  ground offensive has continued I mean what is that doing in terms of returning the hostages I [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1804.12s)]
*  mean it feels like the same questions every time said returning the hostages and and bringing a [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1809.8799999999999s)]
*  war to to an end the the civilian casualties being killed right I mean I don't know much about I [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1813.6399999999999s)]
*  don't know I haven't seen the civilian casualties data the IDF has said that about 800 terrorists [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1820.4399999999998s)]
*  they believe have been eliminated in the last I guess two months or so but again it's a question [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1825.8s)]
*  in terms of the war goals and the war aims because those goals have changed a bit I mean [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1831.0s)]
*  there's the defeat of Hamas the defeat of the military and governance of Hamas getting the [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1835.64s)]
*  hostages home and now there's the question of this new aid mechanism and and trying to maybe [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1840.52s)]
*  replace Hamas or something like that so there's so many different layers that the question of [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1846.04s)]
*  trying to resolve all of them becomes more and more complex I think absolutely and Seth it's 600 [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1851.08s)]
*  days that since the 7th of October which of course is being marked right now I don't know [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1857.72s)]
*  if you saw the footage from the Knesset just a little while ago where it seemed once Prime [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1863.72s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu finished speaking tempers really flared up I don't know if you know [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1868.76s)]
*  any more about exactly what happened at that point and why there seemed to be such anger [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1873.24s)]
*  in the chamber at that time well I don't know I don't know precisely just that but I've seen [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1877.72s)]
*  all over Israel today driving around I mean you know people are trying to commemorate the 600 days [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1883.32s)]
*  I mean this is just an excruciatingly long time for hostage families to wait for their their children [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1888.4399999999998s)]
*  or loved ones to come home and it is now the longest war in Israel's history as I understand [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1894.84s)]
*  it since the 1948 war of independence so that is something that is is not only a long war but I [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1900.12s)]
*  think the long wait for the hostages is tearing the society apart and that's what we're seeing [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1907.0s)]
*  you know people that want to bring them home as soon as possible okay Seth Ransom from [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1911.88s)]
*  a Jerusalem Post I really do appreciate you making the time to speak to us today Seth [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1916.5200000000002s)]

*  19th of May but of course leaving out the fact that up to that point there had been a blockade [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1937.4s)]
*  in Gaza for many many months I mean what do you make of this side this argument being put forward [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1941.64s)]
*  that the aid is getting in Danny Dannen actually said it's the UN that needs to stop spreading [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=1948.3600000000001s)]

*  In Gaza I operated in hospitals without sterility, electricity or anesthetics. Surgeries took place [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2636.68s)]

*  through a sustained military campaign that has willfully violated international humanitarian law. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2697.88s)]
*  Civilians are now dying not just from the constant airstrikes but from acute malnutrition, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2703.88s)]
*  sepsis, exposure and despair. Between my two visits to Gaza, I witnessed a sharp decline [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2709.3199999999997s)]
*  in patients' health driven not just by injury but by worsening hunger and malnutrition that left [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2715.9599999999996s)]

*  And let's not forget this is a man-made catastrophe. It is entirely preventable. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2728.68s)]
*  Participating in it or not, allowing it to happen is a choice. This is a deliberate denial of [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2734.44s)]
*  conditions necessary for life, food, shelter, water and medicine. Preventing genocide means [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2740.2000000000003s)]

*  survival. On March 18th, the ceasefire was violated by Israel. That day, I witnessed the [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2763.56s)]
*  most extreme mass casualty event of my career at Nasser Medical Complex. 221 trauma patients arrived [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2771.08s)]
*  in one morning. 90 were dead on arrival. Nearly half were severely injured children. No health [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2778.2799999999997s)]

*  Hospitals are meant to be sanctuaries. Health care workers and first responders are supposed [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2790.6s)]
*  to be protected. Children are supposed to be protected. In Gaza, these protections are simply [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2795.56s)]
*  gone. Every day, the distinction between combatant and civilian is erased. Most of my patients were [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2801.56s)]
*  pre-teen children, their bodies shattered by explosives and torn by flying metal. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2808.7599999999998s)]
*  Many died. Those who lived often awoke to find their entire families gone. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2815.08s)]
*  Last year, I published in the New York Times a survey of 65 American health care workers who [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2821.72s)]
*  had served in Gaza. 83% of them reported seeing children shot in the head or the chest. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2826.6s)]
*  I personally treated 13 such cases in my two weeks at European Hospital. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2832.9199999999996s)]
*  According to the War Child Alliance, nearly half of Gaza's children are suicidal. They ask why [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2838.12s)]

*  I wonder if any member of this council has ever met a five-year-old child who no longer wants to [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2852.7599999999998s)]
*  live, let alone imagine a society in which so many young children feel this way. And what [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2858.68s)]
*  astonishes me is not that some children in Gaza have lost the will to live, but that any still [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2865.0s)]
*  cling to hope. My Palestinian friends, mostly health care workers, no longer speak of resilience [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2870.44s)]
*  or even survival. Parents memorize their children's clothing in case they must identify their remains [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2877.48s)]
*  later. They pray for one piece of bread to give them before they sleep so that their children [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2884.04s)]

*  power to stop it. Mr. President, I am here because I have witnessed what is happening in Gaza with my [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2908.84s)]
*  own eyes, especially to children, and I cannot pretend not to have seen it. You too cannot claim [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2914.92s)]
*  ignorance. I urge the council and especially my own government to act with urgency on these [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2920.6800000000003s)]
*  enforceable measures. One, demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire, including a halt to all arms [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2927.2400000000002s)]
*  transfers to all parties to the conflict, alongside targeted and lawful sanctions on Israel. Two, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2934.28s)]
*  demand the reopening of all of Gaza's crossings and guarantee unrestricted medical evacuations, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2941.7999999999997s)]
*  including to hospitals in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where Palestinian patients can be [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2947.64s)]
*  treated by Palestinian doctors with safe return to Gaza assured. Three, guarantee sustained [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2952.92s)]
*  humanitarian access throughout Gaza, allowing all essential supplies, shelter, food, water, fuel, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2960.12s)]
*  and medical supplies to reach all people in need. Four, strongly and explicitly reject [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2967.48s)]
*  the weaponization and politicization of aid embodied by the Gaza humanitarian foundation, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2974.6s)]
*  whose executive director, a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, publicly resigned on Sunday, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2980.68s)]
*  citing the foundation's lack of adherence to humanitarian principles. We must affirm support [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2986.68s)]
*  for existing UN mechanisms, back UNRWA, and ensure NGOs with expertise in reaching and providing [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2992.28s)]
*  specialized care to those in need have unimpeded full access. Five, the immediate and unconditional [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=2999.7200000000003s)]
*  release of all hostages. Six, the immediate and unconditional release of all health care workers, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3008.44s)]
*  including Dr. Hussam Abu Sufiyah, now held in Israeli detention for more than 150 days. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3015.8s)]
*  And seven, without delay, uphold the UN Charter and act now to prevent genocide. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3022.92s)]
*  One day, Gaza survivors may have a record of the empty promises made by the members of this council [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3029.48s)]
*  as their wounds deepened and their lives were lost. If this council remains silent and fails [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3036.2000000000003s)]
*  to act now, that record will stand as a testament to a global failure to provide urgent care and to [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3041.96s)]
*  the collapse of our collective conscience. I'm pleading with you to do what you were entrusted [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3049.08s)]
*  to do, to protect international peace and security and to prevent irreversible harm. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3054.7599999999998s)]
*  The steps I mentioned are the very least that is needed. I'm asking my own government's representative [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3061.4s)]
*  to hear the voices of the majority of Americans who are calling for the same. If this continues, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3067.16s)]
*  there will be no Palestinian doctors left, no one to care for the sick and wounded. There will [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3073.64s)]
*  be no Palestinians left to rebuild the health care system. We are losing a generation before our eyes, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3079.0s)]
*  condemning people to die of hunger, disease, and despair, deaths that could be easily prevented. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3085.4s)]
*  Thank you. I thank Dr. Shitman for his briefing. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3092.12s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. And I now give the floor to those council members who wish to make [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3097.8s)]
*  statements. And I give the floor to the representative of the United States. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3102.2s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Coordinator Cog and Dr. Sidwa, for your briefings. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3109.2400000000002s)]
*  First, let me express condolences on the tragic murders of Israeli embassy officials, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3118.6s)]
*  Yaron Lechinsky and Sarah Milgram, an American citizen, at a Jewish community event last week [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3124.2s)]
*  in Washington. Yaron and Sarah were murdered for no other reason than the assailant wanted to kill [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3131.24s)]
*  Jews. It is horrific and shameful. We can and must do better to combat the sickening rise of [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3139.3999999999996s)]
*  anti-Semitism around the world. May their memories be a blessing. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3148.2s)]
*  I think it's worth noting Yaron's final post before his murder on the social media platform [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3155.08s)]
*  X addressed anti-Semitism at the UN. Specifically, it condemned Undersecretary General for [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3162.7599999999998s)]
*  Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher for spreading anti-Semitic lies. When he addressed this council [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3171.16s)]
*  on May 13th, Undersecretary General Fletcher used language invoking the charge of genocide [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3178.52s)]
*  against Israel. Last week, he claimed that 14,000 babies were about to die within 48 hours, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3184.52s)]
*  an abject falsehood. These kinds of remarks are absolutely unacceptable for an official in his [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3193.08s)]
*  position. Last week, Yaron and Sarah were murdered simply for attending an event for young Jews. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3200.2s)]
*  The irony? The event discussed finding ways to bring aid to Gaza, but that didn't matter. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3209.3999999999996s)]
*  They were targeted because of who they were. The United States has been working tirelessly [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3218.04s)]
*  to free the hostages and bring this war to an end, one that Hamas brutally started. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3223.7999999999997s)]
*  Yet in the most delicate of moments, some member states remain unwilling to condemn the terror [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3230.9199999999996s)]
*  group responsible. Forget that these actions endanger hostages. The actual outcome is condemning [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3236.9199999999996s)]
*  civilians in Gaza to remain under Hamas's control for another generation. For our part, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3244.9199999999996s)]
*  the United States will continue its effort to bring about a diplomatic agreement that will free [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3252.4399999999996s)]
*  the hostages. Hamas continues to reject proposals from the United States, Qatar, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3257.8s)]
*  and Egypt that would release the 58 remaining hostages who have now been cruelly held for 600 [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3264.04s)]
*  days and bring calm to Gaza. Every day, Hamas demonstrates its lack of regard for the Palestinians [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3271.32s)]
*  it claims to represent. All while it violently suppresses protests against its barbaric rule [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3279.5600000000004s)]
*  and diverts aid meant for civilians. The United States fully stands behind Israel and its right [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3286.92s)]
*  to defend itself. In order to move forward, Hamas must be defeated. As Secretary Rubio has said, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3293.7200000000003s)]
*  if an ember survives, it will spark again into a fire. There can be no peaceful and prosperous Gaza [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3302.52s)]
*  as long as Hamas governs it by force. The Council should apply pressure on Hamas to disarm, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3309.64s)]
*  leave, and free Palestinians in Gaza from Hamas's tyranny. Shielding Hamas from accountability [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3318.3599999999997s)]
*  only undermines Israel's security and prolongs Palestinian anguish. Hamas must release the [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3325.48s)]
*  hostages immediately, including the bodies of the four murdered Americans it continues to hold. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3332.76s)]
*  We will not rest until every hostage has been returned from Gaza. Let us be clear, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3349.8s)]
*  this Council should be supporting the work of the negotiators. The United States supports [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3357.08s)]
*  getting assistance to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not allow Hamas to benefit. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3362.68s)]
*  We support the new initiative to resume the flow of aid through pre-existing mechanisms [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3368.68s)]
*  in advance of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's mechanism becoming fully operational. The Gaza [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3373.7999999999997s)]
*  Humanitarian Foundation is an independent entity established to provide a secure mechanism for the [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3381.3199999999997s)]
*  delivery of aid directly to those in need. We call on the UN to work with the Gaza Humanitarian [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3386.4399999999996s)]
*  Foundation and Israel to reach agreements on how to operationalize this system in a way that works [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3392.6s)]
*  for all. One that provides the opportunity to deliver aid directly to civilians without diversion [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3398.68s)]
*  by Hamas and other terrorist and criminal groups. The United States will support a future [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3405.56s)]
*  for the people of Gaza that is free of Hamas and full of opportunity. As President Trump emphasized [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3412.12s)]
*  during his recent visit, before our eyes a new generation of leaders is transcending the ancient [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3420.04s)]
*  conflict's entire divisions of the past and forging a future where the Middle East is defined by [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3426.12s)]
*  commerce, not chaos. Where it exports technology, not terrorism. And where people of different [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3432.76s)]
*  nations, religions, and creeds are building cities together. The United States will do its part to [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3439.6400000000003s)]
*  help forge this new reality alongside Israel and our Arab partners. But at the same time, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3445.96s)]
*  the United States stands with Israel in unequivocally rejecting any effort to unilaterally [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3453.0s)]
*  recognize a Palestinian state or impose conditions on Israel which would be unconscionable, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3459.08s)]
*  which would be, I'm sorry, an unconscionable reward for the heinous Hamas attack on Israel that [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3466.04s)]
*  massacred and brutally kidnapped Israelis and Americans. Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3471.56s)]
*  I thank the representative of the United States for his statement [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3478.2s)]
*  and now give the floor to the permanent representative of Algeria. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3481.4s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3484.84s)]
*  At the outset, I would like to thank Ms. Sigrid Skagg [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3494.28s)]
*  and Dr. Feroz Sidwan for their statement. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3503.8s)]
*  Okay, we're going to step away from a moment from the UN Security Council. We've heard from the [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3510.76s)]
*  US representative to the United Nations saying that the United States stands firmly behind Israel. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3515.0800000000004s)]
*  And this was the end of his statement. They're saying that the United States will not recognize [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3521.7200000000003s)]
*  a Palestinian state, as they would see that as a reward for the Hamas attacks on the 7th of October. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3525.6400000000003s)]
*  We also heard from Dr. Feroz Sidwan, a trauma surgeon who's been working in Gaza, who said [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3531.2400000000002s)]
*  he's a witness to the destruction of the healthcare system there, a systematic destruction, he said, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3537.4s)]
*  dismantled by the Israeli campaign. He made a plea to those in the Security Council to protect [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3542.2000000000003s)]
*  international law, peace and security and bring an end to the war in Gaza. And the first person [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3548.84s)]
*  we heard from was Sigrid Skagg. She is the special coordinator for the Middle East peace process. And [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3554.52s)]
*  her statement outlined exactly what the UN was trying to do to bring about peace in the region. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3563.4s)]
*  She called for an aid, for aids to be given to all civilians, saying that Gazans cannot wait. She [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3570.44s)]
*  said that forced displacement in Gaza must come to an end and there must be the unconditional release [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3576.7599999999998s)]
*  of the hostages and a return of the remains of those who've been killed by Hamas to their families. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3582.44s)]
*  Ms. Skagg also said that the aid that's currently being distributed by Israel in Gaza is not enough. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3590.92s)]
*  She said it's a lifeboat at a time when there has been a flood. She said that civilians in Gaza now [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3598.6s)]
*  say rather than see you tomorrow, see you in hell. She said the only way to bring this to an end was [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3604.92s)]
*  to get back on the path to a two-state solution, that Israel must stop attacks on civilians. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3612.36s)]
*  All right, we'll keep an eye on what's happening in the Security Council of Kosovo out [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3621.88s)]
*  the afternoon here on Sky News today. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UF7ylavA0A&t=3627.88s)]
