Video Description: A US mom is almost a millionaire after a video of her admitting to racially abusing a child went viral. 

Shiloh Hendrix was caught on camera continuing to use the N word after directing  it towards a five-year-old boy she says stole from her child. She is now running a fundraising campaign on the website GiveSendGo, which has so far amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars. And on the same website there’s another high-profile campaign for Karmelo Anthony, the black teenager charged with stabbing a white boy to death at a school track meeting in April.

Liberals are saying Hendrix’s campaign is a sign the post-BLM backlash and the crushing of DEI has provided a fig leaf for outright bigotry. But Conservatives are similarly enraged by the support for Anthony; an alleged murderer who has been glorified by some as a victim of a racist system.

Piers Morgan is shocked to find that one of his guests - cultural commentator Lilly Gaddis - is not only supportive of Hendrix’s campaign but openly admits to using the N word on a regular basis and that she’s an ‘unashamed racist’. Alongside her on the Uncensored panel is New York Post columnist Rikki Schlott, podcaster and author Myron Gaines and author and activist Marc Lamont-Hill.

Then, in a tense and hard-hitting interview, Piers is joined by Jacob Wells, the founder of GiveSendGo.

Editor's Note: We chose to dip the sound for each use of the n-word to avoid causing unnecessary offence to anybody who wasn't expecting it.

# “I Care About Freedom Of Speech!” Piers Morgan vs ‘Racist’ | Shiloh Hendrix & Karmelo Anthony
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw)
*  The way things are going, you're going to make a millionaire out of a woman who racially abused a child. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=0.0s)]
*  Did you call the child a f***ing b***h? It is my own business. You call him a b***h. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=5.36s)]
*  What you're advocating for it seems is that for the rest of Shiloh's life, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=9.92s)]
*  she should be cancelled in silence rather than try to bring some redemption into the situation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=14.4s)]
*  If you call black people the n-word and racially abuse them, unfortunately yes, it has consequences. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=19.36s)]
*  Everyone's flipping out over Shiloh Hendrix and saying the n-word. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=24.48s)]
*  Nobody flipped out like this when the United States was getting destroyed in 2020 because [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=27.68s)]
*  of black protests destroying every liberal city in America. So I don't want to hear it about, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  oh this chameleon for a hundred thousand dollars can say the n-word. Who cares? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  I want to live in a country where people are allowed to say what they want [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  unashamedly and you can you will not have... Well go on then say it. Say the n-word. Go on. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=43.2s)]
*  No no no no. I don't want you to invite this woman to say a racially harmful term to me. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=47.2s)]
*  So if she says it, I'm the victim of it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=51.6s)]
*  Two recent stories in the US have laid bare the shocking levels of racial division in American [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=53.76s)]
*  society amplified by extreme and viral takes on social media. 17-year-old Carmelo Anthony is a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=59.28s)]
*  black teenager charged with stabbing a white boy to death at a school track meeting in April. More [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=66.32s)]
*  than $600,000 in donations have poured in not for the victim's grieving family but for his alleged [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=72.08s)]
*  killer. Last week Shiloh Hendricks went viral after a video showed the young mother racially [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=79.92s)]
*  abusing a five-year-old allegedly for stealing from her young child. Did you call the child [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=85.92s)]
*  it is my own business you call him okay why don't you have the ball to say it right now again [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  all right that's what you say [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=105.68s)]
*  oh shit nobody dig into your shit a little fucking kid just dig you dumbass that little kid you call [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=109.68s)]
*  him the little child are you about to hit him you chase him here he took my son's stuff so you so [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  that gives you the right to call the child five-year-old well as you can see Hendricks [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=123.68s)]
*  doesn't deny using the slur in fact she repeats it many times that's all the stuff is bleeped out [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  when a bystander in the park follows her with his smartphone Hendricks set up a fundraiser on the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=133.68s)]
*  same website as Carmelo Anthony's supporters on which she wrote i called the kid out for what he [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=138.48s)]
*  was incredibly that campaign has now raised more money than the first one surpassing $655,000 [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=143.76s)]
*  at the time of taping the show well the boss of the website give send go is accused of facilitating [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  brazen racism on a platform whose motto his money is temporary jesus is eternal he will join me later [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  liberals say this is exactly what they'd be warning about that the post blm backlash [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=165.04s)]
*  the crushing of dei has provided a thick leaf for outright bigotry conservatives were similarly [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  outraged by the support for Carmelo Anthony an alleged murderer who's been glorified by some as [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=175.04s)]
*  a victim of a racist system we're here to debate all this is the host of the fresh and fit podcast [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=180.48s)]
*  Myron Gaines the host of night school on youtube mark Lamont hill Lily Gaddis a social media [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  commentator whose video defense of the n-word mother has so far been viewed millions of times [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=190.64s)]
*  on x and the new york post columnist and author Ricky Schlott well welcome to all of you um Ricky [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=195.6s)]
*  look my take on this is a stain on all their houses right i just don't know what is happening to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=202.32s)]
*  society when you have such vast sums of money being raised for what seems to me to be deliberate [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=208.16s)]
*  racially charged motivational reasons [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=218.48s)]
*  yeah absolutely i mean we're fighting ugly with ugly right now and i think this level of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=224.0s)]
*  racial tribalism and hostility is just simply not sustainable in such a diverse democracy like [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=228.48s)]
*  america i think it's um you know one is really a reaction to the other i think both campaigns [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=235.12s)]
*  are really hideous and i think we're showing our ugliest colors i mean in the scheme of things these [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=239.83999999999997s)]
*  are small sums relative to the population of america but you you do see i think a really [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=244.56s)]
*  tremendous explosion of ugliness and racial hostility that i think that we should all be [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=250.32s)]
*  ashamed and embarrassed of yeah i mean you described it i think in one of your posts [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=254.8s)]
*  is genuinely this is a siop this would be the best million dollars invested by foreign adversary [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=258.16s)]
*  to start a race war in america i knew exactly what you were what you're getting at because [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=263.44s)]
*  many of the comments i think the comments have now been suspended actually on both of these [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=268.32s)]
*  funding pages because people were quite obviously deliberately misusing them to both to post race [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  baiting commentary absolutely i mean if you go through some of the comments on either of them [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=280.88000000000005s)]
*  you you have white lives matter on one side and uh like suggestions that the the teenage boy who [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=287.6s)]
*  was stabbed was somehow a like a manifestation of white supremacy and it seems to be just a [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  fight at a track meet that has nothing to do with racial hostility in the first place and the poor [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  father of this this young man who died too said please don't make this into a racial issue and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=303.52s)]
*  yet on his own give send go campaign there are comments after comment saying this is white lives [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=308.96s)]
*  matter we're avenging against carmelo anthony's family i mean on on all ends this is this is ugly [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=314.79999999999995s)]
*  i think that it's it's really co-opting um the the charity and giving community i mean i i feel bad [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=319.84s)]
*  for um the the fundraising platforms because i don't think this was the the intention originally [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=326.48s)]
*  um but unfortunately i think that people are really starting to take over um good intents and and the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=332.56s)]
*  the charity industrial complex to make it into a victim industrial complex and it's really sad to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=338.16s)]
*  see well we're going to have uh one of the founders of the give send go uh site a little later the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=342.48s)]
*  program but martin martin hill you were shaking your head there i mean what's your take on this [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=348.72s)]
*  there there are a couple of things that that were said that i think are really interesting and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=352.4s)]
*  important one there is an outside audience of people who are watching all of this and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=356.56s)]
*  opportunistically using it uh for their own agendas and projects you know i have an investment in [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  believing x so i'm going to jump in the comments of this go fund me etc uh i have an investment [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=368.88s)]
*  in why i'm going to do the same thing but what i don't want to do is compare these two things as [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=373.84s)]
*  if they're opposite sides of the same coin for me the intention of the campaign matters in the case [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  of the this woman who is using the n-word the woman isn't disputing using the n-word the woman [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=385.12s)]
*  isn't disputing being racist and the comments that are being uh left on the site before they were [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=390.24s)]
*  suspended and the the attitudes behind it weren't saying she's being railroaded she's being [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  misrepresented they were simply saying we support racism and i think that's disgusting no matter [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  we support racism and i think that's disgusting no matter who's doing it on the other hand the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=406.08s)]
*  people who are fundraising for carmel and anthony the argument here isn't yeah we did something and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=410.64s)]
*  we don't care like the other woman the argument is we're being uh misrepresented here we're being [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=415.52s)]
*  railroaded this was a self-defense claim this is not an act of violence this is the first degree [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=421.91999999999996s)]
*  murder i'm saying what they're saying this isn't my argument they're saying this is a first degree [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=426.88s)]
*  murder uh claim that is wrong this is actually self-defense and we need the money to make sure [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=430.4s)]
*  that we get a fair trial i think um and so whether you agree with his argument or not i think raising [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=435.2s)]
*  money for a fair trial is different than raising money for a racist i mean i think the common theme [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=441.2s)]
*  between the two and this is not to pass any view about it at this stage although i have strong [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=446.32s)]
*  views about it i guess the common theme is that both of them say that as a result of all the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=451.68s)]
*  publicity they've been doxxed and had all their personal details put everywhere on social media [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=457.76s)]
*  which is of course the modern scourge which which gets involved and as a result they've had death [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=462.8s)]
*  threats and they have security issues and and they have to move home and so on you know i i [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=468.56s)]
*  understand that part of the argument you know when you're at the center of a firestorm in america [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  and you're not used to public attention then the levels of intimidation threats and so on that can [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=479.76s)]
*  come your way can be extremely intimidating if not outright dangerous so it's different really [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=485.2s)]
*  to taking a view about either of the cases to simply say that the commonality is that they both [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=492.56s)]
*  i think have said in defending the amounts that have been raised is well we have to defend ourselves [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=498.4s)]
*  either as you're putting it through the courts but also in his case um the the alleged killer [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=504.08s)]
*  uh that he has also i think had direct threats against him and in the case of the mother using [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=509.2s)]
*  the n-word in that despicable manner she has said she's had a lot of threats too [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=514.48s)]
*  okay my quick response to that would just be let's assume everybody's telling the truth let's assume [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=518.48s)]
*  she's telling the truth and let's assume he's telling the truth if he's telling the truth and [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  he was doing self-defense and he's getting harassed and doxed and of course we already know lies have [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=527.2800000000001s)]
*  been told about his his uh gofundme campaign saying they were spending it on mansions and cars all [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=531.76s)]
*  the kind of racist tropes if that's true he's being mistreated and i think that's it that's a [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=535.76s)]
*  that's a sort of very easy case to make when it comes to her however let's assume she's also telling [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=540.96s)]
*  that she used the word she thinks the kid was acting like one she feels like she has a right to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=547.76s)]
*  use that word against that small baby because of whatever age appropriate thing the kid did [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=551.52s)]
*  if she's telling the truth and she's getting doxed and harassed i don't know if i want to reward her [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=556.64s)]
*  behavior with half a million dollars i don't think she should be doxed i don't think she should be [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=560.88s)]

*  child the n-word and we're talking about black people's bad behavior this is absurd and the [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1518.16s)]
*  idea of fighting fire with fire again is a dishonest argument just to take us back to the point here [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1522.56s)]
*  the people who are supporting carmel and anthony's campaign believe that he was wrongfully charged [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1527.2s)]

*  just ask you that question i think this is a yes or no question correct me if i'm wrong do you think [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1553.0400000000002s)]
*  the woman was wrong to do what she did to that child in that part i don't i don't approve of that [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1557.2800000000002s)]
*  but what i will say is that it's very important to understand the entire context of what led us [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1562.72s)]
*  to this position because again metcalfe and hendrix is a microcosm of a much larger problem earlier [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1567.12s)]

*  then an adult who's filming her doesn't care is is blatantly racist why should someone like that [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1822.5600000000002s)]
*  be allowed to raise any money on your site if as you say you are driven by a christian purpose [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1829.76s)]
*  well that's that's a fascinating question i would almost flip it around it's like if if we tried to [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1838.0s)]
*  create litmus tests for everybody to come on to a platform to use it i pretty much could guarantee [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1843.44s)]
*  nobody would pass the litmus test because the reality of humanity is that we're broken this is [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1849.8400000000001s)]
*  because the reality of humanity is that we're broken this is the whole principle of [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1854.6399999999999s)]
*  jesus in the first place says is that we needed a savior and that's what he came for [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1858.8799999999999s)]
*  you would let anybody onto your platform to raise money for anything is that your position [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1868.0s)]
*  no the position is that there are laws that define what is legal and what isn't legal [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1874.32s)]
*  and we adhere to the laws as the framework for what is and isn't allowed but inciting racial [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1879.84s)]
*  hatred is a crime right inciting racial hate hatred is a crime yeah where you don't think [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1885.6s)]
*  it's a crime in the u.s. yeah it is i i've never seen that as a law on the books and but it is that [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1894.2399999999998s)]
*  was part of the reason i'm not even american and i know it's a law on the books you're not allowed [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1901.84s)]
*  to incite racial hatred or violence against ethnic groups based on their ethnicity what could be a [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1905.36s)]
*  more glaring example than someone on camera calling black people the n-word [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1911.9199999999998s)]
*  violence and and words are two different things and we do make a distinction of that in america [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1919.12s)]
*  they are very clearly different things i don't know of any law i'd be happy for you to inform me [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1926.32s)]
*  with what that law is because i you know i don't know everything i'm happy to admit that but as [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1930.8s)]
*  as i has already been mentioned on the show earlier there are needs that exist outside of the reality [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1936.8799999999999s)]
*  of that moment for for shiloh i don't condone the behavior obviously we didn't see the actual [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1942.3999999999999s)]
*  behavior that was accused in the moment what we saw was the aftermath of a kind of baited moment [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1949.44s)]
*  and she carries on using the n-word to a black person with impunity that's a racist [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1957.1200000000001s)]
*  yeah well she she might have some racial elements i don't know i don't know shiloh [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1964.8s)]
*  some racial element she uses the n-word repeatedly to a black man and she doesn't deny having just [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1969.1200000000001s)]
*  used it to a five-year-old black child i'm not sure what more evidence you need that this person's [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1975.6s)]
*  a racist and my question for you is simply where is that line for you you say it's the law [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1980.64s)]
*  what we should go down if somebody is literally raising hundreds of thousands of dollars [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1986.24s)]
*  to support them because they they were blatantly racist i'm just curious how that fits with your [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1991.2s)]
*  the christian ethos of what of what your science supposed to be about [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=1997.2s)]
*  well it fits actually very well because we can like i started to say we don't operate on a litmus [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2001.76s)]
*  test of your past behaviors as far as the services that you get to provide the moment that you start [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2009.2s)]
*  walking down the narrative that we're not going to provide you electricity water because we don't [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2015.52s)]
*  like you the the the the structural elements the movement of money which is a basic element to [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2021.52s)]
*  society so let me just ask you this so if if someone was being blatantly anti-semitic for [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2027.84s)]
*  example right would you allow them to raise money on your platform to defend themselves [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2034.48s)]
*  over their anti-semitism [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2040.16s)]
*  we we sit in a very interesting position as a platform in trying to navigate the [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2044.3200000000002s)]
*  complexities of these issues so what's the answer though what's the answer you can say things [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2049.36s)]
*  well i'll say historically we've stood on that principle of saying we're going to allow things [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2054.2400000000002s)]
*  that we disagree with okay and we've allowed things that we completely disagree with you [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2058.88s)]
*  allow people to do pro-abortion did you allow pro-abortion fundraising [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2063.84s)]
*  actually there's two caveats to what gives and go as has carved out and one of them is we um we [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2068.56s)]
*  well it's broken into two pieces but it's the protection of children so we say we're going to [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2075.92s)]
*  protect children because they don't have a voice so we're not going to allow fundraising for [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2080.8s)]
*  abortions on give sango and we're not going to allow fundraising for the transition the transition [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2084.8s)]
*  of children okay but what about what about a five-year-old child being what about a five-year-old [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2090.4s)]
*  what about a five-year-old black child being called the n-word [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2095.28s)]
*  what about that where does the protection for that child come in [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2101.52s)]
*  well that's that's their parents responsibility that's like if if uh my child and i have several [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2106.88s)]
*  children if my child was called something bad um i would take my child aside and i would tell them [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2112.4s)]
*  you just said one of the caveats you just said one of the caveats for give sango is the protection [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2117.2000000000003s)]
*  of children you talked about the transitioning process you talked about abortion which is [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2123.36s)]
*  obviously your christian perspective on that and i'm simply saying why doesn't it include [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2128.1600000000003s)]
*  children being racially abused why is that suddenly the parents responsibility not yours as a platform [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2134.2400000000002s)]
*  where you are you are literally in rich you are going to make a miller let me just spread it out [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2140.08s)]
*  to you the way things are going you're going to make a millionaire out of a woman who racially [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2144.32s)]
*  abused a child and if if your caveats are incorrect well hang on well you are [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2149.76s)]
*  no no i'm not because one we're a platform we don't make donations to these campaigns these [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2157.44s)]
*  are individuals that are making donations this person will become a millionaire because of your [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2163.2000000000003s)]
*  platform no it's not because of our platform they could they could send checks and they could send [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2167.0400000000004s)]
*  they could send uh money a million different ways to individuals but they're using your platform [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2174.0s)]
*  and you've already said to me you carve out you carve out things in the because you want to protect [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2179.76s)]
*  children i'm just curious why is racially abusing a child not one of your carve outs [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2184.5600000000004s)]
*  well that the what the campaign is fundraising for so we have to make a distinction between [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2192.2400000000002s)]
*  what happens on give send go and then what happens outside of give send go because we can't police [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2198.96s)]
*  everything that happens outside of give send go all that we can police is what happens on give send [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2204.72s)]
*  go so the the two instances that i gave were about campaigns that if they were created on give send [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2210.72s)]
*  go that we would for those scenarios we would prevent but things that happen outside of give send [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2217.3599999999997s)]
*  go we can't police around so does someone have the right to raise funds for their security for [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2223.9199999999996s)]
*  their protection because they've been doxxed because they've because of a a snapshot moment [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2230.48s)]
*  because everyone has a camera in their pocket and and today we can see the outworking of this [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2235.84s)]
*  three years ago in new york city in in the middle of the city there was an altercation between a [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2241.52s)]
*  woman and another black man over bird watching and dogs and her name was amy cooper and to this day [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2248.0s)]
*  three years later she hasn't been able to find a job she's been because she made a bad mistake [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2254.72s)]
*  saying the wrong thing in a particular moment where she racially abused him racially abused him [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2262.24s)]
*  if you racially abuse people you are made accountable for your actions so for the rest of [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2267.2799999999997s)]
*  your life you're the rest of the rest of your life if you shut up from society if you call black [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2271.7599999999998s)]
*  people the n-word and racially abuse them unfortunately yes it has consequences probably [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2276.3999999999996s)]
*  for your professional life for the rest of your professional life we understand that there are [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2281.28s)]
*  consequences i understand this consequences what i'm saying what i'm saying is what you're what [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2285.44s)]
*  you're advocating for it seems is that for the rest of shiloh's life she should be pushed into [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2290.32s)]
*  the recesses of society and that she should not have a voice that she should be cancelled and [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2296.1600000000003s)]
*  silenced this is what drives people to suicide and and it's this cancel culture mantra that that [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2300.8s)]
*  thinks that the best way forward as a society is to cancel them rather than try to bring some [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2307.76s)]
*  redemption into the situation and for give send go our purpose and our hope is not that we agree [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2313.0400000000004s)]
*  with every single campaign it's why we started a prayer team at give send go we actually call every [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2318.4s)]
*  campaign owner and we pray with them and we actually talk them back from the ideological [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2323.84s)]
*  edges that they find themselves in by saying you know what there's a god that loves you you don't [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2328.6400000000003s)]
*  need to get into this tribal space you need to focus on rebuilding that relationship with him [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2332.8s)]
*  because that's the fabric for a principle here's the floor here's the floor with silo here's the [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2337.92s)]
*  floor with silo hendrix she in her in her message left on the donation site it goes on and on sentence [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2343.6000000000004s)]
*  after sentence playing the victim she never once mentions that she repeatedly used the n-word [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2351.6800000000003s)]
*  it doesn't exist in her description of the victimhood statement she puts out there [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2358.8799999999997s)]
*  so it's incredibly disingenuous because people who read that will not realize if they don't know the [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2364.72s)]
*  story that she racially abused a child and then an adult in a most horrific manner and i'm curious [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2370.7999999999997s)]
*  for you as a company you take i believe tips and donations from each of the donations that come in [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2376.4799999999996s)]
*  is that how the system works the system works on voluntary donations so the only thing that we [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2384.96s)]
*  receive is revenue from the from of the six hundred thousand dollars plus that have now been raised [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2391.6s)]
*  for her how much have you guys made give saying go from that money presumably you know right [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2397.2s)]
*  i actually don't know i i haven't kept track of of uh what the donations to that campaign in [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2405.36s)]
*  particular to give send do you feel comfortable you feel comfortable making money out of that [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2410.8s)]
*  what i feel comfortable doing is last week flying out to detroit michigan michigan and [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2417.52s)]
*  stepping into somebody's brokenness who had a campaign on give saying go because their car [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2423.1200000000003s)]
*  was stolen and another car was in an accident and they found out that their three-year-old [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2427.44s)]
*  had cancer well that's a different story it's a different story completely and it's a completely [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2431.2000000000003s)]
*  different story but it's a very specific what we use the funds from give cycle four the bottom [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2435.76s)]
*  line is you're making i don't know tens of thousands maybe more out of a uh particular part [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2440.0s)]
*  of your site that has been set up by a racist who was proudly racist on camera repeatedly and you [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2447.36s)]
*  say you want to protect children but the reason that she is so infamous is she originally in that [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2454.6400000000003s)]
*  exchange racially abused a child and you might laugh and smirk and smile but i don't find any [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2461.04s)]
*  of that funny you keep jumping yeah i don't think it's i don't think it's funny either you've put me [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2467.84s)]
*  in a position to try to defend shiloh which i don't i have no defense for shiloh i don't defend [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2473.92s)]
*  calling a child something like that what is very evident is that one we don't have video of her [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2479.2799999999997s)]
*  doing any of those things outside of the the post video so where she literally uses the n word [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2485.12s)]
*  repeatedly and she doesn't deny using it against the child in fact she makes it clear she did do [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2491.12s)]
*  it because he was behaving like one she said so i don't know why you're being so mean about it [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2496.4s)]
*  the bottom line is she's obviously a nasty racist she's proud of being a racist she admitted being [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2502.56s)]
*  a racist and we heard her being a racist there is no doubt about what happened what you're trying to [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2508.4s)]
*  do is cast a little bit of doubt if you don't mind me saying because it helps your corporate [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2513.52s)]
*  position which is you're making a ton of money out of a racist so he's going to be a millionaire [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2517.92s)]

*  i want to protect the kids right then you would remove her site immediately once you had established [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2543.28s)]
*  in your own brain that she racially abused a five-year-old which by the way she admits to [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2549.76s)]
*  doing right so you could just do that like that yeah no we could do a lot of things but in the [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2554.88s)]
*  country that we live in there are certain fabric elements that make this america what it is and [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2564.1600000000003s)]
*  they need to be defended so free speech one of them upset feelings free speech free speech [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2571.44s)]
*  free freedom of expression expression really and yet how odd because mr well this i'm mistaken [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2576.64s)]
*  unless i'm mistaken you have now removed the ability to comment and removed all the comments [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2581.92s)]
*  on this particular donation site haven't you where's the free speech rights of those people [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2587.52s)]
*  who commented or are you just a hypocrite no well recognize what free speech is free speech is a [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2592.64s)]
*  prohibition against the government enacting laws to prohibit your your speech you literally just [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2600.64s)]
*  made you just literally just made a speech talking about freedom of expression and free speech but [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2606.3199999999997s)]
*  you have you have removed all the comments from here why are you suppressing and censoring [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2610.64s)]
*  people's right to free speech to comment on these sites we have as a private business the right to [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2616.56s)]
*  operate our business the way that you have the right to suppress free speech i don't dispute it [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2624.7999999999997s)]
*  i'm just i'm just curious why you pretend to be this great defender of free speech [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2628.8s)]
*  when you're literally doing the opposite no what we what we saw very clearly in this situation was [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2632.96s)]
*  a campaign for carmella anthony and on the back of it a campaign for shiloh and they were competing [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2640.88s)]
*  off of each other and they were in a a cycle of vitriolic vitriolic tornado of sorts and we said [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2646.5600000000004s)]
*  we need to put some calming effect on this by removing the back and forth element that's going [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2654.24s)]
*  on in this particular situation it wouldn't necessarily get have happened if these campaigns [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2660.16s)]
*  were completely independent months years apart from each other as a christian again as a christian [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2666.56s)]
*  again as a christian again because i'm told that they give send go site for luigi mangioni who we [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2671.12s)]
*  saw allegedly executing a health care boss in cold blood i don't think as much allegedly about [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2677.84s)]
*  it but we'll let the process take its take its course he's got nearly a million pounds for his [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2684.56s)]
*  defense via your site and you know it's sort of odd isn't it is it not an inconsistency in your [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2689.76s)]
*  christian position on this that on the one hand you want it shows you it really shows your lack [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2694.48s)]
*  of understanding what christian faith actually stands for let me ask you the question on the one hand if you want anything [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2700.08s)]
*  pro-abortion on your site that's a no-no because you're all pro-life and yet on the other hand [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2705.52s)]
*  you're helping a bunch of alleged murderers raise millions do you not see an inconsistency [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2712.0s)]
*  with your christian hat on well it just actually goes to the shallow misconception of christianity [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2718.0s)]
*  that you have and i would i would implore you peers to go after reading the bible for what it says [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2724.64s)]
*  the number one critique of jesus kill is ringing quite loud in my head [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2730.8799999999997s)]
*  the number one critique of jesus by the religious leaders of the day was that he hung around with the [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2736.9599999999996s)]
*  prostitutes the drunkards and the sinners he was the guy that went to the lowliest of low places [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2743.04s)]
*  and he actually shared hope in the midst of the worst places we find ourselves in a very similar [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2748.3199999999997s)]
*  situation and our goal at gifts and go is to share hope to people in the midst and and part of that is [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2753.7599999999998s)]
*  navigating how we do it we have a prayer team that calls people and prays with them actually shows [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2760.24s)]
*  them that they're valuable we we have an initiative like i was mentioning earlier all right but the [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2764.8799999999997s)]
*  bottom line the bottom line now mr wells i appreciate you coming on but the bottom line is [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2768.9599999999996s)]
*  the reality of the situation is if you racially abuse a kid you can become a millionaire on your [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2773.2799999999997s)]
*  site and you won't stop it happening and if you kill somebody or allegedly kill somebody you won't [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2778.72s)]
*  stop that happening either but with your christian hat on if somebody wants to put anything up that's [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2783.2799999999997s)]
*  pro-abortion whoa not having that gov and if you want to put a comment under one of these more [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2787.76s)]
*  contentious sites well your free speech your free speech rule immediately collapses listen i'm sorry [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2793.76s)]
*  pierce if you can't recognize that children don't have a voice and they should be protected what [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2799.76s)]
*  about the voice of this what about the voice of this little five-year-old black kid where was [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2804.4s)]
*  where was his right not to be racially abused he doesn't have a campaign on give send go i would [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2808.7200000000003s)]
*  i would love to see a campaign for him on give send go he doesn't have a campaign on give side [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2813.76s)]
*  all right but but to the deeper question of the other campaigns if you think undermining the [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2818.96s)]
*  presumption of innocence until proving guilty in a court of law is a good position to take well [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2824.88s)]
*  so be it that's why we find ourselves in the mess as a society that we have found ourselves in is [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2830.16s)]
*  because people continue to undermine the principles that are that our country was founded upon for the [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2835.36s)]
*  sake of uh some some type of social outrage which apparently is what seems like you're [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2841.92s)]
*  parroting towards us okay let's let's just assume that the viewers can make their own minds up about [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2848.0s)]
*  who's parroting what here but i appreciate you coming on mr welch thank you very much [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2854.08s)]
*  and thanks pierce okay let's go back to the panel there i mean ricky it seemed to me a lot of [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2858.48s)]
*  inconsistencies in mr welch's position not least the donning of the christian hat when it suits [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2862.64s)]
*  them but then removing it when it doesn't you know i think it's definitely tough to make the [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2868.96s)]
*  call here and there and where to censor i err on the side of of not censoring as much as possible [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2875.92s)]
*  but i i agree with you that the selectivity of of having issues with abortion but not with these [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2880.16s)]
*  campaigns is is certainly a problem um but i i also want to go back to our point before too and [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2884.56s)]
*  make the point that i just i hate this argument that because some people were tribal we should [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2890.08s)]
*  be tribal too and shouldn't we want to live in a society where we say tribalism is is bad in [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2895.36s)]
*  general and negative in general and so therefore we should be erring towards individualism and not [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2901.76s)]
*  fighting tribalism with more tribalism i think that's a net negative i agree uh myron your last [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2906.0s)]
*  words on this okay okay because i never get to respond to my other the thing with tribalism [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2910.96s)]
*  it's it's a natural human instinct like we are literally designed to want to be in communities [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2916.2400000000002s)]
*  and want to be a part of a set of community because it ensures our survival has been that way [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2920.4s)]
*  since beginning of time so the thing is that people are typically going to align with people [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2924.48s)]
*  that share similar features and that's why we have the tribalism we have going on right now [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2928.16s)]
*  so the problem is it's not going to go anywhere i think the problem is that we've had this um [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2932.32s)]
*  penting up for literally decades and this has been a response to it you have people that are coming [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2938.0s)]
*  out and supporting someone who you guys might deem as a terrible racist but i think it's also [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2942.64s)]
*  very important to understand how we got here because we're going to look at the smaller [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2946.88s)]
*  problem we can't look at the bigger problem it's what i said before uncheck systemic uh all right [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2950.48s)]
*  mark i'm on hill your last words on this uh this repeated use of the word i think first of all i [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2955.52s)]
*  want just registered as offensive um particularly someone who doesn't identify as a member of that [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2961.68s)]
*  community and who is not right i think that's incredibly i'm the definition of african american [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2966.0s)]
*  and troublesome and and to as a sudanese american or an outsider uh who's using african american [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2972.88s)]
*  very technical term the same way that elon musk is an african american i think is a bit disingenuous [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2978.88s)]
*  but the bigger issue here i think is is that you know this idea of equating of one side to the [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2982.8s)]
*  other side often lose loses track of this issue of power to use as example when black people stand [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2989.12s)]
*  up and say hey let's build our own stuff hey let's have a black power movement that is not the same [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2994.7200000000003s)]
*  as a white power i'll let you speak uninterrupted let me finish please my sudanese brother um [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=2999.28s)]
*  um so so when a black person says hey let's preserve our culture i have no problem with [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3005.3599999999997s)]
*  italians or irish people or anyone else saying let's preserve our culture but when we don't [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3009.2799999999997s)]
*  talk about ethnicity but actual race and white people say let's preserve whiteness it's an [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3012.88s)]
*  exclusionary practice it's about it's about preserving laws and practices and tactics that [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3016.3199999999997s)]
*  do harm to other people a black power movement was about opening stores and building and building [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3020.4s)]
*  businesses a white power movement was it was a white power besta giga it a white power movement [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3025.04s)]
*  was about something very very very very different a white power movement was a [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3032.08s)]
*  included lynchings and included kookuk's clan etc so let's not pretend that these are opposite sides [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3035.7599999999998s)]
*  of the same coin white people say let's save our country even using language of our country [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3040.08s)]
*  when black people built this thing when you say that you're talking about forcing people out of [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3044.48s)]
*  the country you're talking about laws that discriminate you're talking about doing harm [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3048.56s)]
*  to people let's not pretend these are the same thing just like these gofundme campaigns are not [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3050.8799999999997s)]
*  the same thing i'm okay if everybody gets out of the gofundme industrial complex i'd love that [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3054.48s)]
*  but let's not pretend that supporting someone for a fair trial is the same thing as supporting [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3059.2s)]
*  a file a grown white woman berating and calling the n-word to a five-year-old autistic black child [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3063.6s)]
*  and the fact that everyone in here can't be unanimous in condemning that i totally agree [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3070.48s)]
*  how they're not the same i totally agree i'm going to go to lily gattis and just ask you one more [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3074.64s)]
*  time i mean you've been so unashamedly proud of being a racist today um proud of using the n-word [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3078.3199999999997s)]
*  whenever you feel like it you've had a bit of time to think about this is that how you want people to [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3085.36s)]
*  leave this panel debate we're thinking of you as a disgusting racist i don't really care what people [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3090.8s)]
*  think about me as long as you care about what people think about you you have no power and you [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3097.2000000000003s)]
*  lose your country what i care about is freedom of speech and if you're not allowed to say the most [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3101.0400000000004s)]
*  offensive things in this country you do not have freedom of speech i don't care what anybody says [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3105.36s)]
*  so that's the main crux of this situation that's what i care about with this situation it is [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3109.36s)]
*  we have lived for far too long in a country where you can have your life destroyed and people say oh [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3114.0s)]
*  she doesn't need this money her life's destroyed by the way she'll never be able to get another job [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3118.72s)]
*  she's got children to have to support and i don't want to live in a country where you can say an [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3122.8s)]
*  inappropriate rude thing which by the way black people can say things to white people all the [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzmqnQqlxw&t=3127.04s)]
