Video Description: President Donald Trump has only recently completed his first 100 days back in the White House - and already speculation is rife that he will find a way to stay in power for a third term.

He's been busy unleashing a new wave of tariffs and negotiating hard with both Zelensky and Putin - and despite having enough on his plate in 2025, it hasn't stopped the President from acknowledging that people would like to see him run again in 2028... especially if the best the Democrats can offer is Jasmine Crockett.

So, could Trump run for a third term? And if so, would this be a good thing for America? Joining Piers Morgan to debate this is host of 'Keeping it Real' podcast Jillian Michaels, co-host of the 'Ringer's Higher Learning' podcast Van Lathan, former White House Press Secretary under the Bush Administration, Ari Fleischer and host of 'I Doubt It Podcast' Jesse Dollemore.

*  Trump is just having fun with all of us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=16.56s)]
*  Absolutely he's having fun. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=19.04s)]
*  You know, can you guys give us a Donald Trump fun dictionary so that we know when he's having [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=20.6s)]
*  fun and then we also know when he's serious. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=27.92s)]
*  You guys break it down and let us know when we should freak the hell out. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=31.720000000000002s)]

*  How many videos do you need to see of politicians on the left making the exact same hand gesture [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  and yet nobody's alarm? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  The hypocrisy is bananas here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=55.76s)]
*  The problem with US elections is that they never seem to end. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=60.08s)]
*  A newly minted president waits months to be sworn in and appoints his cabinet while a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=62.64s)]
*  never-ending inquest into the losing side's failures rumbles on for the best part of a [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=66.64s)]
*  year and barely 12 months into the presidency our focus turns to the midterms where the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=70.96s)]
*  victorious president usually loses seats in Congress and faces an uphill battle to get [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=75.96s)]
*  anything much done before the whole cycle repeats itself all over again. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=80.36s)]
*  Well critics of President Trump's rule by wave after wave of executive order say it's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=84.24s)]
*  an attack on hollow constitutional norms but it may be that those norms are simply a terrible [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  way of doing business and never mind re-litigating the 2024 election many in the media are currently [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  obsessing over the 2028 election and whether President Trump may find a way to stay in [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=99.6s)]
*  power for a little longer. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=104.56s)]
*  Do you think that's an appropriate precedent to set even if it wasn't you in this position [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=105.56s)]
*  to see a president serve the people of the country? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=106.56s)]
*  I don't want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it we've [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=107.56s)]
*  got a long time to go we have a long time you know we have almost four years to go and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=122.0s)]
*  that's a long time but despite that so many people are saying you've got to run again [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=128.12s)]
*  they love the job we're doing most importantly they love the job we're doing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=133.24s)]
*  Not that he does say that many people want him to run again as opposed to many people [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=137.72s)]
*  wanting him to build a moat around the White House and send tanks down the mile but his [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=140.88s)]
*  main point is the right one there's plenty to be getting on with right here in 2025 the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=145.48s)]
*  president's about to unleash a new wave of tariffs in what is either Liberation Day or [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=151.32s)]
*  Black Wednesday depending on which colour hat you're wearing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=155.4s)]
*  He's negotiating with Harwood, Zelensky and Putin both of whom got a presidential tongue [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=158.88s)]
*  lashing this weekend over to enter the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=162.76s)]

*  in a ridiculous show of support for waste fraud and abuse all of this should be a much [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  greater interest to everyone than who is running in 2028 and if Democrats do want to focus [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=176.12s)]
*  on the next campaign their main concern should be that Jasmine Crockett is emerging as one [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=180.88s)]
*  of the front runners. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=185.48000000000002s)]

*  him is that he is a hot ass mess honey. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=199.68s)]
*  Now Joyless Jasmine is facing a backlash from an appearance on the Breakfast Club last month [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  in which she criticised Republican Byron Donnells for marrying a white woman. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  We continue to put people into office and that even means some of our skin folk who [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=214.12s)]
*  definitely are not our kinfolk such as Byron Donnells who are going to continue to say [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=219.84s)]
*  that like I mean the fact that you sitting around talking about life was better under [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  Jim Crow like is this because you don't understand history or literally it's because you married [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=228.39999999999998s)]
*  a white woman and so you think that that whitewashed you I'm not really sure like what it is but [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=234.28s)]
*  I need to be married to a white woman under Jim Crow. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=239.2s)]
*  Correct, correct and it's a joy to call him out. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=241.92s)]
*  Well there's a word for that it's called racism and it's certainly not the position any [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=244.76s)]
*  Democrat took on Kamala Harris who has a Jewish husband and two white stepchildren none of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=249.2s)]

*  I don't think Trump will run for a third term although we should waste a lot of time arguing [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=257.84s)]
*  about it but if you did poll Americans and whether they prefer Trump 2028 to Crockett [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=261.59999999999997s)]

*  Well welcome to all of you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  Ari Fleischer let me just start with you if I may. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=287.67999999999995s)]
*  From a purely technical point of view is there any reason that the Constitution cannot be [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=291.28s)]
*  further amended to potentially facilitate a president who wishes to serve more than [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=297.4s)]
*  two terms? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=304.08s)]
*  Pierce I refuse to answer that question and I refuse to answer it because this entire [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=305.08s)]
*  debate is dumb. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=312.52s)]
*  Donald Trump has a way of making his critics take the bait. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=314.24s)]
*  Don't take this bait. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump no matter how his second term goes and I hope it goes well is going to leave [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=319.76s)]
*  the political scene leave the presidency in 2029 on January 20th 2029. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=325.2s)]
*  He will not run for reelection. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=330.6s)]
*  He cannot run for the Constitution for reelection. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=332.48s)]
*  There are other mechanisms you could have the vice president become president and then [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=336.48s)]
*  he could appoint Donald Trump his vice president and then he could step down and Donald Trump [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=341.0s)]
*  could assume the presidency. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  That would be within the Constitution but it's foolish. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  It won't happen. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=350.54s)]
*  This is Trump trolling everybody and just don't fall for it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=351.54s)]
*  Trump does these funny things. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=355.46000000000004s)]
*  Go on to the normal things we should talk about. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=357.72s)]
*  Terrorists and all the other controversies. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=360.56s)]
*  This is not one that even is worth spending time on. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=362.54s)]
*  He's having fun. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  Well we're going to get to the other stuff which I agree is probably more important as [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  I said in the monologue but again look I'm a Brit. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  In Britain I see lots of people you know raging away about this but seemingly forgetting that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=374.44000000000005s)]
*  in the UK there is no term limit for prime ministers. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  You can literally serve for the whole of your natural life if you manage to persuade your [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=384.18s)]
*  party and the country that you're popular enough. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=388.97999999999996s)]
*  So you know Margaret Thatcher has served four terms. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=392.18s)]
*  Tony Blair did three terms and so on. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=395.86s)]
*  There is no term limit. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=397.82s)]
*  Obviously in the US I think my understanding is there's not always been a two term limit. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=399.7s)]
*  So when did that actually come in Ari? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=405.41999999999996s)]
*  Right after Franklin Delano Roosevelt. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=409.86s)]
*  That was a change and the Constitution was amended. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=411.56s)]
*  You could serve more than two terms from 1789 when our Constitution was created right [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=414.06s)]
*  up till after World War II. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=418.66s)]
*  FDR served four terms. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=420.66s)]
*  Constitution was amended. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=423.62s)]
*  You can only be elected two terms. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=424.62s)]
*  That's what the Constitution currently states and that's why this is a non-issue. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=427.9s)]
*  And I can understand people are taking the bait. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=432.74s)]
*  My advice to people is enjoy your day. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=435.28s)]
*  Go on. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=437.74s)]
*  Don't worry about this. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=438.74s)]
*  It will not happen. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  And I say that to the people who absolutely love Donald Trump. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=441.92s)]
*  It will not happen. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=445.42s)]
*  Alright Van Latham are you reassured that it will not happen or when the President of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=447.2s)]
*  the United States says he's thinking about it do you take him seriously? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=452.44s)]
*  Yeah so normally I probably wouldn't because you think about I take him seriously I mean [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=456.12s)]
*  you think about all the things that would have to happen. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=462.54s)]
*  You think about you know the Constitutional Amendment and all of that and you think oh [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=465.16s)]
*  This is just bluster. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=468.46s)]
*  This is just Trump spinning a yarn. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=469.46s)]
*  The only thing is that he didn't want to leave the first time. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=471.94s)]
*  So he was voted out of office in a free and fair election and spent a whole conspiracy [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=477.34s)]
*  to create fake electors and had a bunch of people on at the Capitol which ended up in [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=487.52s)]
*  a very embarrassing and dangerous situation for the American government and he essentially [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=496.46s)]
*  created an entire political movement around a lie trying to subvert an election. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=503.06s)]
*  So I'm not understanding why when I've seen him mobilize in that way that I should just [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=510.74s)]
*  think that he's messing around now. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=517.34s)]
*  I think that if Donald Trump has it in his grasp or his fear of his fear of power to [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=519.62s)]
*  stay on for a third term that he would definitely do it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=526.6600000000001s)]
*  He would definitely do it and the reason why I know that he would definitely do it is because [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=529.86s)]
*  there would be absolutely zero resistance from the rank and file on his side to stop [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=534.96s)]
*  him. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=541.94s)]
*  They would subvert the Constitution or anything else if it meant that that appeased daddy. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=542.94s)]
*  Okay, Jillian Michaels, I mean, again, it's an amendment to the Constitution that was [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=548.5s)]
*  made in the last 80 years. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=555.02s)]
*  There's no logical reason why Trump couldn't move potentially to have it further amended. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=558.54s)]
*  So he could technically try and do that. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=564.98s)]
*  The question is whether he'd be successful. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=567.22s)]
*  Listen, I am of the ilk that we should pay attention to the things he actually does as [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=569.14s)]
*  opposed to the things that he says, because if we were chasing down all of the bluster [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=578.1s)]
*  and all of the craziness, which I think is part of his negotiating strategies to throw [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=583.32s)]
*  the other side off balance, so on and so forth, it would be chaos. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=588.1s)]
*  We've got four years to wait and deal with this problem should it arise and there are [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=592.46s)]
*  a host of other significantly pressing issues I think we should be focused on. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=596.74s)]
*  Piers Morgan on Censored is now proudly independent. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=602.38s)]

*  Now let's get straight to the point. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=614.12s)]
*  Support for today's show comes from a business focused on a critical issue. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=615.9s)]
*  Prosperity, US national debt, is at crisis levels. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=619.18s)]
*  Inflation has made life more expensive for everybody and the stock market is precarious. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=622.9399999999999s)]
*  It's enough to make anyone's financial future feel grim. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=626.66s)]
*  So what is the solution? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=630.0s)]
*  Well, a simple one is to opt out of the chaos and invest in something that's solid and reliable. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=631.0s)]
*  Physical, gold and silver. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=635.82s)]
*  And there's only one name you need to remember, American Heart for Gold. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=637.7800000000001s)]

*  They offer an incredible range of gold and silver bars and coins that can be delivered [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=649.1800000000001s)]
*  directly to your door or they'll help you set them up in a tax advantage gold IRA. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=653.74s)]

*  your first purchase and mention my name, Piers. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=674.24s)]
*  So make the smart move. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=677.6s)]
*  Call 866-692-2474 or text Piers. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=679.28s)]

*  That's 866-692-2474 or text Piers. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=687.24s)]
*  That's 866-692-2574 or text Piers. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=692.64s)]
*  All the details are in the description. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=694.76s)]
*  Now on with the show. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=696.6s)]
*  What do you say problem? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=699.6s)]
*  A lot of people who love Trump might not see it as a problem at all. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=701.72s)]
*  They might think, yeah, great, if he's doing great guns by then, if he delivers on all [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=705.24s)]
*  his promises, why not? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, again, I understand how the constitution is right now to prevent it, but as Ari explained [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=712.96s)]
*  very diligently there, this has only been since the end of World War II. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=719.12s)]
*  It's not like he's been there from the start. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=723.5600000000001s)]
*  So are the new amendments to the constitution less important than the older ones, Piers? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=727.68s)]
*  Sorry, Jesse? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=733.04s)]
*  I said are the newer amendments to our constitution less important than the older ones? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=734.8s)]
*  No, but I guess I would say as a Brit, who's not an American, so let me obviously make [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=739.84s)]
*  that clear. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=744.44s)]
*  My accent probably gives you a clue. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=745.44s)]
*  But I've never understood why there should be such a sacrosanct reliance on the current [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=747.5200000000001s)]
*  constitution, given that so many of the things in it are amendments. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=753.96s)]
*  So if they've already been amended, why couldn't they be amended again? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=759.6400000000001s)]
*  I mean, treat me like a village idiot, Jesse. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=763.2s)]
*  Well, hang on, let Jesse answer. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=764.84s)]
*  But treat me like a British village idiot. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=766.5200000000001s)]
*  If something's already been amended once, actually, why can't it be amended again? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=768.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, it can be. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=774.1600000000001s)]
*  It's a Herculean endeavor to try to get that through. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=776.36s)]
*  But I would challenge your assertion at the very beginning when you said it's a terrible [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=780.84s)]
*  way of doing business to adhere to some loyalty to the constitution. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=785.12s)]
*  It's the basis and foundation for the rule of law in this country, and to ignore it is [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=789.72s)]
*  at folly of the people who will do so. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=795.52s)]
*  Republicans love to hold up their constitutions that they pull out of their pockets that are [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=798.6800000000001s)]
*  nothing but a prop and act as though they have respect for this document. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=801.88s)]
*  When I served in the United States Marine Corps for the years that I did, I raised my [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=805.88s)]
*  right hand and swore an oath to defend and support this document against all enemies, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=810.28s)]
*  foreign and domestic, and that includes Donald Trump. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=814.48s)]
*  We should have a vital respect and adherence to the rule of law in this country, and it's [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=817.32s)]
*  based on the constitution. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=822.88s)]
*  OK. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=824.88s)]
*  Ari, let's move on to… [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=825.88s)]
*  If you were to amend the constitution, it takes two-thirds of the House, two-thirds [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=830.68s)]
*  of the Senate, and three-fifths of the states. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=835.2399999999999s)]
*  So the only way you could amend the constitution to put Trump back in there is if the Democrats [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=837.4799999999999s)]
*  want to do it. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=843.56s)]
*  That's why it will not happen. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=844.88s)]
*  It's a silly debate. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=846.92s)]
*  Trump is just having fun with all of us, and it's just not there. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=848.16s)]
*  Do you assert, Ari, that Donald Trump is lying when he says, I'm not joking, this is what [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=853.9599999999999s)]
*  I want? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=859.04s)]
*  He's a liar? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=860.04s)]
*  Oh, he's having fun. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=861.04s)]
*  Absolutely he's having fun. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=863.24s)]
*  I think he has no intention of serving a third term. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=865.4s)]
*  Let him have a successful second term. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=868.52s)]
*  I'm more worried about that. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=870.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, he nearly had a successful insurrection, so… [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=871.52s)]
*  Yeah, can you guys do us a favor? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=875.68s)]
*  Can you guys give us a Donald Trump fun dictionary so that we know when he's having fun and [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=877.9s)]
*  know when he's serious? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=886.68s)]
*  Because when the president speaks, normally we take it seriously, but you guys seem to [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=888.5999999999999s)]
*  have this ESP with Donald Trump, this psychic connection to where you know when he's joking [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=894.92s)]
*  and then you know when he's being serious. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=903.42s)]
*  So tariffs, Greenland, I need you guys to break it down. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=906.28s)]
*  You guys could be in charge of it. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=910.12s)]
*  You guys break it down and let us know when we should freak the hell out because that [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=911.76s)]
*  seems like something that a dictator would want to do and we don't know when he's joking. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=917.12s)]
*  He's the president. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=922.0s)]
*  So when he says something, we take it as him meaning it. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=923.0s)]
*  Okay, Ari, it's actually a reasonable point. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=927.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's a reasonable point, Ari, isn't it? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=933.72s)]
*  Donald Trump is not like any other president. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=937.4s)]
*  He often does say stuff which he just shoots on the hip or says things to wind up the libs [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=939.56s)]
*  or whatever it may be. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=944.14s)]
*  It's not an unreasonable point Van is making that it ought to be probably easier to try [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=946.1199999999999s)]
*  and process what the president of the United States actually means in any given moment. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=951.38s)]
*  Trump was elected because he's not a politician, because he's not predictable. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=959.76s)]
*  And I do feel sorry for his critics. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=963.52s)]
*  I feel sorry for people who go through every day saying, oh my gosh, Trump did this. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=965.36s)]
*  Trump sneezed that. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=969.9s)]
*  Trump coughed this. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=970.96s)]
*  And they die and they take it seriously. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=972.34s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=975.02s)]
*  Maybe people like me have a decoder ring. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=976.02s)]
*  And so we know when he's saying these things that you just roll your eyes and move on to [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=977.94s)]
*  the next one. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=982.44s)]
*  I do that when he says Q is going to be a fifth of the first date. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=983.44s)]
*  Is the long live the king also part of your decoder ring, Ari Fleischer? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=984.44s)]
*  No, it won't be a fifth of the first date. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=986.4s)]
*  I'm sorry? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=990.0s)]
*  I think this is obvious. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=991.0s)]
*  We should be paying attention to the things that he does. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=992.08s)]
*  I said is the long live the king post from the White House, would this have been something [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=993.08s)]
*  that would have flown in the George W. Bush White House to declare himself a king and [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=997.84s)]
*  also flirt with the idea that he's not joking he wants a third term in violation of the [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1002.06s)]
*  United States Constitution? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1007.48s)]
*  No, this would never happen before. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1010.28s)]
*  But Donald Trump got elected. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1013.8s)]
*  The American people knew what they were doing when they put him there. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1015.08s)]
*  They want somebody who's going to shake things up. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1017.44s)]
*  Part of his shakeup is to say these things. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1020.32s)]
*  And I'm happy to have that decoder ring. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  That's why I was saying Canada is not going to become a 51st state. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1025.3600000000001s)]
*  We're not going to invade Greenland and he won't serve a third term. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1028.8400000000001s)]
*  It's so obvious. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1032.44s)]
*  So he's an unserious, unbelievable person. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1033.44s)]
*  Keep moving. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1036.44s)]
*  All right, Gilly, do you want to jump in? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1037.44s)]
*  I would simply say you can decode it by the actions that he takes as opposed to the things [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1041.88s)]
*  that he says. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1047.48s)]
*  If he makes legal moves to put himself in for a third term, then we can all be alarmed. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1048.92s)]
*  I would be alarmed. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1054.5600000000002s)]
*  If he actually invades Greenland, we can all be extremely alarmed. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1056.04s)]
*  But as far as I can tell, having now lived through his first term, read his book The [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1060.44s)]
*  Art of the Deal, and watching his first hundred days, I think there's 70-something days that [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1065.52s)]
*  have passed so far, it's the same negotiating tactics that he's employed strategically throughout [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1070.68s)]
*  his professional career and his political career. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1077.06s)]
*  So that's your decoder ring. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1079.6599999999999s)]
*  When he takes action to do these things outside of just the words that come out of his mouth, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1080.84s)]
*  then we can all be alarmed about a third term. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1085.82s)]
*  Okay, Ari, let me ask you something. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1088.1799999999998s)]
*  Hang on, don't talk all at once. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1091.1799999999998s)]
*  Wait, wait, don't talk all at once. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1093.22s)]
*  I want to ask Ari a question, which is about tariffs. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1094.22s)]
*  So on the tariffs, Trump seems to be escalating this tariff war now in a pretty radical way. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1098.58s)]
*  We've never seen before. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1106.94s)]
*  It's no longer just reciprocal he's talking about. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1108.5800000000002s)]
*  He's talking about a 25% tariff on all imported cars, but also potentially a sort of global [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1111.3400000000001s)]
*  tariff on pretty much everything. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1117.7s)]
*  Translate this for me. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1120.5800000000002s)]
*  What is Trump's real aim here with this tariff war, do you think? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1121.5800000000002s)]
*  His real aim is to bring manufacturing back to the United States of America, and it's [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1128.6200000000001s)]
*  a huge roll of the dice. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1133.8600000000001s)]
*  Every economic theory says this will be unsuccessful. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1135.96s)]
*  It will result in an expensive trade war in which no one will win. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1138.52s)]
*  Trump believes that the United States will win because we will start to buy products [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1143.0s)]
*  made by Americans. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1147.28s)]
*  There will be more blue collar factory jobs for Americans, and that is what he wants to [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1148.28s)]
*  return to. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1152.96s)]
*  So he doesn't care if a customer is going to buy a Range Rover and the price of the [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1154.26s)]
*  Range Rover is now 25% higher. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1158.28s)]
*  That's his gamble. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1162.0s)]
*  That's his roll of the dice. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1167.56s)]
*  It's a huge risk, but that's what he thinks, and I think it's genuine. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1168.9s)]
*  He wants to return manufacturing to America. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1172.88s)]
*  Okay, Van, essentially what is... [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1175.36s)]
*  Well, hang on, Jesse. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1178.4s)]
*  I'll come to you after Van. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1179.88s)]
*  Van, intrinsically, what is wrong with that ideology? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1182.0s)]
*  If Trump recognizes that American manufacturing has been disappearing rapidly, a lot of jobs [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1186.0s)]
*  and factories outsourcing out to other countries, actually, is he wrong? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1192.64s)]
*  Let's put aside the way he's going about this, which many think is too radical and can't [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1198.64s)]
*  work, but is he wrong in trying to bring manufacturing back in a big way to the United States? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1203.32s)]
*  All right, two things. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1210.0s)]
*  One, I want to respond to Julian real quick. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1212.0s)]
*  So you're right when Trump does something, but remember, we saw Trump try to overturn [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1214.12s)]
*  an election, use nefarious and illegal means to try to overturn an election, right? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1220.52s)]
*  So we've seen him take action to subvert constitutional law and American norms. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1226.1999999999998s)]
*  We've seen him do that. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1232.12s)]
*  That's the first thing. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1233.32s)]
*  So if he's not just... [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1234.32s)]
*  Then he wasn't successful, though. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1235.32s)]
*  He wasn't successful because the system... [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1237.56s)]
*  But not because he didn't try. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1239.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1241.88s)]
*  The system, hell, not because he didn't try. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1242.88s)]
*  And should he try again? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1244.88s)]
*  So secondly, this is what I would say about the tariffs. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1246.88s)]
*  Number one is we would all like to see domestic manufacturing come back to the United States. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1251.24s)]
*  We would all like to see Americans have wage growth and stable jobs. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1257.1200000000001s)]
*  The point that I'm making is, or that a lot of people are making is, is this doesn't work. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1263.48s)]
*  When Trump instituted his tariffs in his first term and he tried to raise prices on foreign [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1267.94s)]
*  goods, do you know what happened? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1275.8200000000002s)]
*  Domestic goods actually went up as well. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1278.5s)]
*  And the reason why they went up as well was because those domestic manufacturers saw demand. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1281.6200000000001s)]
*  They saw the fact that they were now in demand and they rose prices to meet the prices of [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1289.18s)]
*  foreign goods that were also more expensive. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1295.42s)]
*  Of course, it matters the way that you do something because the way that you do something [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1298.8600000000001s)]
*  denotes whether or not that something works or not. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1304.3000000000002s)]
*  Jillian was a fitness expert. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1309.22s)]
*  I like to run. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1311.6200000000001s)]
*  I also like to eat brownies in excess every night around 7 p.m. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1313.14s)]
*  It's not going to work that way, right, Jillian? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1318.74s)]
*  I'm going to break even. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1321.3400000000001s)]
*  So you have to do something in the way that will allow it to be successful. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1322.98s)]
*  And this tariff thing is not going to work. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1330.02s)]
*  And that's not a red hat or a blue hat saying that. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1332.7s)]
*  That's economists who are studying it and looking at it independently. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1335.02s)]
*  OK, Jesse. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1340.5s)]
*  Well, not to mention the fact that even if we were to accept the premise of what Donald [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1342.6200000000001s)]
*  Trump is attempting to do here and what his motivations are, it is a long-tailed endeavor [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1348.74s)]
*  to stand up a manufacturing facility to alter the nature of our economy and how diversified [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1353.82s)]
*  it is. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1361.14s)]
*  It's not something with this magical thinking that conservatives have that all of a sudden [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1362.14s)]
*  you've got an auto manufacturing plant or name another industry. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1365.6200000000001s)]
*  It takes a long time to get that done. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1369.9s)]
*  And by punishing the American people with the tariffs and the price increases, that [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1372.6200000000001s)]
*  are sure to come and have already started, you're not ending your goal. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1377.26s)]
*  All you're doing is creating chaos, which seems to be the order of the day. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1381.66s)]
*  OK, Jillian, the problem it seems to me is that Trump's got to be very careful here, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1385.7s)]
*  that the economy doesn't get sent into a kind of death spiral in the short to middle term [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1389.7s)]
*  while he tries to achieve the longer term goal, which I think is quite an admirable [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1395.82s)]
*  goal actually. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1400.14s)]
*  But it's the fact that in the meantime, if the stock market keeps crashing, if the economy [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1401.46s)]
*  starts to tank, if inflation starts to soar again, he just may not have time to do this [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1406.5s)]
*  in the way that he wants. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1412.74s)]
*  The midterms could end up being a real shellacking for the Republicans if the American people [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1414.5800000000002s)]
*  feel they've been let down and not buying into the long term here. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1419.48s)]
*  So as Ari said, it's a big throw of a dice. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1423.54s)]
*  Without question, it's going to be a fine needle to thread, obviously, and I'm certainly [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1429.18s)]
*  not an economist, but I've interviewed different experts on the subject matter. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1433.6599999999999s)]
*  And here's what I've taken away thus far. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1438.4599999999998s)]
*  And my first question, and correct me if I'm getting this wrong, is didn't Biden keep [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1440.54s)]
*  Trump's tariffs? Because I'm under the impression he did. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1445.1799999999998s)]
*  So please tell me if I've misunderstood that. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1447.3s)]
*  Now, table. OK, so correct. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1450.8999999999999s)]
*  So he kept them. All right. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1454.1399999999999s)]
*  Moving on. Now, if we look at many of the ways that he's utilizing these tariffs, it [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1456.1399999999999s)]
*  seems to me that it's been in large part there's an asymmetry without question. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1461.42s)]
*  And we could go through the asymmetry with Canada, the EU, China, South America, each [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1466.14s)]
*  and every one. And he's obviously utilizing this as a leveraging tool. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1471.66s)]
*  So whether it's getting Venezuela and Colombia to take their criminals back or it's getting [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1477.1000000000001s)]
*  neutrality back at the Panama Canal or whether it's getting different countries around the [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1483.1000000000001s)]
*  world to invest here in America. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1488.3799999999999s)]
*  And again, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I was just told recently by an expert [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1490.8999999999999s)]
*  that there has been 400 trillion now in investments here from other countries like Saudi Arabia, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1496.78s)]
*  the EU, even Canada, looking at bringing the chips from Taiwan over here, Hyundai investing [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1502.74s)]
*  more money and manufacturing over here. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1508.78s)]
*  So I'm not saying it's going to work. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1511.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't know yet. Obviously, it all remains to be seen. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1513.3799999999999s)]
*  But I think the intentions are pretty good. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1517.1s)]
*  We've tried to get a grip on these imbalances for decades now and no one's done it successfully. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1521.2199999999998s)]
*  So, yes, I feel like I'm on a roller coaster and I'm holding on, but I'm hopeful that it's [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1526.78s)]
*  going to work out based on honestly the things I've seen thus far. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1531.74s)]
*  OK, Ari, I know we've only got a few minutes. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1535.4599999999998s)]
*  Well, hang on, Jesse, because we've only got a few minutes left with Ari before he has to [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1537.86s)]
*  leave us, Sandy. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1541.1s)]
*  Ari, just to pivot to what's happening on the foreign stage before you have to go. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1542.46s)]
*  In terms of Ukraine and Russia, some tension creeping in now with Trump making some jungle [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1549.14s)]
*  drum noises about potentially punishing Russia with tariffs. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1555.5s)]
*  He said he could fix this Ukraine war in a day. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1560.0600000000002s)]
*  That clearly was never going to be possible and has proven not to be possible. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1562.42s)]
*  But where do you think we are going with this deal that he's trying to navigate through? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1566.38s)]
*  Well, you know, the expression is it takes two to tango. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1571.94s)]
*  And I think you could add it takes two to untango. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1577.5800000000002s)]
*  And if we're going to be successful in creating peace between Ukraine and Russia, we need [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1580.78s)]
*  to put leverage on both countries, not just Ukraine. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1584.3400000000001s)]
*  So I thought it was welcome to hear the president's tougher tone now against Vladimir Putin. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1587.8600000000001s)]
*  And you have to be very careful with Vladimir Putin. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1592.18s)]
*  He lies. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1594.26s)]
*  He lies regularly. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1595.26s)]
*  He invades his neighbors. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1596.26s)]
*  No matter what you think about how long this war can go on or whether America or Europe [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1598.38s)]
*  should be giving aid to Ukraine, for how long will we give aid to Ukraine? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1602.94s)]
*  If you only put pressure on one party, you're going to encourage the other party to become [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1608.06s)]
*  more aggressive. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1611.3200000000002s)]
*  So I like to hear this new language by President Trump about President Putin. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1612.68s)]
*  I hope we can achieve peace there. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1617.38s)]
*  This doesn't have to be a forever war. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1619.1000000000001s)]
*  But this is welcome, in my opinion, Pierce. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1622.14s)]
*  This is a reflection of the real world and the real Vladimir Putin. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1624.54s)]
*  Are you joking or is he being serious? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1627.74s)]
*  Jesse, Jesse, I will get you to respond to that. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1631.78s)]
*  But I just want to while I still got Ari for a minute, just on Doge and the backlash against [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1634.1399999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk and the attacks on Tesla factories, petrol bombing Tesla cars, attacking people [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1640.54s)]
*  who are driving Teslas. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1647.34s)]
*  What does that say about the Democrats, the liberals, if you like, who for many years [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1649.82s)]
*  had Elon Musk as their hero, the guy that brought green energy into the world and through [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1655.1s)]
*  the cars? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1660.34s)]
*  Not to mention all the arson attacks at Tesla dealers throughout the United States. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1663.46s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1667.62s)]
*  There is a violent left in the United States of America. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1668.62s)]
*  And it really began in 2016 when Donald Trump was running and people at Trump rallies would [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1671.8999999999999s)]
*  get attacked. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1677.74s)]
*  When they had the convention at the White House in 2020, as people left the White House [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1678.96s)]
*  after the Republican convention, they were attacked on the streets of Washington, D.C. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1684.16s)]
*  There is a terrible violence inside the left. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1688.88s)]
*  And you're seeing it now in the Tesla dealerships. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1692.24s)]
*  I'm so glad we have a different new FBI that takes this seriously. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1695.08s)]
*  They arrested already one of these people in Las Vegas who committed these attacks. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1698.16s)]
*  And it's not how Americans should settle. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1703.52s)]
*  It's not how any democracy should settle its differences. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1705.44s)]
*  The differences should be settled peacefully and at the polls. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1708.32s)]
*  But this anti-Trump reaction, anti-Musk reaction, is terrifying for anybody who really believes [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1711.62s)]
*  in democracy. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1718.52s)]
*  There is a threat to democracy in the United States. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1719.78s)]
*  It largely comes from the left, not from Donald Trump or Donald Trump supporters. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1722.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1725.6399999999999s)]
*  Ari, before you go, I just want to say something. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1726.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, go quickly, man. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1729.48s)]
*  Before you go, I want to say something real quick. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1730.96s)]
*  I hope that all of the people that are vandalizing Tesla dealerships everywhere, because I drive [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1733.04s)]
*  a Tesla, bought it in 2018, cool car. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1741.92s)]
*  I'm ashamed now, but I drive one. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1744.56s)]
*  I hope that all of these people are rounded up and caught so that a Democratic president [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1747.3999999999999s)]
*  can pardon them. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1754.04s)]
*  Touche. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1756.1599999999999s)]
*  That's a good argument. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1760.1s)]
*  Well said. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1761.1s)]
*  I know. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1762.1599999999999s)]
*  I know it is. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1763.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty ironclad. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1764.1599999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1765.1599999999999s)]
*  Ari, before you go, thank you very much indeed for coming on on the sensitive. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1766.1599999999999s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1770.1399999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1771.1399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1772.1399999999999s)]
*  Drive safely. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1773.1399999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1774.1399999999999s)]
*  Jesse, I mean, look, we'll come to Ukraine in a moment, but on this, on what's happening [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1775.1399999999999s)]
*  with Tesla, I just find it so ironic that here you have a huge number of people where [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1781.34s)]
*  Elon Musk was the hero, but because politically he slightly changed colors, they are now using [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1786.74s)]
*  violence and really slightly changed colors. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1791.98s)]
*  He's thrown up Nazi salutes. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1796.18s)]
*  He didn't slightly change. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1797.58s)]
*  He didn't throw up a Nazi salute. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1798.58s)]
*  And you know he did. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1800.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1801.06s)]
*  I know he did. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1802.06s)]
*  I'm not a Nazi apologist. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1803.06s)]
*  You do you. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1807.18s)]
*  It was not a Nazi salute. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1808.18s)]
*  Why would he throw a Nazi salute? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1809.18s)]
*  Because he's a white supremacist. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1813.22s)]
*  He's not a white supremacist. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1814.5s)]
*  Why would he campaign for the FD, AFD in Germany? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1818.22s)]
*  Why would he do that? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1821.7199999999998s)]
*  Why would he continue to talk about the great replacement theory and birth rates among white [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1822.7199999999998s)]
*  people being too low in a planet? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1827.36s)]
*  But he's right. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1830.36s)]
*  He's right about birth rates. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1831.36s)]
*  He's right about birth rates. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1832.36s)]
*  Yeah, like I said, you do you. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1833.84s)]

*  We're just talking about doing me. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1837.6799999999998s)]
*  He's right about global birth rates are plummeting and that is extremely dangerous for the future [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1839.52s)]
*  of the world. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1844.48s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not an existential crisis. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1845.48s)]
*  It is. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1846.48s)]
*  It actually could be. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1847.48s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1848.48s)]
*  It is becoming a genuine crisis. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1850.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know why you would dismiss that. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1851.84s)]
*  Because I don't think it's an existential crisis. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1855.68s)]
*  It's cyclical. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1857.8s)]
*  Population rises and falls. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1859.72s)]
*  In the 70s, it was like, oh, it's an explosion of too many people. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1862.56s)]
*  We're not going to be able to feed the world's population. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1866.3600000000001s)]
*  And thankfully to people like Norman Borlaug, who through genetically modified organisms, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1869.48s)]
*  we're able to feed the people who are here. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1875.72s)]
*  It's not an existential threat that there are certain countries do face a far greater [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1877.8799999999999s)]
*  problem, South Korea, Japan, but the United States is not one of those countries. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1883.24s)]
*  This is born out of racism, that the birth rates are not falling in Africa, and it's [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1887.6799999999998s)]
*  the oh my God, black people will be the dominant force on the planet. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1892.76s)]
*  That's what this is born out of. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1896.76s)]
*  And that is what motivates Elon Musk, the guy who for sure didn't throw up a Nazi salute. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1898.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, he didn't. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1903.9599999999998s)]
*  He went from my heart to yours, as everybody knows. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1905.72s)]
*  It was a completely trumped up bullshit to claim it was a Nazi salute. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1908.1200000000001s)]
*  All right, Van, you've been gesticulating wildly. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1912.1200000000001s)]
*  You were laughing as Ari was talking about the petrol bombing of Tesla dealerships and [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1915.24s)]
*  so on. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1919.96s)]
*  Why is that funny? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1920.96s)]
*  Why would you not want to roundly condemn any act of violence, whether it's against [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1921.96s)]
*  cars, factories, dealerships, whether it's targeting people driving Teslas? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1926.44s)]
*  Why would any of that make you feel like you're amused? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1932.5600000000002s)]
*  So here's the thing, Pierce. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1937.3600000000001s)]
*  I watch your show all the time. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1938.92s)]
*  I enjoy it greatly. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1940.16s)]
*  You are good at the condemning game. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1941.8000000000002s)]
*  You're really good. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1944.16s)]
*  You're so good. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1945.16s)]
*  You're good at the like getting people on and go condemn this. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1946.16s)]
*  And it kind of takes the sting out of what we're actually talking about. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1949.7s)]
*  So I'm going to try not to do that. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1952.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to give you a condemn. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1953.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1954.8000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1955.8000000000002s)]
*  You're not going to condemn what's happening to Tesla? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1956.8000000000002s)]
*  No condemn. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1957.92s)]
*  No condemn. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1958.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1959.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1960.92s)]
*  I can tell you right now that I am not going to be involved in anything that has to do [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1962.68s)]
*  with anything violent, but I'm not playing your condemning game. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1967.92s)]
*  This is what I will say. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1970.68s)]
*  Why not? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1971.68s)]
*  Why wouldn't you condemn it? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1972.68s)]
*  About the actual point, because it's a trick bag and I'm not doing that. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1973.68s)]
*  What's the trick? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1977.0800000000002s)]
*  So it's a trick bag. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1978.0800000000002s)]
*  Pierce, you know it. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1979.68s)]
*  You know it's a trick bag. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1980.96s)]
*  What's the trick? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1982.28s)]
*  What's the trick? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1983.28s)]
*  The trick is this. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1984.28s)]
*  So the trick is this. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1985.28s)]
*  The trick is getting me to moralize with an immoral side. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1987.24s)]
*  With a crime. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1992.08s)]
*  With a crime, yeah. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1993.08s)]
*  With a crime. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1994.08s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1995.08s)]
*  So it's... [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1996.08s)]
*  I'm asking you to condemn a crime. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1997.08s)]
*  Literally. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=1999.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2000.52s)]
*  So what you're doing is you're getting... [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2001.52s)]
*  You want me to get on a moral high horse, right? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2003.04s)]
*  I want you to condemn criminal behavior. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2006.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2009.1599999999999s)]
*  Despite the fact that we could have all kinds of conversations about how Trump has broke [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2010.1599999999999s)]
*  the law, about how Trump supporters have engaged in violence, all of that stuff. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2015.6599999999999s)]
*  But that kind of gets glossed over while I'm trying to convince people how morally righteous [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2020.4599999999998s)]
*  and upstanding I am. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2025.1799999999998s)]
*  Okay, I know who I am. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2026.8999999999999s)]
*  No condemn. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2028.4199999999998s)]
*  No condemn. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2029.4199999999998s)]
*  This is what I'll say. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2030.4199999999998s)]
*  The main point of this, which is Elon Musk, right? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2033.7399999999998s)]
*  The Elon Musk of this entire thing. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2036.6399999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk did not just become a public enemy number one for people after he decided to [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2039.6999999999998s)]
*  support Donald Trump. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2047.58s)]
*  Elon Musk took over Twitter and brought hate speech back to Twitter. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2049.2999999999997s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2052.38s)]
*  Okay? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2053.38s)]
*  He brought hate speech back to Twitter. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2054.38s)]
*  What do you mean he brought hate speech back? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2055.38s)]
*  What do you mean he brought hate speech back? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2056.38s)]
*  Meaning that on Twitter, a lot of words, terms, phrases would get you banned and muted and [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2058.8599999999997s)]
*  kicked off the platform. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2066.62s)]
*  And they still do. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2067.62s)]
*  Elon Musk came back to Twitter. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2068.62s)]
*  They still do. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2070.1s)]
*  They really don't. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2071.1s)]
*  They still do. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2072.1s)]
*  What do you actually- [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2073.1s)]
*  The hate speech on Twitter has gone through the roof since Elon Musk- [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2074.1s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2078.1s)]
*  The hypocrisy is bananas here. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2079.1s)]
*  When do I get to just go? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2084.1s)]
*  Okay, let's look at it for a second. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2087.1s)]
*  How many videos do you need to see of politicians on the left making the exact same hand gesture [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2090.1s)]
*  and yet nobody's alarmed? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2097.42s)]
*  We've seen it over and over and over again from politicians like AOC being a perfect [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2099.42s)]
*  example. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2105.06s)]
*  However, you're upset about Elon Musk being an anti-Semite who happens to be friends with [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2106.06s)]
*  Jews, hired Jews, has never killed a Jew, and yet you're not upset about the swastika [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2110.62s)]
*  being scratched into his car. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2116.62s)]
*  How about the fact that the left- [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2118.9s)]
*  Has never killed a Jew? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2121.1s)]
*  Is that the reason that Kamala Harris didn't actually choose Josh Shapiro as her VP, although [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2122.1s)]
*  he would have probably been the best choice? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2127.8199999999997s)]
*  Could it be because he's Jewish? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2132.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2133.9s)]
*  Let's speculate at it. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2134.9s)]
*  You think it was because he was Jewish? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2135.9s)]
*  Or how about the fact, I do think that. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2137.1s)]
*  It's a hell of a high water mark that he hasn't killed a Jew. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2139.62s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2142.14s)]
*  He hasn't killed a Jew, therefore- [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2143.14s)]
*  What about the sick hail from all of your politicians? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2145.22s)]
*  Not only has he not killed a Jew- [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2149.18s)]
*  I'm not a Democrat. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2150.18s)]
*  He's hired Jews. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2151.26s)]
*  He's friends with Jews. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2152.46s)]
*  Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka has converted to Judaism- [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2153.94s)]
*  Jillian, Jillian, Jillian. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2157.9s)]
*  And they're very close friends. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2158.9s)]
*  I would imagine- [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2159.9s)]
*  Kamala Harris is married to a Jewish guy. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2160.9s)]
*  I can't. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2161.9s)]
*  You're full of crap. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2162.9s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2163.9s)]
*  What about this one? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2164.9s)]
*  Why are you not upset about Mahmoud Khalil? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2165.9s)]
*  Where's your outrage about this guy who's part of an organization that celebrates the [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2169.26s)]
*  October 7th attacks? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2173.86s)]
*  You want to breathe. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2175.86s)]
*  So you're saying that Kamala Harris is an anti-Semite because she didn't choose a Jewish [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2177.46s)]
*  running man. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2182.5s)]
*  I'm saying that I do believe that the Democratic Party did not choose- [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2183.5s)]
*  She's married to a Jewish guy. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2188.38s)]
*  I think- [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2189.38s)]
*  Can you- [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2190.38s)]
*  I'm not saying Kamala Harris. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2191.38s)]
*  Can you concede that point? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2192.38s)]
*  I'm saying that the Democratic Party- [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2193.38s)]
*  Can you concede that point? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2194.38s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2195.38s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2196.38s)]
*  She's married to a Jewish guy. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2197.38s)]
*  No, I'm talking about the party. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2198.38s)]
*  I am talking about the entire party. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2199.38s)]
*  So look at this. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2200.38s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2201.38s)]
*  Look at the level. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2202.38s)]
*  So tell me, why do you think they didn't choose Josh Shapiro? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2203.38s)]
*  I don't have no clue. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2206.9s)]
*  I wasn't in the meetings. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2207.9s)]
*  So Elon Musk is not an anti-Semite because he's never killed a Jew, right? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2208.9s)]
*  He's never killed a Jew, so that Elon Musk is not an anti-Semite. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2213.94s)]
*  That's not what I said. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2215.94s)]
*  Kamala Harris, that's exactly what you said. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2216.94s)]
*  You didn't just say that? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2218.94s)]
*  Obviously, I said to you, he is friends with Jews. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2219.94s)]
*  He hires Jews. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2223.2200000000003s)]
*  And he hasn't killed a Jew. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2224.2200000000003s)]
*  You never killed him? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2225.2200000000003s)]
*  You guys just carried him to Nazis who slaughtered 6 million Jews. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2226.2200000000003s)]
*  Obviously, there is no comparison. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2230.82s)]
*  And it's insulting to a person whose grandmother ran from the Nazis that you would even make [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2233.14s)]
*  such a grotesque comparison. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2238.14s)]
*  You are exploiting this tragedy, actually, that the Jews experienced to demonize this [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2241.5s)]
*  guy for political purposes. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2248.18s)]
*  And there's no question. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2249.42s)]
*  Where is your outrage about your own politicians making the exact same hand gesture? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2250.62s)]
*  Why are you guys defending Mahmoud Khalil? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2254.66s)]
*  God forbid we consider deporting this guy who's here on a visa. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2258.54s)]
*  And this is a guy who represents the C.U.A.D. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2264.02s)]
*  Who's sub-stack has an entire article supporting October 7th. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2267.82s)]
*  I can't wait for your hypocrisy. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2271.82s)]
*  It's bullshit. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2273.38s)]
*  There has been no due process. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2274.38s)]
*  If you want to talk about this nation and what we stand for, the rule of law and due [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2277.22s)]
*  process should be chief among them. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2282.1s)]
*  He's here on a visa. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2284.34s)]
*  I guarantee you. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2285.34s)]
*  I see you. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2286.34s)]
*  Well, if he... [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2287.34s)]
*  He... [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2288.34s)]
*  First of all, this has not played out. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2289.34s)]
*  It's being looked at. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2290.34s)]
*  Second of all, he's here on a visa. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2291.34s)]
*  The Constitution applies to him. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2292.34s)]
*  And I guarantee... [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2293.34s)]
*  The Constitution applies to him. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2294.34s)]
*  So tell me about your hate speech. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2295.34s)]
*  You're so upset about hate speech. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2297.34s)]
*  Are you upset about sub-stacks hate speech from C.U.A.D. celebrating October 7th? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2298.98s)]

*  All right. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2311.7400000000002s)]
*  Jesse, let me ask you this. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2312.7400000000002s)]
*  Jesse, hang on. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2313.7400000000002s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2314.7400000000002s)]
*  Jesse, would you condemn the attacks on Tesla, on the dealerships and so on, the firebombing [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2315.74s)]
*  of dealerships? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2322.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2323.06s)]
*  Do you... [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2324.06s)]
*  You can condemn that. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2325.06s)]
*  I don't understand why Van has such a problem with condemning obvious criminal behaviour. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2326.06s)]

*  But it is... [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2333.2s)]
*  They have broken the law. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2334.2s)]
*  It is civil disobedience. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2335.2s)]
*  And with civil disobedience, if you get caught, there is a consequence for that. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2336.7999999999997s)]
*  If I'm going to sit here and talk about the rule of law, I'm certainly not going to be [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2343.42s)]

*  the Constitution. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2360.38s)]
*  And how do you feel, Jesse, about Bill Ma going to see Trump at the White House for [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2362.5s)]
*  a dinner with Trump, with Dana White, with Kid Rock? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2367.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think... [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2370.98s)]
*  What a brain trust. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2373.34s)]
*  Kid Rock and Donald Trump and Bill Ma are all in one room to wax bigoted anti-science [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2374.98s)]
*  and maybe Dana White. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2382.62s)]
*  I don't know much about that. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2383.62s)]
*  Bill Ma is now a bigot. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2384.62s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2386.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2387.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2388.78s)]
*  What's bigoted about Bill Ma? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2389.78s)]
*  So because Bill Ma is sat with Donald Trump, he's now a bigot. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2390.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2393.78s)]

*  I feel like sometimes you guys don't pay attention. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2397.3s)]
*  Bill Ma is so Israel for God's sake. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2399.66s)]
*  Can I... [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2401.98s)]
*  You think that's the only form of bigotry in the world? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2402.98s)]
*  The reason is that I'm not a bigot now. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2405.98s)]
*  Hang on, hang on. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2407.98s)]

*  I'm going to tell you when he said it. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2425.98s)]
*  He said, I don't care where weirdos go to pee. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2427.14s)]
*  That is bigoted language. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2430.8599999999997s)]
*  Bill Ma is an anti-science, anti-vaxxer. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2432.94s)]

*  He's... [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2437.1s)]
*  Oh my God, he absolutely is not an anti-vaxxer. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2438.1s)]
*  He wishes he hadn't gotten the COVID vaccine. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2443.2999999999997s)]
*  Nor is he anti-trans. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2445.54s)]
*  And there are good reasons for his concerns on that particular vaccine. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2446.54s)]
*  All he wants with trans people, he wants trans people to stay out of women's spaces. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2451.14s)]
*  I happen to be very close with Bill Ma. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2454.14s)]
*  I know his position on this subject matter. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2455.66s)]
*  Are your backs sore because you're carrying a lot of water? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2456.66s)]
*  And he's the farthest thing from the bigot and anti-science. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2457.66s)]
*  You guys are the Bill Ma. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2458.66s)]
*  All right, Brian. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2459.66s)]
*  This is what I would say about Bill Ma. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2460.66s)]
*  So the Bill Ma shift has happened long ago, right? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2464.8199999999997s)]
*  The Bill Ma, Bill Ma got on his show, he said the N-word on his show. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2470.3399999999997s)]

*  Ice Cube came on his show and then they went back and forth about the fact that Bill Ma [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2476.54s)]
*  very casually said the word, said house nigga on his show. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYFSjH-cHyE&t=2481.62s)]
