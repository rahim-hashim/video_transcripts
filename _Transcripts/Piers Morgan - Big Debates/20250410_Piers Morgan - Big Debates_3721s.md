Video Description: Donald Trump says the US will hold direct talks with Iran on Saturday over an end to its nuclear program - and the consequences of not making a deal could be deadly. 

The President’s shock announcement came after weeks of speculation about a US or Israeli attack - and the aging Ayatollah has put Iran’s military on its highest level of alert. The US has also been pounding the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, plus Trump shared a video of a drone strike with the words: “Oops. There will be no attack by these Houthis.”

Tucker Carlson said “nothing would be more destructive to our country” and that a war on Iran would be “suicidal.”  Is he right?

To debate, Piers Morgan invites Iranian academic Mohammad Marandi, host of the ‘Scott Horton Show’ Scott Horton and co-host of ‘The Verdict with Ted Cruz’ Ben Ferguson - plus he speaks to ex CIA director and former US defense secretary Leon Panetta and British-Iranian lawyer and activist Elica Le Bon.

# ‘He KNOWS You’re Terrorists!’ Should Trump Bomb Iran? Marandi vs Panel On Nuclear Talks
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik)
*  Any attack on Iran by the United States would be illegal and a war crime. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=0.0s)]
*  It would not be Iraq. It would not be Afghanistan. It would not even be Vietnam. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=5.92s)]
*  The difference is that Iran can fight back. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=10.32s)]
*  I never knew I was going to do TV with someone that's basically in a hostage video. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=12.24s)]
*  We're not screwing around. We don't trust you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=15.44s)]
*  I don't think Iran needs to restore trust to America. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=17.84s)]
*  It's the United States that is waging war after war. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=20.96s)]
*  And I think your guess needs therapy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=24.88s)]
*  Your country chants death to America with the Ayatollah leading the chant [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=27.2s)]
*  in front of the entire country. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=31.44s)]
*  You want to talk about trust? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=33.2s)]
*  Go take your medicine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=34.64s)]
*  This is a person that's not speaking with free speech and even if he had free speech, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=35.68s)]
*  he would not be condemning this government because he served as an advisor to this government and as [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=38.88s)]
*  a member of the IRGC. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=43.28s)]
*  You're just proving my point. I'm not supposed to talk. I'm the token oriental. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=44.64s)]
*  Thank goodness for Dave Smith and for Tucker Carlson and for the rest of the people on the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=50.64s)]
*  MAGA right who know what America first means and a war with Iran is not in American national [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=55.6s)]
*  interest whatsoever. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=60.96s)]
*  President Trump says the US will hold direct talks with Iran on Saturday over an end to its [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  nuclear program. The consequences of not making a deal could be deadly. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=75.68s)]
*  I think if the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great danger. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=80.88s)]
*  And I hate to say it. Great danger because they can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's not a complicated formula. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=92.56s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. That's all there is. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=96.24s)]
*  Can't have it. Right now we have countries that have nuclear power that shouldn't have it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  But I'm sure we'll be able to negotiate out of that too as part of this later on down the line. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=104.56s)]
*  But Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And if the talks aren't successful, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  I actually think it'll be a very bad day for Iran if that's the case. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, Trump's shock announcement came after weeks of speculation about a US or Israeli attack. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=122.24s)]
*  The aging Ayatollah has put Iran's military on its highest level of alert. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=126.88s)]
*  The US has also been pounding the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=131.2s)]
*  And Trump shared this video of a drone strike with the words, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  oops, there will be no attack by these Houthis. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=138.8s)]
*  But not everybody in the president's camp is enjoying this drumbeat of war. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=142.0s)]
*  Tucker Carlson put this on X. He said nothing would be more destructive to our country [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=146.4s)]
*  and that a war on Iran would be suicidal. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=151.6s)]
*  Many people voted for Trump because he pledged to end wars, not start them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=154.24s)]
*  An influential wing of his base says the neocons are winning again at Israel's behest. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=157.92s)]
*  So before these talks take place, we're going to have our own with each of these views represented. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=162.8s)]
*  To debate, I'm joined by Professor Mohammed Miranda from the University of Tehran, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=168.0s)]
*  Scott Horton, the host of the Scott Horton Show, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=172.64s)]
*  and Ben Ferguson, the co-host of Verdict with Ted Cruz. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=175.2s)]
*  Welcome to all of you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=178.32s)]
*  We'll also be joined later in the show by former CIA director and former US [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=183.83999999999997s)]
*  Okay, Professor Mohammed Miranda, welcome back to Uncensored. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=186.72s)]
*  What is your reaction to Donald Trump saying Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=191.76s)]
*  and if the talks aren't successful, I actually think it will be a very bad day for Iran. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=196.88s)]
*  Well, first of all, I have to correct something. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=205.76s)]
*  And that footage that Trump tweeted was of a tribal gathering for the Eid. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  And he murdered innocent people. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=216.88s)]
*  They had nothing to do with ships. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  It had nothing to do with anti-ship missiles. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=223.12s)]
*  And anyone can look up, use a search engine to see that this is how [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=226.16s)]
*  traditional tribal gatherings take place. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=230.56s)]
*  So that's just one more war crime for the United States. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=234.64s)]
*  Iran is not developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=238.88s)]
*  Even Tulsi Gabbard admits such. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  And the United States admits that Iran, for the last 20 years at least, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=244.48s)]
*  has not been developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=248.88s)]
*  So Trump is being the elderly. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=251.52s)]
*  Trump is being dishonest when he says that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  He's implying that that is what Iran is pursuing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=260.16s)]
*  Its peaceful nuclear program is within the framework of international law. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=265.2s)]
*  It is within the framework of the IAEA and the NPT. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=269.2s)]
*  And so any attack on Iran by the United States would be illegal and a war crime. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  And of course, the United States does not have a mandate on behalf of the UN or anywhere else. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  So it's just another act of, it would just be another act of aggression. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=288.4s)]
*  But the difference is that Iran can fight back. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=292.96s)]
*  It would not be Iraq. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=295.44s)]
*  It would not be Afghanistan. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=297.12s)]
*  It would not even be Vietnam. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  All the small, tiny Arab dictatorships in the Persian Gulf that host US bases would be [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  complicit. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=309.28s)]
*  War would mean no more oil or gas from the Arabian Peninsula. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=310.4s)]
*  That would bring about a global economic meltdown and it would be the fault of the United States. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=315.76s)]
*  And Iran can hit the United States back very hard. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  War is foolish. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=324.64s)]
*  But the United States, since it has a history of bloodshed and aggression, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  Iran is preparing itself for such a possibility. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=332.32s)]
*  All right, Ben Ferguson, your facial expression suggests you don't entirely agree with the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=337.6s)]
*  professor. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=341.92s)]
*  Yeah, I never knew I was going to do TV with someone that's basically in a hostage video. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=343.44s)]
*  But now I understand how much control Tehran has over propaganda with their professors. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  I love how he acts like Iran is somehow peaceful when you guys are sponsoring the terrorist [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=351.76s)]
*  attacks on the Israeli innocent people. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=357.44s)]
*  You're sponsoring attacks on American soldiers. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=359.92s)]
*  You back all of the terrorist organizations, in essence, in the Middle East. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=362.24s)]
*  And then you say, oh, we're a peaceful group that doesn't like war and America is the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=365.92s)]
*  warmonger. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  I will tell you, take this message back to whoever controls what you say. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=370.4s)]
*  We're not screwing around. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=375.84s)]
*  We don't trust you. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=377.28s)]
*  You are a terrorist country that sponsors terrorism. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=378.4s)]
*  You either come to the table and do a sensible deal, which allows for us to verify that [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=381.36s)]
*  you're not having a nuclear program or prepare for the consequences of what you guys are [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=385.76s)]
*  doing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=391.36s)]
*  And the president is not going to be bought into this BS that you just put out there. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  He knows you're a terrorist organization. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=398.24s)]
*  He knows you sponsor terrorism. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=400.08s)]
*  He knows you kill innocent people. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=401.68s)]
*  He knows you want from the River of the Sea to annihilate Israel. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=403.28s)]
*  And the president is never going to allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  So I would wake up. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=410.24s)]
*  I hope that you will actually stand up to your government and tell them this is not [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=411.76s)]
*  an opportunity to mess around with the United States. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=416.56s)]
*  Donald Trump is not going to flinch. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=419.68s)]
*  Do a deal to protect your own people and innocent lives. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=421.92s)]
*  And the idea, as you say earlier, that there was a tribal gathering and this had nothing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  to do with attacking ships tells me how bad the propaganda is and how afraid maybe you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=429.04s)]
*  are for your life with your own government, which is really sad. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=434.64000000000004s)]
*  Scott Horton, I mean, the general presumption is that contrary to what the professor said, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=440.32s)]
*  Iran, if it actually got involved in a direct military conflict with the United States, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=446.56s)]
*  couldn't possibly survive very long if America flexes military muscles, because by comparison, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=453.6s)]
*  Iran just wouldn't even be at first base. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=461.2s)]
*  Is that your reading of it? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=464.4s)]
*  Well, so there's a lot of things in question here. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=468.32s)]
*  Nobody in all of the talk of war with Iran for the last 25 years, nobody's saying anything [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=472.4s)]
*  about invading the country. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=478.48s)]
*  And this is the real problem is we can't take out their anti aircraft without sending in [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=480.48s)]
*  the special operations forces by the tens of thousands to laze those targets for the cruise [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=484.48s)]
*  missiles to hit before we can even get air dominance over the country. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=489.6s)]
*  And that means thousands and thousands of so calm lives lost at the very least in an [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=493.2s)]
*  attempt just to have an air war over Iran. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=499.84s)]
*  And back in January of 2007, W. Bush went to the Pentagon and they took him down into the tank. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=503.52s)]
*  And the chiefs told him, yes, we'll go ahead and escalate the Iraq war with the surge, but we're [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=510.48s)]
*  not going to Iran. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=515.92s)]
*  And they told him why was America does not have what they call escalation dominance. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=518.32s)]
*  So in the event of an all out war between America and Iran, would America win eventually? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=524.72s)]
*  Of course, we got B-52s comes down to it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=530.4s)]
*  We got H bombs. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=532.88s)]
*  They do not have atomic weapons, but we have a lot of conventional weaponry that we can bring [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=534.0s)]
*  to bear too in the event of a full scale war. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=539.44s)]
*  But you're talking about D-Day type scale of invasion if we're going to actually conquer [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=542.4s)]
*  the country and guarantee regime change in Tehran, which is just far more than the Pentagon [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=548.08s)]
*  was willing to bite off and chew then wisely. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=553.84s)]
*  And I'm sure must be the case now. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=556.4s)]
*  So that's only one part of it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=558.48s)]
*  But I'd like to go back to the very first part of the framing of this whole thing. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=559.6s)]
*  I don't know that I'm right about this, but it's obviously very dangerous. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=562.48s)]
*  But I believe that what's going on here and I'm not spinning for Trump either. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=567.52s)]
*  I'm against this approach, but I believe that what's happening here is just like we saw with [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=571.12s)]
*  his threats against North Korea in his first term, when he threatened fire and fury like the world [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=575.6s)]
*  has never seen and all of these things. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=580.24s)]
*  He was really just trying to force Kim to the table. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=582.1600000000001s)]
*  That's his idea of an opening negotiation point. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=585.12s)]
*  And in this case, the Ayatollah's guys and Trump's guys are meeting this Saturday in Oman [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=588.48s)]
*  to start talking. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=594.4000000000001s)]
*  And the Iranians have said they're not just going to capitulate to American demands, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=595.5200000000001s)]
*  but of course they're open to negotiations. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=598.64s)]
*  And Pierce, there's plenty of room for negotiation here because as the professor said, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=600.96s)]
*  whether the Ayatollah's or the IRGC is holding a gun to his head or not, what he said is correct [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=605.12s)]
*  that Iran has a civilian nuclear program, which is first of all, they're members of [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=611.44s)]
*  the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=616.5600000000001s)]
*  And under that treaty, they have a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=619.0400000000001s)]
*  Agency, which they had long before even the Obama deal of 2015. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=623.12s)]
*  And so they were already guaranteed and safeguarded. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=628.32s)]
*  And the IAEA had verified that they were not diverting nuclear material to any military [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=631.84s)]
*  purpose. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=638.0s)]
*  So we already had that. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  Then when Obama came in, he added the deal of 2015, which essentially just scaled back [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=640.16s)]
*  Iran's civilian nuclear program further and expanded inspections. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=646.0s)]
*  And this is the deal that Trump unwisely, at Netanyahu's behest, tore up in 2018. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=650.7199999999999s)]
*  So now that's the deal that Trump needs to get back into. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=657.12s)]
*  He can call it something else and hopefully they can tweak a couple of things on the side. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=660.0s)]
*  But there's no way in the world that Iran's going to just give up their civilian nuclear [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=664.72s)]
*  program because, quite frankly, and I'm sure your other guest, I see him shaking his head, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=668.72s)]
*  but I'm sure he'll agree with this part at least, that what Iran has is a latent nuclear [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=673.28s)]
*  capability. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=679.52s)]
*  This is the same as Brazil or Japan, where they've proven that they have mastered the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=680.32s)]
*  fuel cycle. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=684.24s)]
*  They've proven that they can enrich uranium up to whatever percent they choose of uranium [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=684.96s)]
*  235, including they could, they never have, but they could obviously enrich up to weapons [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=689.6800000000001s)]
*  grade. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=695.76s)]
*  And so what they're saying is, don't make me do it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  It's essentially a standoff. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=699.2s)]
*  Iran is saying, if you bomb me, then I'll probably make nukes. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=700.8000000000001s)]
*  But if you don't bomb me, I won't. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  And the Americans are saying, don't make nukes or we'll bomb you. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=706.88s)]
*  So as long as everybody holds still, it's fine. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=710.64s)]
*  And we can negotiate a more peaceful and cooperative relationship going forward. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=714.4000000000001s)]
*  Because, quite frankly, there's no reason to believe that I've told them to make nukes [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=719.2s)]
*  unless we attack them purposefully. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=723.2800000000001s)]
*  I want to be respectful, but I want to jump in here. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=723.76s)]
*  There's no need to interrupt me. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=727.12s)]
*  I'm willing to listen to you. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=728.24s)]

*  All the details are in the description. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=822.16s)]
*  Now on with the show. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=824.0s)]
*  Okay, so here's the problem with this fantasy. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=828.0s)]
*  The fantasy that you're putting out there is implying that Iran is somehow a responsible [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=831.36s)]
*  nation in the world that is not a terrorist nation. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=836.48s)]
*  They are a terrorist nation. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=840.32s)]
*  Why did you say that? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=841.44s)]
*  I said that they were verified by the IAEA. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=841.52s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=843.52s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=844.72s)]
*  First of all, verifying and being on the edge of a nuclear weapon is two very different things. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=845.6800000000001s)]
*  And what I look at is the actions of Iran, not what you're talking about, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=851.28s)]
*  which is in this diplomatic kumbaya world. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=855.9200000000001s)]
*  The actions of Iran are clear. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=858.5600000000001s)]
*  They want to take out the little Satan and they want to hurt the big Satan. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=860.88s)]
*  That's their intentions. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=864.96s)]
*  That's not their actions. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=866.0s)]
*  Jews should not exist. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=866.64s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=867.28s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=868.24s)]
*  Their intentions are to kill. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=869.52s)]
*  They're going to describe their actions and they can read their minds. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=871.04s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=872.16s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=873.84s)]
*  Their intentions are to kill innocent people. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=874.88s)]
*  They did that in the training and the support of the attack on Israel. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=877.84s)]
*  I deal with reality, not what they say in propaganda when people have guns to their heads. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=882.16s)]
*  You look at their reality. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=887.52s)]
*  They were in charge of killing more American troops when we were in the Middle East, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=890.32s)]
*  backing it, supporting it, aiding it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=894.4s)]
*  The bombs that were used, the roadside bombs, they were all coming out of Iran. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=896.48s)]
*  They gave safe haven to the people that were killing American troops. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=900.0s)]
*  They were proud of that. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=903.04s)]
*  That is who they are. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=904.64s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=905.76s)]
*  Go back and look at the reports. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=906.72s)]
*  You look at Al Qaeda and ISIS and where were they getting the information, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=908.48s)]
*  the intelligence and the technology to kill American troops with roadside bombs? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=912.9599999999999s)]
*  They were getting it in Iran. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=917.6s)]
*  Listen, you don't even have your buy straight. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=919.04s)]
*  Hamas, Hezbollah. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=920.64s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to sit here and act like- [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=922.8000000000001s)]
*  You don't even have the propaganda right. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=925.52s)]
*  Just because it comes from you that I'm wrong. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=926.24s)]
*  I have the propaganda right because it's reality based in what happened, sir. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  The reality is Iran loves terrorist organizations in the Middle East [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=933.12s)]
*  that will go after American interests, true or false. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=937.44s)]
*  When America is in the Middle East, Iran is backing the terrorists that come after us, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=940.8000000000001s)]
*  true or false. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=944.4s)]
*  Every time in my lifetime, they've gone after American interests. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=945.44s)]
*  They do it in Israel as well. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=949.12s)]
*  This idea that you can sit down with these people like they are sane [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=950.88s)]
*  when clearly the leadership is a terrorist nation that wants to kill Americans and Jews, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=955.12s)]
*  you cannot allow them to have a nuclear program because they are terrorists. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=960.56s)]
*  They're not responsible citizens in the world. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=964.32s)]
*  They're not a responsible government in the world. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=966.4s)]
*  I'm not naive enough to think they'll ever be. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=968.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=972.08s)]
*  Well, listen, Pierce, let me respond to a couple things here. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=972.48s)]
*  Hang on one second. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=974.8s)]
*  First of all- [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=975.76s)]
*  Hang on one second. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=976.4s)]
*  Scott, I'm going to bring you back because we've got [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=978.08s)]
*  the former CIA director and former US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta now joining us. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=980.96s)]
*  Mr. Pineda, thank you very much for being back on Uncensored. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=986.48s)]
*  This comment from Donald Trump that if Iran tries to pursue a nuclear weapon, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=989.76s)]
*  he says he can't have one. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=996.88s)]
*  If the talks aren't successful, it will be a very bad day for Iran. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=998.08s)]
*  What's your view of that? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1001.6s)]
*  Well, Pierce, it's not a new position on the part of the United States. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1005.2s)]
*  It goes back to President Obama who basically made clear that the United States would not allow [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1009.4399999999999s)]
*  Iran to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1016.56s)]
*  That was true for Trump, and it also was true for Biden. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1020.0s)]
*  It is very much a position that the United States has made clear that [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1026.0s)]
*  it will not allow Iran to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1033.04s)]
*  Now, Iran is enriching fuel. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1037.12s)]
*  When Trump rejected the agreement, that would have put some limits on enrichment, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1040.7199999999998s)]
*  and that was working. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1046.6399999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, there wasn't a strategy to try to deal with Iran enriching fuel. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1048.8s)]
*  And so Iran has gone ahead and enriched a lot of fuel. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1054.1599999999999s)]
*  And some in the intelligence arena think that they are within [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1058.6399999999999s)]
*  a few weeks of being able to develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1063.4399999999998s)]
*  And so that's the concern. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1067.36s)]
*  And that's why I think both Israel and the United States are making clear [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1069.6s)]
*  that neither will allow Iran to, in fact, build a nuclear weapon. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1073.9199999999998s)]
*  That is a position that the United States has continually taken in a number of years. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1079.84s)]
*  Do you think Iran is more or less of a threat than it was, say, 10, 15 years ago? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1088.2399999999998s)]
*  Well, there's no question that Israel went after Iran in the midst of the Gaza war, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1093.6s)]
*  not only weakened their proxies, weakened Hamas, weakened Hezbollah, weakened other proxies, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1105.1999999999998s)]
*  but also did some damage directly to Iran. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1112.56s)]
*  And the proof of that is the fact that when Assad was stepping down, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1116.16s)]
*  and the hope that Iran and others would come to his aid, Iran didn't come to Assad's aid. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1123.76s)]
*  Russia didn't come to Assad's aid. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1130.24s)]
*  And so it's pretty clear that Iran has been weakened. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1132.8s)]
*  Having said that, they still remain dangerous. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1137.52s)]
*  They still are enriching fuel. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1141.04s)]
*  They're still building missiles. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1142.56s)]
*  And they do continue to support proxies in that region. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1144.64s)]
*  So they remain a threat. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1148.8000000000002s)]
*  Hopefully, the United States and Iran can sit down and negotiate some kind of agreement [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1151.44s)]
*  that can again restore limits on enrichment. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1158.5600000000002s)]
*  That's the hope we all have. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1161.8400000000001s)]
*  One of the issues, of course, that's acting as a kind of backdrop to all this [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1165.92s)]
*  is that America is currently engaged in an unprecedented global tariff war, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1171.2800000000002s)]
*  an economic war, if you like, on almost every other country in the world. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1177.1200000000001s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1182.16s)]
*  And how relevant is America's economic power to what it can do with, say, Iran at the same time? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1183.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, it's obvious that right now there's a lot of concern about what's happening with our economy [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1191.68s)]
*  and what's happening with this trade war that's going on with China and the rest of the world. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1198.8s)]
*  And there's a great deal of concern that that could very well weaken our economy [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1205.2s)]
*  and possibly even have us in a recession. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1211.6s)]
*  And possibly even have us in a recession. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1214.56s)]
*  So there is a lot of concern right now about the future of our economy and what will happen. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1217.52s)]
*  At least there's a lot of uncertainty about the direction of our economy at this point. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1225.6799999999998s)]
*  And that could very well weaken our national security as well. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1232.0s)]
*  So we've got to have a strong economy. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1237.6s)]
*  We've got to maintain a strong military. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1240.6399999999999s)]
*  We've got to be able to try to work with, frankly, work with our allies to try to ensure [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1243.28s)]
*  that we are doing everything necessary to try to prevent our adversaries in the world [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1251.76s)]
*  from being able to take advantage of the United States at this moment in time. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1258.24s)]
*  American homeowners are at risk of a growing real estate scam, which the FBI calls [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1264.96s)]
*  house stealing. This is how it works. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1269.1999999999998s)]
*  Criminals forge your signature on just one document, use a fake notary stamp, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1271.52s)]
*  pay a small fee and then file it with your local recorder's office. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1275.76s)]
*  Just like that, your home title is transferred out of your name. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1279.52s)]
*  Scammers can then take out loans using your equity as collateral or even sell the property [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1283.36s)]
*  behind your back. You won't even know it's happening until you start getting collection [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1288.32s)]
*  or foreclosure notices. When was the last time you checked your home title? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1292.6399999999999s)]
*  I own a home in the United States and the answer for me is never until now. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1296.64s)]
*  That's why I trust Home Title Lock. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1301.5200000000002s)]

*  And just finally, Mr. Bonetta, do you think that America under Donald Trump is more or less [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1353.5200000000002s)]
*  likely to achieve a peace deal both in Gaza between Israel, obviously, and Gaza and Hamas, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1362.0800000000002s)]
*  and also in Ukraine, given where we now see both of those wars? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1372.16s)]
*  Well, it's not an encouraging moment, that's for sure. I mean, President Trump himself said that [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1378.48s)]
*  he would be able to bring peace to the world in all of these areas soon after he took office, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1386.48s)]
*  and that obviously hasn't happened. He's made an effort to try to achieve a ceasefire. The [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1392.72s)]
*  to try to achieve a ceasefire. The ceasefire in Israel has broken down, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1398.88s)]
*  and there's renewed warfare in Israel. And the effort to try to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1405.92s)]
*  we had Ukraine agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire. And unfortunately, Putin pretty much rejected [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1414.8000000000002s)]
*  that approach, walked away from it, and continues to attack Ukraine. So right now, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1424.72s)]
*  I have to tell you that we're all pretty discouraged about the ability to achieve peace, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1432.24s)]
*  some kind of meaningful peace in those two areas of the world that are at war. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1440.0s)]
*  Leo Bonetta, as always, great to have you on our sensor. Thank you very much. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1448.72s)]
*  Good to be with you, Chris. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1452.6399999999999s)]
*  Okay, let's go back to the panel. Professor Morandi, there's been a lot to unpack since [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1456.6399999999999s)]
*  we first spoke on this panel. There's a lot of distrust, as you know, from America [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1461.6s)]
*  towards Iran, a lot of distrust on this panel from Ben Ferguson, to everything you're saying. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1467.84s)]
*  How do you restore trust in America? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1473.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't think Iran needs to restore trust to America. It's the United States that is [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1476.56s)]
*  waging war after war. And I think your guest probably has lost a lot of money on the stock [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1484.1599999999999s)]
*  market. Otherwise, I think he needs therapy. But beyond that, it's quite clear- [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1491.2s)]
*  Which country chants death to America? Your country. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1496.72s)]
*  Well- Your country chants death to America. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1500.3999999999999s)]
*  You want to talk about trust? I don't know what the hell the stock market has to do with [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1502.96s)]
*  the fact that I have a problem with a country that chants death to America with the Ayatollah [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1506.4s)]
*  leading the chant in front of the entire country. You want us to trust you again? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1511.2800000000002s)]
*  Stop chanting that. Stop sponsoring terrorism. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1516.0s)]
*  I seriously- I really think you do have psychological problems. But if, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1518.5600000000002s)]
*  Pierce, if you allow me, otherwise I don't know why I'm on this panel. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1522.72s)]
*  It's quite clear that the problems between the United States and Iran come from the United States. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1527.0400000000002s)]
*  The United States carried out a coup in Iran, imposed the Shah, built the secret police, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1534.24s)]
*  the SAVAK. Then the United States supported Saddam Hussein in his war against Iran. The West [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1540.8s)]
*  gave Saddam chemical weapons. I survived two chemical attacks. One was mustard gas and one [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1547.36s)]
*  was a nerve agent. And the West collectively was behind Saddam. Then they attacked Iran- [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1553.2s)]
*  Did you guys hold Americans hostage in our embassy in 1979 just out of curiosity? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1560.56s)]
*  Or do you just guys whitewash all of that with the propaganda? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1565.2s)]
*  Yes, that's a good point actually. Students took the embassy because the United States, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1568.8s)]
*  your regime- It wasn't students. It was the Shah and the team, buddy. Come on. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1574.3999999999999s)]
*  Your regime gave refuge to the Shah, who was a mass murderer, who had slaughtered people on the [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1578.72s)]
*  streets, and they wanted him back. The United States was aiding and abetting a mass murder, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1584.0s)]
*  who they were supporting. So the history between Iran and the United States- [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1591.44s)]
*  You guys aided mass murder every day when you support terrorist organizations. Will you ever [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1594.5600000000002s)]
*  stop supporting the terrorist organizations? Forget America for a second. You guys killing [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1599.68s)]
*  innocent people in the Middle East. You guys chant death to Israel. So forget America. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1603.76s)]
*  Calm down. Seriously, calm down. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1608.0s)]
*  Will you stop supporting the terrorist organizations? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1608.24s)]
*  Yeah, your government is the government that supports terrorists. Your government helped create- [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1611.36s)]
*  I actually feel bad for you. It must be miserable living in a prison where if you speak out against [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1617.76s)]
*  your government, you will be one of the disappeared ones. Because that's what happens to people that [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1624.56s)]
*  stand up to your terrorist government. You disappear. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1628.32s)]
*  Where people are arrested- [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1630.56s)]
*  No, we're not. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1631.04s)]
*  Yes, you're right. Where people in your country are arrested and deported- [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1631.76s)]
*  I'm free, my friend. I can say whatever I want to in America, unlike with you in Iran. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1634.72s)]
*  You can say whatever you want- [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1639.76s)]
*  Dude, your government propaganda. I feel bad for you. Freedom is not what you do. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1641.9199999999998s)]
*  As long as you're over- [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1646.9599999999998s)]
*  If you don't want me to talk- [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1647.76s)]
*  Let me ask you this question. Has your country- [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1648.8s)]
*  I'm not here for expectable- [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1651.52s)]
*  Let me ask you this, professor. Professor, I want to ask you a question. Have you ever disagreed [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1651.6s)]
*  ever publicly with your government in Iran on any one major issue? Have you ever spoken out? Or are [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1657.52s)]
*  you so afraid of your government that you know if you do, you will be one of the disappeared ones? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1664.8799999999999s)]
*  Since I'm sure your problems- [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1670.96s)]
*  One example. Just one example. You don't have one because you can't. I feel bad for you. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1674.56s)]
*  But if you knew- If your problems are deep and serious, but if you knew Persian, all you have to [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1679.44s)]
*  do is go and look at my interviews online and you can go and watch me on- [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1687.52s)]
*  Okay, professor. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1693.12s)]
*  Alright, hang on. Let me jump in. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1693.84s)]
*  And see what I say about different administrations. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1695.76s)]
*  But Pierce, if you don't want- [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1698.8s)]
*  Oh, let me jump in. No, I do want you- [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1700.1599999999999s)]
*  United States? Don't invite me. Don't invite me. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1704.0s)]
*  No. Professor, I often invite you because I want to hear the perspective from Iran as you know. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1707.84s)]
*  But it's an interesting question that Ben puts there, which is we're having a kind of panel [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1714.0s)]
*  debate here, which is unlikely to be tolerated in Iran in a broadcast manner. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1718.24s)]
*  Can you think of anything right now, as Ben said, where you would criticize your government, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1726.56s)]
*  for example, would you be prepared to do that publicly now or not? Or is there a [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1730.72s)]
*  feeling that you can't do that with the Iranian regime? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1736.24s)]
*  Pierce. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1741.1200000000001s)]
*  Pierce. Immature. Grow up. You are the person- [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1742.16s)]
*  He can't. He'll disappear. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1747.76s)]
*  ... who I invited to come to Iran. You are the person- Go take your medicine. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1748.48s)]
*  You are the person who I invited to come to Iran to visit the country and you refused the invitation. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1753.76s)]
*  So you're not in a position to ask such questions. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1761.44s)]
*  Because he's not an idiot. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1763.04s)]
*  You're not a serious journalist. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1764.4s)]
*  I wouldn't come to Iran either. I don't want to disappear like you're afraid of. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1765.6s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you won't come because we'd have to spend a lot of money on therapy for you and [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1769.44s)]
*  we have enough problems because of the sanctions. But that aside- [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1774.8799999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you another question. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1779.12s)]
*  Yes, bring in Scott because this time he won't let me talk. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1781.84s)]
*  Is there any terrorist activity that you condemn that your government has funded? Do you condemn [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1784.3999999999999s)]
*  the attack on the innocent people in Israel or any other attack by any terrorist organization [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1789.76s)]
*  that you guys have funded? Is there ever a moment in Iranian history, in your lifetime, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1794.8s)]
*  where you say supporting that terrorist organization funding aiding training, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1800.08s)]
*  you would condemn the attacks and the death of innocent people anywhere in the world? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1804.8799999999999s)]
*  I condemn and I condemn ethnosupremacism and an apartheid regime and I condemn this holocaust [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1810.96s)]
*  and I condemn what he gathered- [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1820.1599999999999s)]
*  Can't answer. He's bought and paid for by the regime. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1822.8799999999999s)]
*  ... admitted that the United States supports- [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1822.96s)]
*  He's bought and paid for by the regime. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1825.6799999999998s)]
*  ... has supported ISIS and al-Qaeda and they brought him to power. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1825.84s)]
*  I want to bring in Scott. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1830.56s)]
*  That is what I condemn and that is what the globe condemns. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1831.84s)]
*  And inside the United States you can talk all you want and you can convince Christian Zionists [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1835.52s)]
*  who think that Christ supports genocide, you can convince them that what you're saying makes sense. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1842.48s)]
*  But outside of the United States people are seeing what's going on in Gaza every day. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1849.68s)]
*  I can't imagine how fearful you must be of your government in this illicit response. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1853.12s)]
*  I want to bring in Scott. Scott, guys, I want to bring in Scott. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1855.12s)]
*  Making America healthy again is all the rage and many people are inspired [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1860.0s)]
*  to put their fitness first again. That's why I'm excited to be working with Don and my team [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1863.9199999999998s)]
*  at Jacked Up Fitness, which is an amazing American company. Last week they installed their flagship [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1868.7199999999998s)]

*  Scott, I want to play you a clip from Dave Smith who was on my show recently and he said this [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1926.32s)]
*  afterwards. If Donald Trump actually does launch a war in Iran, not only will I not support it, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1931.76s)]
*  I will apologize for the rest of my life for voting for the guy. I have loyalty to my [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1942.32s)]
*  principles and my country and my family. Now that's adding to the voice of Tucker Carlson [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1948.16s)]
*  and others on the right. There's no doubt that I think if Donald Trump was to attack Iran, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1956.32s)]
*  it would not have widespread support on the Republican side. In fact, you could see large [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1963.92s)]
*  numbers of Republicans and conservative commentators criticizing that move, which makes it quite a [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1969.84s)]
*  perilous political decision for Donald Trump. Yeah, well, especially considering how it's likely [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1976.48s)]
*  to play out, but I just say thank goodness for Dave Smith and for Tucker Carlson and for the [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1983.76s)]
*  rest of the people on the MAGA right and the America First right who know what America First [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1989.04s)]
*  means. And it doesn't mean Israel instead. It means American national interests and a war with [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=1994.32s)]
*  Iran is not an American national interest whatsoever. Tucker Carlson and Dave Smith are [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2000.48s)]
*  both 100% right about that. And man, I got to tell you, I almost voted for Trump, Piers, and [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2004.8799999999999s)]
*  especially when I heard that guy Jack Smith filed new charges in the middle of October. I was like, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2010.88s)]
*  no, that's it. I'm voting Republican. I can't stand. The Democrats deserve to be punished like [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2015.44s)]
*  they just burned Waco yesterday. I despise them. And I almost did, but I couldn't do it. And the [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2020.8000000000002s)]
*  reason why is because Trump is so beholden to Zionism and Israel. And it just is such, and we [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2027.1200000000001s)]
*  know this from the last time that he was in office. It is such a huge flaw in making America great and [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2033.8400000000001s)]
*  putting America first is Israel instead. And there's just no question that our anti-Iran policy [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2040.0s)]
*  is born in Tel Aviv. You know, our friend here mentioned the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Well, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2045.52s)]
*  that egg was on the face of Zbigniew Brzezinski. He was Jimmy Carter's national security advisor, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2050.88s)]
*  and he was the one, just as much as Carter, who was humiliated by the Iranian Revolution and the [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2056.32s)]
*  hostage crisis and the rest. Absolutely. But by 1993, the old mean old Ayatollah Khomeini was dead. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2062.64s)]
*  The new Ayatollah was in. They had a reformist president named Rafsanjani who was in, who was [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2070.24s)]
*  all about trying to kiss up to America. And Brzezinski said, we should build an oil pipeline [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2075.2s)]
*  from the Caspian Basin across Iran to the Persian Gulf, that way to make money and also to begin to [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2080.16s)]
*  warm up relations with Iran. Let bygones be bygones. And according to Steve Levine in his [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2086.56s)]
*  book on the pipeline wars and according to the Washington Post, it was the Israel lobby [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2094.4s)]
*  back in 1993 that vetoed this warming of relations with the United States. And Brzezinski lost that [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2099.12s)]
*  battle. Instead, they famously made the BTC pipeline, cutting out Iran and Russia both. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2106.0s)]
*  And so, and then on top of that, it was Yitzhak Shamir's advisor, Martin Indyk, who came in, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2112.48s)]
*  and this is in Bill Clinton's first year, and said, where Clinton wanted to try to normalize [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2119.1200000000003s)]
*  relations with Iraq and Iran, it was the Israelis that insisted on the dual containment policy, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2125.6000000000004s)]
*  which said, Iraq is so weak because you just beat it up in Iraq War I, but now Iraq isn't [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2132.2400000000002s)]
*  powerful enough to balance against Iran. So now America has to stay in Saudi Arabia to bomb Iraq [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2137.2799999999997s)]
*  and to blockade Iraq and enforce the sanctions also against Iran throughout the 1990s. And Pierce, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2144.3999999999996s)]
*  as I'm sure you know, this is the primary cause of the September 11th attack. This is what caused [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2150.24s)]
*  America, Britain, and Saudi Arabia's terrorist mercenaries to turn against the United States, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2156.3199999999997s)]
*  was bombing Iraq from bases in Saudi Arabia, a policy insisted upon by the Israelis. And it [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2161.68s)]
*  was also, of course, Israel's merciless violence against the people of Palestine and Lebanon that [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2168.48s)]
*  caused Egyptian engineering students studying in Hamburg to go volunteer for a Saudi to kamikaze [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2174.8799999999997s)]
*  our towers as revenge for what Israel was doing to their innocent victims. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2182.72s)]
*  If this is what you believe, you haven't looked at the writings of Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2186.64s)]
*  Mohammed, the mastermind of 9-11. I can't hear what you're saying. I wasn't done talking yet. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2188.72s)]
*  What? Hold on. No, no. Well, I don't care if you were not done. I listened to you for a long time, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2192.08s)]
*  go off on something that's not factually accurate. So Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9-11, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2197.04s)]
*  if you look at what he has said, he would say what you just said is not accurate. That's the guy [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2202.24s)]
*  that mastermind 9-11. That's what he said. Go look at everything that he said. That he said a lot [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2207.04s)]
*  more than that. And I'm sorry that it's not as simplistic as he's trying to make it out to be. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2212.7999999999997s)]
*  Osama bin Laden's own writings. Osama bin Laden's own writings are disagree with your simplistic way [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2216.4s)]
*  of describing this, but Piers, let me go back to the core issue here, which is today and now. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2224.0s)]
*  I'm not in favor of invading Iran. I'm in favor of making sure we do what we have to do to make [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2228.64s)]
*  sure they do not have a nuclear weapon because Iran cannot be trusted with a nuclear weapon full [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2235.6800000000003s)]
*  stop. We know this for centuries of what they have done. Again, let me finish what I'm saying and then [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2241.2s)]
*  you can disagree. They're weeks away from having what you need for a nuclear bomb. I believe Iran, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2247.2s)]
*  when they chant death to America and death to Israel. And the idea that somehow this is, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2253.92s)]
*  you know, this isolationist idea that some have in the MAGA group, and I disagree with them, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2259.12s)]
*  that this is the fault of a connection between Israel and America. Look at who is chanting death [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2263.7599999999998s)]
*  to America and death to Israel, who refers to the big Satan, the little Satan. You want to get two [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2270.24s)]
*  people together, then talk about them that way because they will get together. So the fault of [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2274.8799999999997s)]
*  this allegiance between Israel and America is the fault of the terrorist organization, which is Iran. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2280.24s)]
*  And when you chant it and you do it and you back it and you aid it and you fund it, the terrorism, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2286.56s)]
*  you get the situation we're in right now. America and Israel did not create this situation. The damn [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2292.24s)]
*  terrorists did it in Iran and they've been doing it for decades. Okay, well, what's funny is... [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2298.16s)]
*  Okay, I want to just pause before... Hang on, Scott. Hang on, Scott, because we've just got [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2304.64s)]
*  another contributor joining us briefly. Elyka Labonne, the British-Iranian attorney who's no [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2309.92s)]
*  stranger to uncensored. Welcome back to you, Elyka. It seems to be a pretty critical moment here for [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2316.08s)]
*  Iran, for what America may do with Iran. Donald Trump making it very clear. If these talks that [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2323.6s)]
*  they're going to have about Iran agreeing not to have a nuclear weapon fail, then all hell's going [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2329.92s)]
*  to break loose. What do you make of that? Well, I mean, first I just want to address some of the [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2336.72s)]
*  things that have been covered already because we're seeing already a lot of hypocrisy. We're [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2341.36s)]
*  talking about, you know, ethno supremacy. We're talking about apartheid completely ignoring the [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2345.6s)]
*  religious supremacy that exists in Iran, completely ignoring the gender apartheid that exists in Iran. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2351.68s)]
*  I'm sorry, you cannot be against apartheid when you're in support of gender apartheid. And as [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2357.6s)]
*  Ben mentioned, this is a person that's not speaking with free speech. And even if he had free speech, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2362.24s)]
*  he would not be condemning this government because he served as an advisor to this government and as [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2367.44s)]
*  a member of the IRGC. So you have a dual motivation not to be honest. And this conversation cannot be [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2371.8399999999997s)]
*  honest with a person of that stature. And then you go to the gentleman who starts talking about how [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2377.36s)]
*  all of this sectarian violence and terrorism is because of the U.S. and Western interference. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2382.8s)]
*  This is straight up jihadist propaganda because even in Osama bin Laden's letter to America, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2388.08s)]
*  everything he said was a lie. He talked about interference in Yemen here, there, and the other. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2394.88s)]
*  He was the one that was blowing up people in Yemen. He is the jihadist. He is the one that wanted to [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2399.2000000000003s)]
*  destroy the Middle East and by using Western imperialism as a cudgel to expand their own [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2404.32s)]
*  Islamist expansionism and to support that, to use that as propaganda, is to literally proliferate [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2411.52s)]
*  jihadist propaganda. And so, no, I don't respect any of these opinions that have been offered. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2420.0800000000004s)]
*  In terms of what's going on now with the potential war with Iran, this is a direct result of failing [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2425.44s)]
*  to support the people's uprising, failing to properly enforce sanctions that have strengthened [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2431.6s)]
*  the regime, that have financially strengthened the regime, that have increased its networks, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2438.08s)]
*  its exports, its complicated banking systems that allow it to move money from these oil exports, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2443.44s)]
*  from smuggling, all of these ways that have enriched the regime by abandoning the Iranian people [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2450.0s)]
*  who could have and would have taken out the regime for itself so that we wouldn't have to [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2455.6s)]
*  get to this position of war. So, yeah, you can be anti-war, but you cannot be pro-jihadist and [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2459.92s)]
*  pro-terror and blame everything that the terrorists do on the actions of the West. And by doing so, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2465.92s)]
*  you are fueling into jihadist propaganda and not just fueling into jihadist propaganda. You are [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2471.6800000000003s)]
*  playing directly into the racism of low expectations by assuming that Middle Eastern people are [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2477.12s)]
*  completely incapable of evil without the devil made them do it justification that the West [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2483.44s)]
*  encouraged them to do something that they've been doing for 1400 years. So if it's Western [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2489.76s)]
*  imperialism that caused jihadism, what caused jihadism in the seventh century when it expanded [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2495.84s)]
*  across the entire Middle East and North Africa, which is an imperialist expansion? It is not from [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2501.2000000000003s)]
*  Western imperialism. Western imperialism may have helped. It is an indigenous movement from the [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2506.5600000000004s)]
*  Arabian Peninsula out into the Middle East. That is imperialism. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2512.96s)]
*  All right, Professor Miranda, you've been listening to that. What is your response to Ali Qilibon? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2518.8s)]
*  Well, yes, you definitely don't want anyone from Iran to talk. That's obvious. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2524.8s)]
*  You bring in guests. Why are you on the show? And then you're literally an invited guest on my show. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2531.84s)]
*  No, you don't let me talk. If I'm not going to be interrupting you. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2537.92s)]
*  Freedom, brother. Maybe you should have some in your life. That's my medication. It's called [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2544.2400000000002s)]
*  freedom. Hang on. To be clear, Professor Miranda, the only difference between this appearance [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2547.52s)]
*  and your previous ones is always before you've appeared on your own. And this time we thought [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2555.6800000000003s)]
*  it would be more interesting to have other panelists who don't share your views, who might [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2561.6800000000003s)]
*  have their own insight into what happens in Iran. No, no. I did not improvise. Hang on. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2566.48s)]
*  I did not. You're afraid for me to speak. No, but it seems to me, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2574.08s)]
*  it seems to me though, Professor Miranda, you don't like being challenged by other people, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2578.4s)]
*  do you? That's the reality. I'm from Iran, sir. I'm from Iran. But let me tell you something. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2583.04s)]
*  Let me tell you something. I'm Iranian. You're just proving my point. Listen, listen. You're [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2590.2400000000002s)]
*  just proving my point. I'm not supposed to talk. I'm echoing the voice of the Iranian people. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2595.84s)]
*  I'm the spoken oriental. They cannot sit where you're sitting. You're not achieving anything by [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2602.4s)]
*  this. You enjoy the privilege. You enjoy the privilege. Let Professor Miranda now respond. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2609.92s)]
*  Professor Miranda, you may respond. But I haven't finished my sentence for him to respond. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2621.9199999999996s)]
*  Can I finish my sentence? Wait a minute, Erika. Don't talk over him. Let him respond. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2625.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So I think I'm glad that they've proven my point. And that was the objective all along. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2631.7599999999998s)]
*  You have a token, Iranian, to pretend that you have an open debate and then you bring in [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2639.2s)]
*  people one after another. And I have not interrupted a single person. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2647.04s)]
*  I have not interrupted anyone. That's also a lie. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2651.36s)]
*  But anyway, just to respond, first of all, we all know who created Al-Qaeda. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2653.84s)]
*  We all know who created ISIS. We all know who created the tragedy in Afghanistan. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2661.52s)]
*  It actually began before the Soviet Union invaded. Brzezinski proposed a plan [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2668.64s)]
*  to Carter. And that's when things began to roll. And the 1980s was the decade where [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2676.0s)]
*  Al-Qaeda was on the rise. Then in Syria, we had Operation Timber Sycamore. Your American [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2683.04s)]
*  guest speaks about who do I condemn terrorism. In Operation Timber Sycamore, the terrorists [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2692.16s)]
*  which they supported in Libya and destroyed Libya, which today is a destroyed country, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2699.12s)]
*  those terrorists were taken to Turkey and also from Jordan to bring down the Syrian government. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2706.3999999999996s)]
*  And Tulsi Gabbard, who is in Trump's administration, she said that we supported [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2712.56s)]
*  these terrorist groups, ISIS and Al-Qaeda, which now have taken Syria. These are not the words of [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2721.2799999999997s)]
*  an Iranian. Other than that, what we're seeing in Gaza, you've gone over this many times. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2727.2799999999997s)]
*  This did not begin on October the 7th. This has been going on for decades. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2734.64s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. Are you saying that Iran has never supported ISIS or Al-Qaeda? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2738.88s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? Are you saying that Iran has never aided or abetted ISIS or Al-Qaeda? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2743.2000000000003s)]
*  And somehow ISIS and Al-Qaeda has operated outside of the sphere or influence or money [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2747.6000000000004s)]
*  or weaponry coming from Iran? Are you insane? Or is this just other people in the room pointing [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2753.52s)]
*  guns at you right now? And this is the propaganda you have to share. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2758.0s)]
*  Pierce, Mr. Morgan, the Defense Intelligence Agency document of 2012. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2762.4s)]
*  Are you telling me that Iran has never supported Al-Qaeda or ISIS operators? Yes or no? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2770.16s)]
*  Pierce, let me get you for a second. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2776.32s)]
*  Who supported ISIS and Al-Qaeda in Syria? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2777.84s)]
*  I've never watched a hostage video like this in my life. This is really sad. I didn't realize [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2784.32s)]
*  it was this bad for you guys in Iran, but man, it's bad. Listen, the fact that this guy is [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2790.08s)]

*  Pierce, as I said before, if you go and look at the document of the Defense Intelligence Agency, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2799.92s)]
*  2010. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2809.68s)]
*  You're the one interrupting me, lady. What the hell? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2810.24s)]
*  Listen, Professor Miranda, you are interrupting the female ballot. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2812.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2818.8s)]
*  I did say I didn't interrupt. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2819.1200000000003s)]
*  I never said I was speaking. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2820.56s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2822.1600000000003s)]
*  Because you interrupted me when you started speaking again. You are right that it's so bad [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2826.6400000000003s)]
*  in Iran. Okay, I want to clarify this. You're so right that it's bad in Iran that the actual [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2831.1200000000003s)]
*  people that represent the people of Iran cannot come to this show. And this is a person that [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2836.1600000000003s)]
*  enjoys the privilege of siding with the regime and therefore his voice can be heard. But what [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2840.96s)]
*  you're wrong about is the idea that he would criticize this regime if he had the chance. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2845.6s)]
*  It doesn't matter if he had freedom of speech. He would not criticize this regime because he [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2850.48s)]
*  is a supporter of this regime. And that's evident in his ideologies, as with the gentleman beside [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2854.16s)]
*  him. Both of these people are people who indirectly or directly support the regime by whitewashing [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2859.44s)]
*  their crimes and just counterfactual narratives about how the West created Islamist groups. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2865.04s)]
*  Islamism has existed for 1400 years. And the revival of that was after the collapse of the [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2873.6800000000003s)]
*  Ottoman Empire. That's when the Islamic revivalist movement, and that was nothing to do with Western [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2880.96s)]
*  imperialism. That was the idea that they wanted to restore the Islamic caliphate. And everything [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2885.92s)]
*  that they've done in furtherance of that has been behind the pretext of anti-Western imperialism. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2890.8s)]
*  You talk about how, yes, Carter absolutely did so much damage by not just supporting the Taliban in [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2896.48s)]
*  Afghanistan, but also bringing this regime to power by supporting Khomeini, by fermenting [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2903.36s)]
*  anti-Shah sentiments to galvanize the 1979 revolution. But what you're ignoring is that [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2909.2s)]
*  while the West facilitated this through imperialism, those factions existed because it is a rudiment of [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2916.88s)]
*  the Middle East. And to deny that is to deny the agency and ability of Middle Eastern people to [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2923.68s)]
*  engage in the same evil, if not more, as the West. And if you deny that, you are not being honest. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2929.7599999999998s)]
*  All right. Let me go here for a minute. Scott Horton. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2936.0s)]
*  What we have here is an obvious and basic aggressive refusal to distinguish between [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2938.64s)]
*  the Sunnis and the Shiites in the current wars over there. In Iraq War II, 4000 Americans died [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2944.72s)]
*  fighting against the Sunni-based insurgency that was led by al-Qaeda in Iraq, was the vanguard of [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2951.52s)]
*  that. And they fought on the side of the Shiite alliance, which was also backed by Iran. That was [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2957.6s)]
*  Skiri, Dawah, and the Saudarists. Now, when our friend here says that Iran backed guys that killed [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2964.24s)]
*  the Americans in Iraq War II, that wasn't backing al-Qaeda and the radical Sunnis against America. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2970.64s)]
*  That was their support for Muqtada al-Saudar, who America was fighting the whole War IV, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2976.72s)]
*  but also for a short time in 2004 and in 2007 turned on him and attacked him. And 500 Americans [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2982.16s)]
*  died fighting Iraqi Shiites, not Iranians. And as I demonstrated in my book enough already, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2989.12s)]
*  I got 10 different sources of American reporters there where American soldiers found these factories [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=2994.72s)]
*  where they were making these EFP roadside bombs in Iraq being made by Iraqis. Okay. So no, Iran [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3000.72s)]
*  did not back al-Qaeda. They backed the same side America backed against al-Qaeda in Iraq War II. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3008.64s)]
*  And then you talk about Syria. You say that Iran backed al-Qaeda. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3015.3599999999997s)]
*  Hold on, the question I asked was not about that. Hold on, the question I asked. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3018.8799999999997s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3021.36s)]

*  You just don't even know whose side who is on here and you're trying to lecture me about it. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3081.36s)]
*  I guess I did go to an exact time that you're talking about. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3086.44s)]
*  I said in a lifetime, I said in the lifetime of ISIS and al-Qaeda, has Iran ever backed them? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3090.6800000000003s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3097.84s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3099.08s)]
*  I'm not talking about in this exact moment that you're talking about. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3099.84s)]
*  I said over the lifetime, over the lifetime of Iran, you're telling me on TV right now that Iran has never backed ISIS or [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3102.6400000000003s)]
*  al-Qaeda. You're insane. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3111.16s)]
*  You're a joke if you want to look at me and tell me that Iran has never backed them. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3112.64s)]
*  No, Iran has never backed ISIS or al-Qaeda. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3117.24s)]
*  It's bullshit. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3118.24s)]
*  Golly man, sell your book. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3119.24s)]
*  But I'm sorry, it's stupid. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3121.72s)]
*  Let's take your question. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3123.3599999999997s)]
*  Who does suicide attacks inside Iran? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3125.24s)]
*  It's ISIS that does suicide attacks inside Iran. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3127.48s)]
*  Let's take your statement as it is. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3130.44s)]
*  You said that the regime in Iran backs Hezbollah and it backed Assad. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3133.04s)]
*  What was that backing for? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3137.3199999999997s)]
*  Can you clarify? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3138.96s)]
*  In general, in general, why does the regime in Iran back Hezbollah in Lebanon as an act of imperialism and Assad in Syria as an act of imperialism? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3140.2000000000003s)]
*  Explain. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3151.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, Hezbollah... [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3154.56s)]
*  Professor Morandi, maybe you can respond to that. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3155.84s)]
*  Nothing to say? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3157.76s)]
*  No, no, no, I want this question. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3158.6800000000003s)]
*  This ghostwriter didn't write that part of the book, apparently. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3160.48s)]
*  I want you to answer the question. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3163.36s)]
*  Look, Hezbollah... [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3165.44s)]
*  Go on, tell me. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3166.44s)]
*  I'll answer the question for you if you can't answer. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3168.28s)]
*  I'm perfectly willing to answer the question here. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3171.68s)]
*  Hezbollah was created in reaction to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the early 1980s. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3174.68s)]
*  They didn't even come into existence until after the Beirut bombing of 1983, when the Israelis invaded to attack the PLO. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3180.88s)]
*  But they mistreated the poor Lebanese Shiites who had nothing to do with the PLO. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3190.4s)]
*  And forced them into resistance. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3196.96s)]
*  Now, that's not to justify everything that Hezbollah has done, but that's the true origin of their parties. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3199.16s)]
*  That's not the true origin. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3204.56s)]
*  And then, yes, it's true that Iran has supported them since then. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3206.64s)]
*  And I'm not saying that that's a good thing. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3210.04s)]
*  You need to find a new ghostwriter, man. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3211.6s)]
*  Oh, no, no. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3213.32s)]
*  That's the reason that Americans intervened in the Middle East is to try to break the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah alliance. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3214.08s)]
*  And they keep only making it powerful. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3221.36s)]
*  Because it is a dangerous terrorist alliance. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3222.44s)]
*  What does it have to take to get through to you? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3225.72s)]
*  The way that Hezbollah was created was that after the establishment of the regime in 1979, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3228.16s)]
*  the IRGC asked for a corridor through Syria to get to Lebanon. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3235.24s)]
*  And then it started its ideological exportation into Lebanon in order to create an Islamic republic in Lebanon. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3240.04s)]
*  This is an act of imperialism. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3247.08s)]
*  And Nasrallah himself came out and said that the objective of Hezbollah through the regime in Iran [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3248.8s)]
*  was to create a second Islamic republic in Iran. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3255.28s)]
*  And Nasrallah himself said that... [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3258.1600000000003s)]
*  Sounds like Israel's program. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3259.2400000000002s)]
*  No, don't interrupt me. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3260.7200000000003s)]
*  Nasrallah himself said that Hezbollah's budget eats, drinks and breathes from the regime in Iran. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3262.6800000000003s)]
*  And what does it do in exchange? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3269.7200000000003s)]
*  It's quit- [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3271.1600000000003s)]
*  They don't exist without them. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3271.76s)]
*  It's to act as the front line in the regime's proxy war against Israel. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3273.44s)]
*  Okay, so it's a mutually beneficial relationship that is rooted in pure imperialism and Islamist expansion. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3279.56s)]
*  And if you support that, you are an imperialist. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3288.1600000000003s)]
*  Which explains perfectly why the government supports the Bin Ladenites against the Shiites. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3290.96s)]
*  Because that's what Israel wants. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3295.84s)]
*  Even though the Bin Ladenites are the ones that knocked Hezbollah down. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3297.96s)]
*  That's why Hezbollah and the regime in Iran create- [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3301.64s)]
*  That's called survival. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3304.36s)]
*  Nasrallah did knock the towers down. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3305.56s)]
*  That was the Sunnis that did that. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3306.56s)]
*  What has that got to do with Israel? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3308.92s)]
*  Okay, I want to end by asking Professor Morandi- [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3310.36s)]
*  Israel is the victim of Hezbollah oppression. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3315.56s)]
*  Alright, time out. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3318.7599999999998s)]
*  I want to ask Professor Morandi to finish this, the way we started. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3320.16s)]
*  Which is that Donald Trump has laid down a very clear directive. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3323.52s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3327.3199999999997s)]
*  Do you believe Iran will develop a nuclear weapon in spite of what the president is saying? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3330.4s)]
*  Well, Piers, first of all, from I think your audience can see who is calm and who is irrational. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3338.2400000000002s)]
*  Who's logical and who's illogical. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3345.2000000000003s)]
*  I think enough has been said. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3347.84s)]
*  But I just want to point out a couple of things before I respond to that. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3349.8s)]
*  One is that it seems as if it is Iran that has occupied Palestine. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3353.48s)]
*  It is Iran that occupied Iraq. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3361.28s)]
*  Iran occupied Afghanistan. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3363.64s)]
*  Iran occupied Syria. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3366.08s)]
*  Iran occupies Libya. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3368.16s)]
*  Iran occupies parts of Yemen. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3370.04s)]
*  You just support all the terrorists that are killing us and people there. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3372.8s)]
*  You're a good point. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3375.28s)]
*  You don't occupy. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3376.08s)]
*  You just support the terrorists that do the work. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3376.96s)]
*  It seems to me that Hezbollah, which was created in 1982, pointed out it was a national liberation [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3378.36s)]
*  organization that expelled the Israeli regime from Lebanon, which occupied the capital of Lebanon. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3389.0800000000004s)]
*  And Israel existed. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3395.1600000000003s)]
*  Terrorists. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3397.56s)]
*  The resistance. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3398.32s)]
*  Terrorists? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3400.1600000000003s)]
*  How can they be terrorists? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3400.96s)]
*  You fool. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3402.4s)]
*  You fool. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3404.0800000000004s)]
*  The resistance in Palestine existed. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3405.16s)]
*  This is going to come to a shock to these two people. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3410.44s)]
*  But the resistance in Palestine began before the revolution. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3413.16s)]
*  You did your job today, OK? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3416.52s)]
*  You're going to live to see another day of propaganda. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3417.72s)]
*  Good job. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3419.7599999999998s)]
*  The resistance in Palestine began before the revolution in Iran. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3420.44s)]
*  But these two people have no future. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3425.12s)]
*  But can you answer my question? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3426.52s)]
*  We're talking about Hamas. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3428.72s)]
*  No, he can't answer your question, Pierce, because he'll be disappointed if he answers [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3429.68s)]
*  your question. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3433.3599999999997s)]
*  All right, everyone, time out. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3434.96s)]
*  I want to ask Professor Moran. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3436.76s)]
*  Professor Morandi, answer my question. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3439.36s)]
*  Do you believe Iran will develop a nuclear weapon in spite of what Donald Trump has said? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3441.6s)]
*  Iran has said from day one that it is not developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3449.2400000000002s)]
*  And that is what US intelligence agencies have been saying for years. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3453.76s)]
*  And just recently, Fulsi Gabbard's organization has repeated the same thing over, I [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3458.2s)]
*  again, that Iran is not developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3464.88s)]
*  What is happening is that the United States is being pushed by the Zionist lobby and the [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3469.1200000000003s)]
*  Israeli regime towards confrontation, a confrontation that it will not win. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3473.84s)]
*  No one will win on this planet. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3478.1200000000003s)]
*  But in any case, the Iranians have a right to a peaceful nuclear program. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3480.08s)]
*  The Iranians will continue to have a peaceful nuclear program. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3483.96s)]
*  And if the United States behaves rationally and not like these two guests of yours, if [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3488.0s)]
*  the United States behaves rationally at the negotiating table, there can be an agreement. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3494.04s)]
*  We already had an agreement, Pierce, in 2015. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3500.04s)]
*  And the Iranians were the ones that abided by the agreement. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3504.08s)]
*  And then they supported more terrorism when we gave you billions of dollars from the Obama [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3507.32s)]
*  administration. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3511.08s)]
*  Calm down. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3512.08s)]
*  You proliferated terrorism from the dollars we sent you. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3513.08s)]
*  Hey, man, why don't you just wait? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3516.72s)]
*  The Iranians abided by the nuclear deal. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3518.48s)]
*  The Iranians abided by the nuclear deal. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3522.2s)]
*  Obama violated it. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3525.2s)]
*  No, they didn't. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3526.2s)]
*  Then Trump tore up the deal. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3527.2s)]
*  And even after, Pierce, even after Trump tore up the deal. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3529.04s)]
*  We tore it up because it was a worthless deal because you guys were still sponsoring terrorism. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3531.2s)]
*  Calm down. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3536.2s)]
*  Even after Trump tore up the deal, the Iranians fully implemented the deal for a year. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3538.2799999999997s)]
*  And then for the second year, the Iranians decreased their commitment stage by stage [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3544.72s)]
*  which took another year. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3550.3599999999997s)]
*  So two years after Trump imposed maximum price sanctions, the Iranians then began to restart [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3551.8s)]
*  its nuclear program. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3559.4s)]
*  You may have no choice. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3560.4s)]
*  So who is at fault here? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3561.4s)]
*  Iran or the United States? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3562.4s)]
*  All right, we're going to leave it there. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3563.4s)]
*  It was a fiery debate. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3564.4s)]
*  Wait, let me just say. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3565.4s)]
*  Go on, Scott. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3566.4s)]
*  Quickly. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3567.4s)]
*  The professor is correct that Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, they [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3568.4s)]
*  just released their threat assessment. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3576.4s)]
*  Iran can look it up at dni.gov and their new threat assessment says Iran is not developing [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3578.4s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3583.92s)]
*  They have not made the political decision to begin to make a nuclear weapon. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3584.92s)]
*  Your other guest says that they're just such a crazy irresponsible power, but quite factually, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3589.32s)]
*  they mastered the fuel cycle. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3594.4s)]
*  Leon Panetta just said it accurately. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3595.4s)]
*  Twenty years ago. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3596.4s)]
*  They are weeks away from being able to create one. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3597.4s)]
*  Twenty years ago. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3600.4s)]
*  And they still have not. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3601.4s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Panetta, by the way. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3602.4s)]
*  They still. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3605.4s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3606.4s)]
*  They still haven't made an atom bomb, even though they've been able to for 20 years. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3607.4s)]
*  And that shows again, they have a latent nuclear deterrent and they've been so far responsible [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3611.56s)]
*  with it. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3616.96s)]
*  And we could have a new another nuclear deal and we can normalize relations with Iran. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3617.96s)]
*  It doesn't mean it's not a tyranny. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3622.82s)]
*  Why do you want to normalize? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3627.6800000000003s)]
*  Why do you want to normalize? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3628.6800000000003s)]
*  America all the time. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3629.68s)]
*  They kill American soldiers. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3635.64s)]
*  They kill American soldiers right now. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3636.64s)]
*  They do it. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3637.64s)]
*  Hang on. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3638.64s)]
*  Hang on. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3639.64s)]
*  Let me get my. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3640.64s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3641.64s)]
*  This guy's not conservative or MAGA. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3642.64s)]
*  He's a lefty. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3646.14s)]
*  I don't want him to masquerade as a conservative any longer. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3647.14s)]
*  We are not the same. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3649.8799999999997s)]
*  He's a whore. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3650.8799999999997s)]
*  Let me answer your question. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3651.8799999999997s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3652.8799999999997s)]
*  If you're a conservative, I don't want to be a conservative anymore. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3653.8799999999997s)]
*  I guess I'm assuming you're a CIA too. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3654.8799999999997s)]
*  No, you're not. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3656.08s)]
*  You're just a liberal. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3657.08s)]

*  You know what? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3659.08s)]
*  My ears. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3660.08s)]
*  I hate liberals. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3661.08s)]

*  Thank you to my panel for a spirited and lively debate. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3669.08s)]
*  And we ended on a point of mass disagreement. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3672.08s)]
*  We're going to have to end the debate. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI77VFTLrik&t=3675.08s)]
