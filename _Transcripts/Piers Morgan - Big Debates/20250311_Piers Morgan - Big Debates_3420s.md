Video Description: In the remnants of a supposed ceasefire, the fighters of Hamas and the IDF continue to engage each other and create more destruction; though with a strong advantage to the Israelis. In an effort to force Hamas to release all the remaining hostages, Israel has cut off the power supply to the Gaza strip, in a move that activists say will just mean more suffering for innocent Palestinians. Miles away, President Donald Trump has posted AI-generated video of Gaza’s reconstruction, complete with golden statues and Trump hotels. But what is actually in store for the Palestinian people seems to be a far throw from this gaudy paradise.

For a debate on the current state of affairs in Israel and Palestine, Piers Morgan is joined by ‘America’s Rabbi’ and author of 'Holocaust Holiday' Rabbi Shmuley, journalist and 'Pushback' host for The Grayzone Aaron Mate and Palestinian-American commentator Omar Baddar.

# "STOP Blaming Israel!" Rabbi Shmuley Debates Gaza With Pro-Palestinians
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394)
*  ICE has arrested the Palestinian leader of Columbia University's anti-Israel protests, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=0.0s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil. Many people think this is a violation of free speech under the First [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=5.96s)]
*  Amendment. Others think that they're perfectly entitled, this administration, to start deporting [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=11.24s)]
*  those who openly supported Hamas. What do you say about this? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=16.52s)]
*  I think that was one of the most courageous acts of moral conscience that we've seen in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  the US in many, many years. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=24.32s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=25.8s)]
*  And it outraged, it outraged the establishment. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=26.8s)]
*  The president's just shouting and yelling outside. It's all that courageous. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=27.8s)]
*  Rabbi Shmueli, an attack on free speech, many have said that. What do you say to that? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  Deport him now, because he's not promoting free speech, he's promoting incitement to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=35.36s)]
*  violence. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=39.08s)]
*  It is quite rich to hear Rabbi Shmueli. He's pretty much a three-trick pony. He's either [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=40.08s)]
*  interrupting or he's lying or he's smearing people. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=44.32s)]
*  This is what we call classic anti-Semitism. You cannot deal... [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=47.88s)]
*  I see you as the modern day followers of the Nazis. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=51.6s)]
*  Aaron, you can't seriously be saying that Rabbi Shmueli is a successor to the Nazis. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  He's a Nazi. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=61.48s)]
*  President Trump's plan to turn Gaza into a Middle Eastern Riviera, embellished with [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=64.0s)]
*  a vivid AI video featuring Elon Musk eating hummus at the beach, has certainly divided [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=68.64s)]
*  opinion, to put it mildly. More importantly, it's kick-started a serious debate about what [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=73.68s)]
*  happens to Gaza after the war. Arab leaders have now united around their own five-year, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=78.08s)]
*  $53 billion reconstruction plan that would see a temporary government of independent [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=82.84s)]
*  peacekeepers put in charge of a strip. No Palestinians would be displaced. The problem [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=87.24s)]
*  is that neither Israel nor Hamas would be involved and therefore neither of them is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=92.08s)]
*  going to accept it. Israel is currently blocking aid from entering Gaza to pressure Hamas into [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=95.72s)]
*  accepting a temporary extension of the current truce. This weekend, wrongly in my view, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=100.24s)]
*  it also cut off its supply of electricity. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=104.92s)]
*  Hamas says the second phase of the ceasefire, involving the full withdrawal of Israeli troops, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=107.2s)]
*  should begin as agreed instead. Well, to debate all this, I'm joined in the studio by America's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=111.56s)]
*  Rabbi and author of Holocaust Holiday, Rabbi Shmuley, to the journalist and pushback host [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=116.36s)]
*  for the Grey Zone, Aramate, and the Palestinian-American commentator Omar Bader. Welcome to all of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=121.6s)]
*  you. Welcome to you, Rabbi Shmuley, here in London. Let me start, if I may, with you, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=127.8s)]
*  Omar, about this. I've got to say, when I saw that Israel was yanking its power supply [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=132.48s)]
*  and fuel supply into Gaza, knowing how many innocent children have already died in Gaza [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=137.56s)]
*  during this war, many, many, many thousands, I just thought it was an act of inhumanity, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=143.76s)]
*  which Israel doesn't need to do and shouldn't have done. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=150.2s)]
*  It certainly is an act of inhumanity and one that is obviously designed not just to demonstrate [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=157.2s)]
*  dominance and bullying and increase the suffering of the people of Gaza, which has been Israel's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=162.0s)]
*  goal for a very long time, but more precisely in this moment, to try to figure out a way [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=166.16s)]
*  out of the ceasefire in which the Palestinians get blamed in some way. And what they're trying [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=170.56s)]
*  to do is provoke a response that would then justify the continuation of the slaughter. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=175.16s)]
*  And you have to pay attention to the fact that Israel has been violating the ceasefire [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  over and over again. They've killed over 100 Palestinians since the ceasefire was announced. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=182.84s)]
*  They have prevented the entry of adequate humanitarian aid, as was stipulated in the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  terms of the ceasefire agreement. And they're just looking for any way possible to try to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=193.42s)]
*  fall short on their obligations to trigger some kind of response. And it's directly in [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=198.01999999999998s)]
*  response to the fact that the entire world now seems to be moving away from Israel's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=203.66s)]
*  ethnic cleansing plan for Gaza that Trump has endorsed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  You've had this air proposal that has come together about rebuilding Gaza, endorsed by [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  many European nations, but Israel's eyes remain laser focused on the need to ethnically cleanse [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  Gaza and empty it of Palestinians. They want to finish the job of this genocide. And right [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=220.34s)]
*  now I think this is why they're pushing for these provocations. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=224.1s)]
*  Okay. Rabbi Shmueli, your response. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=226.62s)]
*  There is almost no electricity in any of the Arab world except what Israel provides Gaza. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  Syria has almost zero electricity. Lebanon goes through constant blackouts. Egypt, constant [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=234.66s)]
*  blockouts. Iraq is an oil superpower. They have no electricity. Israel has been extraordinarily [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=241.8s)]
*  kind to Gaza since 2006 when the monster murder terrorists of Hamas took over. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=248.66s)]
*  But Israel doesn't pay, doesn't give this for free. I mean, they get paid. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=253.26s)]
*  Well, it's heavily subsidised. But the real question is... [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=257.78s)]
*  Well, hang on. To be clear, Israel gets $11 million a month for supplying the power into [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=259.9s)]
*  Gaza, which is 50% or more of the power that Gaza receives in entirety. And after October [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=268.14s)]
*  a couple of weeks, Israel cut by 90% the amount of power they were sending in, and they're [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=275.7s)]
*  now cutting the remaining 10% plus the fuel. So, look, it's not an act of charity by Israel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  They get paid significant sums of money for the energy that they supply. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=287.42s)]
*  Israel has a $700 billion GDP. $11 million means absolutely nothing. This is really... [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=292.7s)]
*  It is an act of charity. And the real question is why didn't Hamas, who have been in power [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=297.96s)]
*  for 20 years, use quadruple the amount of martial aid that Europe used for Britain [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=302.46s)]
*  to rebuild their cities after the Second World War in Germany to build their own power plants? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=312.14s)]
*  Hamas stole all that money, enriched Yaya Sinwar. Do you know that Yasser Arafat's daughter [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=317.34s)]
*  was just ranked by Forbes to be worth $5 billion? This money was stolen. They should have built [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=324.34s)]
*  their own power plants. They shouldn't be dependent on Israel. This is the story of [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=329.34s)]
*  Hamas. And what I would say to my friend Omar is if you hate Israel so much and you falsely [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=332.85999999999996s)]
*  accuse it of genocide, let's imagine for one moment that Trump says to all the Jews of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=337.38s)]
*  Israel, six million, look guys, 75-year experiment of Israel, constant wars, everyone hates you, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=341.58s)]
*  move to Florida, and we're on DeSantis' pro-Israel. And I grew up in Miami, and all six million [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=346.73999999999995s)]
*  decide, you know what, let's close Israel, not through any tragic means. Tell me, Omar, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=351.29999999999995s)]
*  what then happens to the people of Gaza? Do they suddenly have liberty and democracy and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=356.78s)]
*  freedom? No. Women are still killed in honor killings by their cousins inspired by Hamas [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=360.53999999999996s)]
*  if they have a boyfriend. Gays are still castrated and hung in city squares. Gazans who want [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=365.21999999999997s)]
*  political freedom are granted none. There hasn't been one election since 2000. Take [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=371.42s)]
*  Israel out of the Middle East. And the Middle East and any country run by Islamists, the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=375.38s)]
*  Muslim Brotherhood, are still dumps where people have no human rights. Stop blaming [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=379.78s)]
*  Israel. You know the problem is not Israel. Here's proof. Because the countries in the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=384.62s)]
*  Middle East, like the Abraham Accords, so we're talking Bahrain, we're talking about [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  the UAE, we're talking Dubai, we're talking Abu Dhabi, they have brilliant economies and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  they never complain about Israel and they hate Hamas. They want to see technology. You [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=395.38s)]
*  are defending the status quo and you want the Gazans, my innocent Palestinian brothers [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=400.42s)]
*  and sisters, to serve as nothing but bargaining chips, leverage against Israel. Why would you [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=406.26s)]
*  want them to stay in that hovel, in that dump? I have been in Gaza, have you? I was in Gaza [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=411.06s)]
*  before the war. I was there in 2001 with Reverend Al Sharpton. It was a dump then. Why won't [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=416.94s)]
*  you allow the Gazans to have a plebiscite, to have a referendum? Let them decide where [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=421.98s)]
*  they want to live, if they can live in Jordan or if they can live in Saudi Arabia with a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=426.18s)]
*  garden rather than you deciding that they should be bargaining chips against Israel. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=430.02000000000004s)]
*  Let me go to Aaron, the respond first. Omar, I'll come back to you. But Aaron, your response [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=435.74s)]
*  to that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=439.7s)]
*  The first one is to opt out of the chaos and invest in something solid and reliable, physical, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=469.7s)]
*  gold and silver. And there's only one name you need to remember, American Heart for Gold. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=474.7s)]

*  There's a lot to respond to. There was an election in Gaza. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=535.7800000000001s)]
*  2006. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=541.58s)]
*  The people of, yes. And what happened was. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=542.58s)]
*  20 years ago there was an election for four years. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=544.58s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=546.58s)]
*  And they haven't allowed an election. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=547.58s)]
*  Let us speak. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=548.58s)]
*  I didn't interrupt you. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=549.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=550.58s)]
*  There was an election. The people in the West Bank and Gaza voted for Hamas and had Israel [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=551.58s)]
*  and the U.S. respond. Not being generous to Gaza as Rabbi Shmueli falsely claimed. Putting [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=556.58s)]
*  it under an inhumane crippling siege. Depriving it of all the basics people needed to survive. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=561.38s)]
*  Even certain types of hummus were banned from entering Gaza under Israeli rule. That's the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=567.74s)]
*  benevolent Israeli occupation that Rabbi Shmueli wants us to believe in. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=572.1800000000001s)]
*  The reason why Hamas turned to armed resistance against Israel on October 7th is because they [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=576.74s)]
*  tried all other means. When Palestinians launched the Great March of Return in 2018, tens of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=580.54s)]
*  thousands of people marching peacefully, they were gunned down by Israeli snipers. When [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=586.46s)]
*  Hamas leaders accepted the Arab League peace proposal of a two state solution, accepting [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=590.5s)]
*  just 22% of Palestine, their historic homeland, Israel said they wouldn't even discuss it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=596.1s)]
*  So that answers the question of why Hamas has turned to armed resistance because when [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=601.54s)]
*  they've tried to pursue the diplomatic path, Israel has ignored them. And that's the fundamental [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=604.8s)]
*  problem here. Rabbi Shmueli mentioned countries in the region that don't have electricity, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=609.64s)]
*  whereas the other regions, whereas other countries thrive. Well, all those countries that Rabbi [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=613.8s)]
*  Shmueli mentioned, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, they share another thing in common with the Palestinians. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=618.6999999999999s)]
*  They've been relentlessly attacked by U.S. Israeli aggression for years. The Iraq War, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=623.3199999999999s)]
*  for example. Syria, Israel's stolen. The Golan Heights is currently stealing more territory [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=628.88s)]
*  today. Lebanon, Israel invades in 1982, kills tens of thousands of people, occupied it for [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=633.8s)]
*  many years, recently undertook a new round of massacres. So if Rabbi Shmueli cared about [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=638.68s)]
*  the people of the region and all Israel apologists, what they would simply do is say, for the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=643.52s)]
*  first time in our history, we're actually going to accept the right of Palestinians [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=647.24s)]
*  to have their own land, not come up with these fantasies of ethnic cleansing, which Israel [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=651.16s)]
*  has tried to do since its founding in 1948, say we're actually going to recognize the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=656.04s)]
*  rights of Palestinians to have self-determination, which everybody in this world has. And the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=660.32s)]
*  reason why they don't accept that is because they're a Jewish supremacist state founded [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=664.48s)]
*  on this idea that Jews are superior, have a biblical right to all this land. And that's [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=668.6s)]
*  why they're pursuing their current path. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you this. On this issue of power, for example, electricity, I've explained [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=674.6400000000001s)]
*  how the process works. So Israel supplies more than half of Gaza's power. They get $11 [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=680.96s)]
*  million a month from the Palestinian Authority, which is gained from tax revenue from Palestinians. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=685.52s)]
*  So it's a quid pro quo, if you like. But as we look forward here, my question, and I think [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=691.36s)]
*  it's a perfectly good one from Rabbi Shmueli there, is Hamas were given billions of dollars. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=698.92s)]
*  Over six billion is reported to have been given. And they could have gone one of many [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=704.66s)]
*  ways with that money. They could have built a more prosperous Gaza if they wanted to. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=710.0s)]
*  But instead, they spent or squandered that money on effectively building a terror network [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=715.44s)]
*  amongst the civilian population and then unleashing hell on October the 7th against the people [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  of Israel. What they didn't do was make Gaza self-sufficient for energy or water or anything [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=728.36s)]
*  else. And my question would be, well, why didn't they? And as a result of that, what's [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=735.84s)]
*  your view of what's now happened? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=742.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, my answer is they were not allowed to. Israel subjected Gaza under Hamas's control [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=745.32s)]
*  to a criminal blockade, preventing the very reconstruction materials that Gaza would need [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=750.4399999999999s)]
*  to build the electricity. They bombed Gaza's power plants, took it offline. They've destroyed [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=755.52s)]
*  the water infrastructure well before October 7th. The basics that Gazans need to live have [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=761.16s)]
*  been denied to them. An Israeli minister famously said, we're going to put the people of Gaza [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=766.0s)]
*  on a diet, by which he meant, we're going to allow in just enough food so that people [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=769.92s)]
*  can survive without a full blown starvation crisis. But they're going to be hungry. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=773.9599999999999s)]
*  So if you want to know why Gaza has not built up the infrastructure that it needs to [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  survive, the answer is the Israeli occupation. Even before October 7th, the UN was warning [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=782.88s)]
*  that within a few years, Gaza would not be livable because of the inhumanity of the siege. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=788.0799999999999s)]
*  So there's your answer. You can criticize Hamas. There's plenty to criticize there. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=793.64s)]
*  My friends who live in Gaza are not fans of Hamas. They would love to have somebody [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=797.24s)]
*  different. But I'm not going to hold occupied people accountable for the crimes of their [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=800.6s)]
*  occupiers. And unless you understand that Gaza has been subjected to a criminal blockade [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=806.08s)]
*  as part of one of the world's longest running and cruelest military occupations in the [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=810.9200000000001s)]
*  world, we're not going to be able to resolve this conflict. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=814.9200000000001s)]
*  Right. And Rabbi Shmuley, I mean, the clear reality, surely, is that unless you afford [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=817.32s)]
*  Palestinians the same basic human rights as their Israeli neighbors, you are never going [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=822.44s)]
*  to have peace in that region ever. Why would you? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=827.68s)]
*  Why have one group of people, millions, are deprived the same basic fundamental human [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=831.0s)]
*  rights across a border as their neighbors? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=836.64s)]
*  Why would they not always want to resist that? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=839.5999999999999s)]
*  First of all, they were granted complete human rights. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=842.7199999999999s)]
*  Israel enacted a total and complete military and civilian withdrawal from Gucukhatif, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=845.52s)]
*  Gaza, 2005. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=851.3199999999999s)]
*  My children were some of the last, we know we're Americans, last children to actually [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=853.12s)]
*  plant trees on a Jewish holiday. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=858.0400000000001s)]
*  They were cut down by Hamas later because all of this was used. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=862.2s)]
*  Everything was used in order to attack Israel. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=865.44s)]
*  My issue with Aaron is that there's a difference between opinion and fact. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=867.96s)]
*  Aaron, I say respectfully, I think that you have really permanently undermined your [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=871.44s)]
*  credibility by just such a stream of fabrication that it defies imagination. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=875.48s)]
*  Did you really just say that the Palestinians only got 22 percent of the mandated [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=881.76s)]
*  Palestine? You know it's the exact opposite. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=886.84s)]
*  No, I didn't say that. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=889.0s)]
*  No, no, no. You said I shouldn't interrupt you, so you won't interrupt me. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=889.76s)]
*  Thank you. I appreciate your respect. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=892.92s)]
*  Well, he's disputing you said it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=894.92s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=896.04s)]
*  You did say it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=896.4s)]
*  Well, what did he say? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=897.16s)]
*  Hang on. Let's just clarify. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=897.9599999999999s)]
*  I said that the Arab League offered Israel a huge compromise for Palestinians in which [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=899.56s)]
*  Palestinians would accept just 22 percent of their historic homeland. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=905.96s)]
*  OK, let's go to the facts. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=909.24s)]
*  Let's go to the facts. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=910.52s)]
*  The facts are, no, no, you won't interrupt me please because I didn't interrupt you. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=911.52s)]
*  Please. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=914.56s)]
*  Listen, why don't you finish interrupting me and when you're finished, then I'll continue. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=915.36s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=918.96s)]
*  Finish interrupting me. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=919.36s)]
*  I answered your question. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=921.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=922.64s)]
*  So let me continue. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=923.0s)]
*  Everyone knows that Winston Churchill actually wrote that on a Sunday afternoon, he created [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=924.68s)]
*  the nation of Transjordan. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=931.6s)]
*  He was the colonial secretary. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=933.3199999999999s)]
*  He cut off 80 percent of the Balfour Declaration, 1917, biblically mandated Palestine, and he [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=934.68s)]
*  gave it to Jordan. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=943.16s)]
*  It was a reward for people who don't live there, the Hashemites. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=944.1999999999999s)]
*  He brought King Abdullah and his brother, King Faisal. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=947.68s)]
*  Faisal was kicked out of Syria. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=950.48s)]
*  They tried. Then Abdullah was killed in Jordan. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=952.24s)]
*  Somehow the Hashemites, you know, continue there till this very day. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=955.0799999999999s)]
*  They're not native Jordanians. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=957.8s)]
*  You and I both know that. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=959.24s)]
*  They cut off 80 percent of the Jewish homeland and created Transjordan. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=960.4s)]
*  That is a fact, Winston Churchill. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=964.12s)]
*  Now let's go on. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=966.6s)]
*  Even then, with the 20 percent left. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=968.0s)]
*  It's not the Jewish homeland. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=970.28s)]
*  No, no, no, you're interrupting me again because you don't want to hear facts, but you're [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=970.72s)]
*  going to hear these facts and then when I finish, I won't interrupt you. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=973.4s)]
*  How about that? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=976.28s)]
*  Okay, sure. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=977.4s)]
*  Let's have a civil dialogue. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=977.6s)]
*  1936, you say that in 1936, the Peel Commission launched by the British was because of Arab [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=978.92s)]
*  violence before there was even a Jewish state. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=984.88s)]
*  It started with an Arab blockade and a boycott and then it became full violence. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=987.0s)]
*  So they sent the Peel Commission and the Peel Commission divided the country into two [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=991.36s)]
*  and the Arabs rejected it. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=994.88s)]
*  Then November 1927 in the Queen's Museum, which I drive by whenever I land in LaGuardia [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=996.32s)]
*  Airport or JFK. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1003.08s)]
*  That was the UN headquarters. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1004.36s)]
*  They voted again a partition plan where the Jews got a tiny bit of that 20 percent. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1005.5600000000001s)]
*  The Arabs rejected it, launched two wars 1947, 1948, 1956. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1009.5600000000001s)]
*  Israel withdrew completely from the Stein, which they conquered 1967 after they conquered [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1014.24s)]
*  everything that we're debating right now. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1019.32s)]
*  They went, Moshe Dayan, the defense minister, went to the Arabs and said, we want to give [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1021.1600000000001s)]
*  it all back. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1024.6000000000001s)]
*  They went to Khartoum and they responded with the three no's. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1025.1200000000001s)]
*  No to recognition, no peace and no legitimacy. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1027.48s)]
*  These are all facts. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1031.04s)]
*  You can destroy your credibility as a scholar if you wish. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1032.1200000000001s)]
*  Finally, Ayud Olmert offered them 96 percent of the West Bank and they rejected it. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1034.76s)]
*  And then Bill Clinton, who we Jews don't really consider a great friend of Israel, wrote in [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1039.96s)]
*  his memoirs that he told Arafat, I am a failure and you are the reason I'm a failure. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1044.04s)]
*  We gave you everything. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1049.64s)]
*  Now, finally, one final point appears when you ask me a very valid question. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1050.6s)]
*  Why should the Palestinians not resist when they're given full rights? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1055.76s)]
*  There are no soldiers in Gaza. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1059.56s)]
*  Israel dismantled its own communities. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1061.9199999999998s)]
*  They use their soldiers to break down houses of my wife's cousins. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1064.9599999999998s)]
*  And then Aaron says there was a blockade and they could build anything. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1070.7199999999998s)]
*  How did they build an underground network larger than the London tube that I just took [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1074.48s)]
*  to get here? If there was a blockade, the London tube is pretty impressive. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1079.84s)]
*  Do you know that Hamas used the hundreds of billions of dollars they got not to build [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1084.1599999999999s)]
*  one bomb shelter, not one electricity plant, which could have answered Pierce's issue [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1089.52s)]
*  about they used it all to build a terror network for their fighters and then use babies [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1094.48s)]
*  and every time you say about about Jewish supremacy, I want to say that on a crippled [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1101.08s)]
*  deal with the Yom Kippur beard, I think I believe is a Jew that God loves every child [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1104.4399999999998s)]
*  as much as a Jew. And everyone that died is because of Hamas. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1109.6s)]
*  OK, Hamas. Thank you. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1112.6s)]
*  OK, Omar, what do you respond to that? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1114.12s)]
*  Sure. I mean, first, it is quite rich to hear Rabbi Shmueli complain about anybody [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1118.4399999999998s)]
*  interrupting. He's pretty much a three trick pony. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1122.9599999999998s)]
*  He's either interrupting or he's lying or he's smearing people ad hominem. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1125.12s)]
*  Are you really going to get into ad hominem this early in the debate? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1130.08s)]
*  You really have to personalize it. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1133.04s)]
*  Deal with the facts, please. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1134.3999999999999s)]
*  There is the first trick. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1135.4399999999998s)]
*  Stop the ad hominem attack. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1136.24s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1137.32s)]
*  He's demonstrating it. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1137.8s)]
*  Please don't do the ad hominem trick for you right now. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1138.72s)]
*  In fact, fears, frankly, if your audience watching at home or playing a drinking game [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1141.8s)]
*  in which they took a shot every time he either lied or interrupted, half of your [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1146.04s)]
*  audience would be dead before this is just ad hominem. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1149.76s)]
*  Do you know facts or not? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1152.24s)]
*  You want to debate fact or do you want to insult me? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1153.52s)]
*  Are you going to keep interrupting? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1156.32s)]
*  Are you going to keep complaining about interrupting? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1157.52s)]
*  Do you want to debate me? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1159.28s)]
*  Are you going to demonstrate your hypocrisy to everyone? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1160.6799999999998s)]
*  Here we go. Hypocrisy, liar. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1163.0s)]
*  We know what you think about Jews. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1164.84s)]
*  Debate the facts. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1166.2s)]
*  Forget the evil me and debate the facts. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1167.4s)]
*  Unbelievable level of hypocrisy. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1169.52s)]
*  You are demonstrating your hypocrisy right now by continually interrupting. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1171.6000000000001s)]
*  Stop the insults. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1174.6000000000001s)]
*  Try and stop. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1175.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'll set the insults if that's even possible with dealing with people like you. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1178.2800000000002s)]
*  Now, Rabbi Shmueli actually fully understands that the reason why there's no electricity in Gaza is because Israel. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1182.44s)]
*  Can you be quiet? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1189.5600000000002s)]
*  Can you be quiet and let me finish what I have to say. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1190.8000000000002s)]
*  Rabbi Shmueli knows extremely well that the reason why there is no electricity in Gaza [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1193.44s)]
*  is because Israel bombs the infrastructure in Gaza and then puts Gaza under siege [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1197.12s)]
*  and does not allow Palestinians to rebuild their own power plants. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1201.36s)]
*  They've created a situation of dependence where Gaza cannot survive on its own economically. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1204.4399999999998s)]
*  It has to depend on Israel. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1209.6s)]
*  And that is by design because Israel wants to be able to shut off the electricity at any point. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1211.04s)]
*  Rabbi Shmueli knows this, but he tries to play on the uninformed audiences. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1215.8799999999999s)]
*  He takes them for fools and hopes that they won't be able to see through the idiocy that he's actually demonstrating right now. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1220.08s)]
*  Phenomenal. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1225.56s)]
*  Hypocrite idiot. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1226.12s)]
*  Hypocrite idiot. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1226.76s)]
*  Come on, any other insults? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1227.6s)]
*  Have you got a thesaurus in front of you? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1229.0s)]
*  Why don't you just Google more personal insults? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1230.4799999999998s)]
*  You can't deal with a single historical fact that I said. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1235.12s)]
*  So you've called me an idiot, hypocrite, a liar. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1237.84s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1240.08s)]
*  See, this is what we call classic anti-Semitism. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1240.9199999999998s)]
*  You think your narrative is made up of facts? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1243.12s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1244.8799999999999s)]
*  I quoted to you the Peel Commission, the UN, the Omer deal. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1245.6s)]
*  You cannot respond to a single one. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1250.0s)]
*  So what do you have to do? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1251.9199999999998s)]
*  At hominem, at hominem, at hominem. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1253.0s)]
*  Deal with me as a person and try to suppress your hatred for Jews. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1255.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1259.2s)]
*  Yes, quiet down. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1260.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, again, the smear of anti-Semitism. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1261.8400000000001s)]
*  That's the second trick. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1263.64s)]
*  Really, if people are taking shots, I mean, try to keep track of how much alcohol they're consuming at this point. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1264.8400000000001s)]
*  So the reason why there has not been a Palestinian state, and by the way, if you're going to pull up Bill Clinton, that's fine. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1269.0s)]
*  By all means, why don't you try pulling up Jimmy Carter, who's been very clear about the fact that the reason why there has not been a resolution to this conflict is because Israel insists on maintaining an illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1274.76s)]
*  And denies Palestinians any freedom. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1285.6s)]
*  And so you hear, Shmueli here claiming that Israel allows Palestinians to be completely free and have full rights. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1287.6399999999999s)]
*  But that is belied by every single major human rights organization in the entire world. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1292.6799999999998s)]
*  And so Shmueli was basically saying that you have to believe him and Israeli propagandists when it comes to the issue of human rights, instead of believing our own eyes, instead of believing major human rights organizations and actually documented facts of what is unfolding on the ground. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1297.24s)]
*  And that is that Palestinians have no freedom, no dignity, no opportunity, all due to Israel squeezing them under a brutal occupation and looking for ways to get rid of them. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1311.36s)]
*  That is at the core of the so-called conflict. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1320.8s)]
*  OK, let me ask you, Ravash Shmueli, a different question, which is that it has been reported that Trump envoy to the Middle East is in direct talks now with Hamas. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1323.04s)]
*  Should the White House be directly negotiating with a prescribed terror group in this way? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1333.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, I want to know whether the official hostage negotiator, Adam Boller, has gone rogue or whether these are under orders of our elected president, who has the mandate of the people, having won the popular vote, the electoral college vote. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1339.28s)]
*  Because what Adam Boller said yesterday, I think it was on CNN, was shocking. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1350.32s)]
*  He not only went rogue and started speaking to Hamas when the president had tweeted two days earlier, giving Hamas a binary choice. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1355.64s)]
*  Release the hostages or face hell and every one of your fighters will be killed. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1363.6s)]
*  And he said that he would give Netanyahu everything that he needed. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1367.48s)]
*  The president wrote this himself on Truth Social in order to annihilate every Hamas fighter, every terrorist dedicated to a second genocide, to a second Holocaust. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1369.68s)]
*  Suddenly, Boller comes along, goes behind the scenes. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1380.56s)]
*  And by the way, Pierce, may I say he criticized my dear friend Ron Dermer, who was my, you probably know I was a rabbi at Oxford University for 11 years. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1382.8400000000001s)]
*  Ron Dermer was my student president. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1389.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm one of the people who inspired him to move to Israel. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1390.64s)]
*  He's now chief negotiator for the hostages. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1392.52s)]
*  He criticized Ron by name, which was very unfair. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1396.3999999999999s)]
*  And then he said Hamas aren't such bad people. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1398.6399999999999s)]
*  They don't have horns. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1400.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, it's like saying, you know, Hitler was nice to his dog. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1401.6399999999999s)]
*  I've heard that too. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1404.36s)]
*  When you have a genocidal organization whose actual charter says that we are dedicated, not just to killing Rabbi Shmueli and all the IDF soldiers and all the women they gang raped. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1405.3999999999999s)]
*  I was in the killing fields of Gaza 10 days after the bodies were still there. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1415.32s)]
*  The stench of death was still there. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1419.52s)]
*  When he says that they don't have horns and that they're nice people, you give them a degree of legitimacy, which is shocking. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1421.44s)]
*  Imagine if people in Britain during the Second World War, knowing the blitz and then they found out about the extermination camps and what was done even to British prisoners of war, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1428.16s)]
*  suddenly heard that the Nazis aren't such bad people. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1436.0400000000002s)]
*  In fact, I met with them in Himmler. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1438.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, we had tea, et cetera. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1439.3200000000002s)]
*  That would be very offensive. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1440.68s)]
*  And then he said America is not a client state of Israel. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1441.88s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1445.0800000000002s)]
*  Does Adam Bowler not realize that he is a Jewish American? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1446.0s)]
*  Is someone who Hamas also says in their charter they're going to kill? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1448.96s)]
*  Let me quote the charter verbatim. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1452.16s)]
*  The time will come when trees will call out and say, come, Muslim, there is a Jew hiding behind me. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1454.1200000000001s)]
*  Come and kill him. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1461.64s)]
*  That includes Adam Bowler, includes his wife, includes his children. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1462.3200000000002s)]
*  So when you say that these people are human, I'm sorry, there's no genocidal organization, which is human. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1464.8400000000001s)]
*  When Adam says to me, hey, they were elected in 2000, there was an election. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1469.0s)]
*  Adam, are you freaking kidding me? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1473.3200000000002s)]
*  You mean if Trump decides to abolish elections in 2028, you're going to be OK with it? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1475.08s)]
*  If he says that he's going to go in 20 years to elections, you're making a mockery of democracy. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1480.28s)]
*  And don't tell me it was a fair election. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1484.72s)]
*  Hamas took it was an election between the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Hamas, who hates Hamas, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1486.6s)]
*  who hasn't visited Gaza in 20 years because he would be killed probably even more than I would. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1491.9199999999998s)]
*  They took the Palestinian Authority candidates and they threw them off rooftops. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1497.6799999999998s)]
*  They killed them. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1503.84s)]
*  And by the way, I haven't heard either of you say a single word you said about Syria. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1505.28s)]
*  Adam, you said that Israel stole the Golanites. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1509.8799999999999s)]
*  His name's Aaron, not Adam. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1511.76s)]
*  Aaron, I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It was not intentional. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1512.8s)]
*  I'm so sorry. Forgive me. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1515.0s)]
*  And it's a beautiful biblical name. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1516.28s)]
*  We'll connect on that. I hope you'll forgive me. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1517.76s)]
*  Aaron. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1519.4399999999998s)]
*  Adam's also a nice, beautiful name, but Aaron's a better name. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1521.4399999999998s)]
*  Good biblical name. Moses' brother. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1523.9599999999998s)]
*  You're a high priest. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1525.6399999999999s)]
*  Did you really tell me that Israel stole the Golanites? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1527.48s)]
*  Did you really want Assad to have it while he was gassing Arab children with mustard, sarin gas, with poison gas? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1532.3999999999999s)]
*  Do you want Al Julani to have it right now? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1539.6799999999998s)]
*  Did you watch the videos of what Al Julani did to the Alawites over the past week? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1544.76s)]
*  Have any of you seen a single demonstration? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1549.4799999999998s)]
*  They took Arab men and shot them in the fricking head and then learning from Hamas posted it all on Instagram [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1552.3999999999999s)]
*  and on X and you guys haven't said one word. You know why? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1561.56s)]
*  Because you don't really care about Arab law. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1564.4s)]
*  You care about demonized Jews. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1565.72s)]
*  Why do we let them get a word in anyways? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1567.44s)]
*  I think Aaron has said something about this. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1569.32s)]
*  Let Aaron respond to that because I think you have been saying things about it. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1571.0s)]
*  Just an historical point. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1575.8s)]
*  Israel stole the Golanites in 1967, long before Bashar al-Assad was in power. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1576.72s)]
*  His father was. His father was in power. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1584.68s)]
*  Let him speak, please. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1586.56s)]
*  Okay. If Rabbi Shmueli is upset with the atrocities currently being committed, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1587.6s)]
*  he's right, by this al-Qaeda offshoot that now rules Syria. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1592.96s)]
*  He should be criticizing governments like Israel and the US, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1596.84s)]
*  which took credit for this former al-Qaeda leader taking power. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1601.04s)]
*  Netanyahu, after Assad was overthrown, gave a grand speech saying, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1605.0s)]
*  we deserve credit for this because it was our crushing of Syrian allies Hezbollah. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1608.6399999999999s)]
*  Plus, by the way, the hundreds of Israeli airstrikes on Syria over the years [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1613.08s)]
*  and also arming insurgent groups that helped bring about Assad's fall. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1616.72s)]
*  So if you're upset about that, Rabbi Shmueli, take it up with Netanyahu, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1620.1200000000001s)]
*  openly took credit for helping bring about the ouster of Assad. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1623.4s)]
*  Now, I want to say something now. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1628.28s)]
*  I'm not a religious person, so I can't claim to be a devout Jew. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1629.6000000000001s)]
*  But I got to say, Rabbi Shmueli, you don't speak for me. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1634.44s)]
*  Accusing people like my friend Omar of anti-Semitism [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1637.68s)]
*  simply because he wants the freedom of his people, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1640.6000000000001s)]
*  it saddens me to see what people like you have done to the Jewish tradition. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1643.2s)]
*  The suffering of my family, my great grandparents, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1647.4s)]
*  perished in the Holocaust, they were murdered by the Nazis. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1649.92s)]
*  And today, I have to tell you, I see you as the modern day followers of the Nazis, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1652.48s)]
*  supporting this mass murder campaign in Gaza, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1658.72s)]
*  putting the people of Gaza in what even Israelis have called a concentration camp. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1662.1200000000001s)]
*  It's the Israeli Jews of today, supported by American Jews, unfortunately, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1667.1200000000001s)]
*  but there are certainly some that are following in the footsteps of our oppressors. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1670.92s)]
*  And I hope one day you can connect to your own humanity [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1674.7600000000002s)]
*  and the very best of your own tradition, which I believe in, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1678.0400000000002s)]
*  to see just how horrible this modern state, this modern supremacist state, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1682.2s)]
*  is not only for the Palestinians, but the Jewish people as well. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1687.44s)]
*  Aaron, you can't seriously be saying that Rabbi Shmueli, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1689.48s)]
*  one of the most high profile Jews in the world, is a successor to the Nazis. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1693.5200000000002s)]
*  Is a Nazi. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1697.7600000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's a pretty despicable... I am saying that. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1698.7600000000002s)]
*  That's a pretty despicable thing to say, isn't it? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1700.36s)]
*  He supports the mass murder of children in a concentration camp. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1702.76s)]
*  What else am I supposed to... [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1706.12s)]
*  Can I... May I respond to that? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1707.12s)]
*  I think you should respond to that. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1708.9199999999998s)]
*  These are Nazi tactics. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1710.12s)]
*  Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1711.12s)]
*  Notice I have not once offended, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1713.36s)]

*  Excuse me. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1727.36s)]
*  Omar started calling me a liar. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1728.72s)]
*  He wouldn't deal with any facts. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1731.4s)]
*  A hypocrite. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1732.88s)]
*  He said I'm drunk on lies, etc., etc. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1733.88s)]

*  I've seen it whenever... And I debate everybody, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1739.64s)]

*  And I helped get them out. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1774.72s)]
*  And the reason why the Israeli military wanted the kids out [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1776.2s)]
*  but not their accompanying attendants [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1778.76s)]

*  a grandfather, that sort of terrorist. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1783.76s)]

*  I will state unequivocally that this Nazi believes [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1851.24s)]
*  that every Arab life is absolutely equal [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1854.48s)]

*  You know who took us in? The Muslims. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1876.56s)]
*  That's why there are Jewish communities in Istanbul [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1878.32s)]

*  The Muslims saved us. We will never forget it. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1885.08s)]
*  Islam, we only know about Aristotle and Plato's Socrates. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1887.56s)]
*  The Catholic Church saw them as pagan philosophers [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1890.72s)]
*  and burned their books. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1893.12s)]
*  It was Muslims who created the first... [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1894.36s)]
*  So, Omar, will you make the same statement? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1897.28s)]
*  Is Judaism as great a world religion [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1899.36s)]
*  and equal before God as Islam, yes or no? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1901.72s)]
*  That goes without saying. For the record, by the way, I'm agnostic. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1906.4s)]
*  But, yes, I have no trouble acknowledging the fact that... [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1909.28s)]
*  But thank you, I appreciate that. So we're making some progress. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1911.72s)]
*  Well, let me ask Omar... [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1914.04s)]
*  Let me ask you a different question. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1915.44s)]
*  Would you endorse what Aaron said, though, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1918.8s)]
*  that Rabbi Shmueli is a successor to the Nazis? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1921.64s)]
*  I'm a Nazi. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1924.92s)]
*  Look, I'm personally... [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1927.44s)]
*  I mean, between Aaron and Rabbi Shmueli, they're both Jewish. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1929.24s)]
*  I feel like there's more comfort in invoking that language. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1932.0s)]
*  I personally don't really care much for Nazi analogies. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1934.28s)]
*  But I will point out that Rabbi Shmueli is the one [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1937.1200000000001s)]
*  who invoked the Nazi analogy first in talking about Gaza. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1939.24s)]
*  And I just want to say that if what you're doing is defending a government [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1942.2s)]
*  that is credibly accused of genocide by every major human rights organization [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1945.8s)]
*  in the world... [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1950.0s)]
*  Like whom? What do you mean, genocide? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1951.0s)]
*  Do you know the definition of genocide? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1952.76s)]
*  International Criminal Court. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1955.16s)]
*  Who coined the word genocide? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1956.16s)]
*  Can I finish my sentence? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1957.16s)]
*  Yes, please, forgive me. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1958.16s)]
*  I will never let anybody else finish a sentence [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1960.1200000000001s)]
*  while complaining about interrupting a longer... [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1962.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, let's stop the ad-haman. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1963.1200000000001s)]
*  I apologize. Go ahead, please. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1964.1200000000001s)]
*  The Israeli government is credibly accused of committing genocide [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1965.1200000000001s)]
*  in a concentration camp in Gaza. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1969.0800000000002s)]
*  If we're talking about sectarian violence, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1971.3600000000001s)]
*  there is no greater sectarian violence than the fact that you have people [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1972.96s)]
*  between Netanyahu talking about the Amalek, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1976.3600000000001s)]
*  between the Israeli soldiers celebrating this genocide on TikTok. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1978.92s)]
*  You can read endless statements from them. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1982.24s)]
*  If that's what you're supporting, the massacring of people [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1984.2s)]
*  in a concentration camp, you probably should be the last person [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1986.24s)]
*  to invoke Nazi analogies. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1989.24s)]
*  So then I am a Nazi, like Aaron said. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1990.24s)]
*  OK, I get it. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1992.24s)]
*  And when we talk about Syria, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1993.24s)]
*  when we talk about Syria, there's no question [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1996.24s)]
*  that the current government is engaged in unspeakable atrocities [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=1999.24s)]
*  against Alawites and other minorities. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2002.24s)]
*  There's no question that the previous government under Assad [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2004.24s)]
*  was also a brutal and repressive government [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2006.24s)]
*  that is engaged in endless atrocities. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2008.24s)]
*  But none of this changes the fact that it does not allow Israel [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2010.24s)]
*  to take Syrian territory because there are atrocities [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2013.28s)]
*  being committed in Syria. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2016.28s)]
*  And there is universal agreement under international law [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2017.28s)]
*  that the Golan Heights is Syrian territory [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2020.28s)]
*  that Israel is illegally occupying. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2023.28s)]
*  This is simply uncontroversial. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2025.28s)]
*  And starting to talk about random atrocities being committed in Syria [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2027.28s)]
*  as a way to justify that occupation [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2030.28s)]
*  is just an attempt to pull the wool over people's eyes. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2032.28s)]
*  OK. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2035.28s)]
*  Can I respond just in a way? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2036.28s)]
*  Well, actually, look... [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2038.28s)]
*  I want to get some other stuff in. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2039.28s)]
*  Can I just get the genocide in for one second? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2041.32s)]
*  Very quickly. Very quickly. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2043.32s)]
*  Omar, do you know what genocide means, the exact definition? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2045.32s)]
*  I do. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2049.32s)]
*  The destruction of a people in whole or in part. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2050.32s)]
*  And every major human rights organization... [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2052.32s)]
*  No, no, that's not what it means. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2054.32s)]
*  Genocide is a term... [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2056.32s)]
*  May I respond? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2057.32s)]
*  Genocide is a term that was coined by a Holocaust survivor, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2058.32s)]
*  a lawyer named Raphael Lemkin. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2061.32s)]
*  Geno is an ethnicity. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2063.32s)]
*  Side is mass murder. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2064.32s)]
*  It is the intentional mass murder of an ethnicity. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2066.32s)]
*  Now, if Israel was guilty of genocide, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2068.32s)]
*  the first people they would have killed [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2070.36s)]
*  is all the Arab Muslim citizens [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2071.36s)]
*  who are defenseless, living in Nazareth, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2073.36s)]
*  living in Jaffa, living in Haifa. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2075.36s)]
*  And, in fact, everyone thought [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2077.36s)]
*  that they may even rise up against Israel after October 7. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2079.36s)]
*  They are so content to be Israeli citizens [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2081.36s)]
*  there wasn't one uprising [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2083.36s)]
*  because they love being Israeli citizens. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2085.36s)]
*  That's the first thing. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2086.36s)]
*  Genocide, you don't even know what it means, respectfully. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2087.36s)]
*  I'm not saying that it's ad hominem. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2089.36s)]
*  You just know what it means. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2090.36s)]
*  Number two, if Israel is guilty of genocide, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2091.36s)]
*  Israel has nuclear weapons. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2093.36s)]
*  Israel has... Israel could have flattened... [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2095.36s)]
*  So, even according to Hamas numbers, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2097.36s)]
*  about 47,000 people have died in Gaza [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2099.4s)]
*  since the beginning of the war. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2102.4s)]
*  Let's assume that's, you know, Hamas health... [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2103.4s)]
*  Let's assume they're true. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2105.4s)]
*  Israel and Hamas both essentially say [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2107.4s)]
*  that it's about a one-to-one... [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2110.4s)]
*  Israel even admits more than Hamas. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2111.4s)]
*  Israel says it might be a one-to-one-point-two [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2113.4s)]
*  of combatant to civilian deaths. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2115.4s)]
*  Do you know what Winston Churchill was guilty of [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2119.4s)]
*  in the Second World War? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2122.4s)]
*  One to four. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2123.4s)]
*  So you'll say that was not precision, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2124.4s)]
*  but it's not true, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2125.4s)]
*  because Churchill bombed at night [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2126.4s)]
*  because he didn't care about how many civilians [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2128.44s)]
*  he was killing, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2130.44s)]
*  and the Americans used a special locator. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2131.44s)]
*  They only did precision bombing during the day. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2134.44s)]
*  America and Mosul under President Obama. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2136.44s)]
*  That was a one-to-four combatant to civilian ratio. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2139.44s)]
*  I could go on. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2142.44s)]
*  Israel has the lowest civilian to casualty ratio [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2143.44s)]
*  in modern times. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2146.44s)]
*  And finally, you're speaking about the most densely [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2147.44s)]
*  populated place on Earth. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2149.44s)]
*  So, given that... Given that... [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2150.44s)]
*  No, that's not true. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2153.44s)]
*  Let me just finish, please. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2154.44s)]
*  Given that Saddam Hussein killed eight people [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2155.44s)]
*  and Saddam Hussein killed 800,000 Arabs. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2157.48s)]
*  Given that Bashar al-Assad killed 600,000 Arabs. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2160.48s)]
*  And given that even according to Hamas, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2164.48s)]
*  Israel killed 47,000, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2166.48s)]
*  and half are... [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2167.48s)]
*  And every one of them was too many, by the way. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2168.48s)]
*  They're all Hamas' fault. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2170.48s)]
*  And half are combatants. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2171.48s)]
*  So you're telling me the 23,000 [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2172.48s)]
*  who are only killed as they live [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2174.48s)]
*  because Hamas puts their bases, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2177.48s)]
*  their army bases in kindergartens [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2179.48s)]
*  and in nurseries and in hospitals, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2181.48s)]
*  that's a genocide? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2183.48s)]
*  That's the purpose of targeting of an ethnicity? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2184.52s)]
*  Read about Raphael Lemkin. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2187.52s)]
*  He was a hero. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2188.52s)]
*  He got the 1948 anti-genocide agreement [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2189.52s)]
*  to which 183 nations are party to. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2193.52s)]
*  And by the way, to all my Irish friends [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2195.52s)]
*  who are watching who accuse Israel of genocide, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2198.52s)]
*  Ireland signed a document that said [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2200.52s)]
*  that if a genocide is going on, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2202.52s)]
*  they have to accept all those people guilty of it. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2203.52s)]
*  I'm sorry, suffering under... into Ireland. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2205.52s)]
*  Do you know that Ireland hasn't taken [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2207.52s)]
*  one Palestinian refugee? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2209.52s)]
*  You know that Britain hasn't taken, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2211.52s)]
*  I think, 100 refugees? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2212.56s)]
*  If it's a genocide, why aren't you clamouring [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2214.56s)]
*  for all the nations to finally take them in? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2216.56s)]
*  Because you don't really believe it. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2219.56s)]
*  OK, let me go to... [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2221.56s)]
*  Can I... [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2223.56s)]
*  Well, very quickly. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2224.56s)]
*  I want to go to Aaron on something else. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2225.56s)]
*  Very quickly respond. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2227.56s)]
*  Sure, I'll keep this very brief. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2229.56s)]
*  First of all, the rate of the killing [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2231.56s)]
*  of civilians in Gaza is unprecedented. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2233.56s)]
*  Yes, there are other civil wars [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2235.56s)]
*  throughout the Arab world in which more people [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2237.56s)]
*  cumulatively were killed over a period of many years, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2239.56s)]
*  but the rate of killing Palestinian children, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2241.6s)]
*  especially in the opening months [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2243.6s)]
*  after October 7th, they were killing [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2245.6s)]
*  136 children per day. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2247.6s)]
*  That is a number that is unprecedented, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2249.6s)]
*  now leading into the tens of thousands [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2251.6s)]
*  of Palestinian children. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2253.6s)]
*  So we are seeing a rate of killing [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2254.6s)]
*  and destruction that is actually unprecedented, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2256.6s)]
*  and it has demonstrated not just... [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2258.6s)]
*  Wait, and your source for 136 a day, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2260.6s)]
*  your source, please? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2262.6s)]
*  Omar, your source, please? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2263.6s)]
*  What's your source, please? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2265.6s)]
*  Yes, I'm happy to provide them all... [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2267.6s)]
*  I'm not going to use them. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2269.64s)]
*  Don't chat, GBT. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2271.64s)]
*  I don't remember what specific number... [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2273.64s)]
*  Well, I can tell you the source is the Hamas-run health authority. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2275.64s)]
*  Hamas is your source, thank you. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2278.64s)]
*  There were independent human rights organisations... [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2280.64s)]
*  It's an important but. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2282.64s)]
*  Hamas' figures previously, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2284.64s)]
*  before October 7th, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2286.64s)]
*  in terms of casualty numbers, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2288.64s)]
*  have later been pretty accurate, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2290.64s)]
*  it turned out, and accepted by Israel. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2292.64s)]
*  Oh, I said that, for about 47,000 [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2294.64s)]
*  one-to-one combatant to civilian ratio, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2296.64s)]
*  and that's not accurate. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2298.68s)]
*  No, it's not one-to-one. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2300.68s)]
*  That part is a lie as well. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2302.68s)]
*  But also, the key point is, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2304.68s)]
*  50% of the population of Gaza is under 18, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2306.68s)]
*  so the ratio numbers don't count [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2308.68s)]
*  unless you factor in the fact [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2310.68s)]
*  that a disproportionate number of children have been killed. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2312.68s)]
*  That is indisputable. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2315.68s)]
*  Let me bring Aaron in on something else. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2317.68s)]
*  ICE has arrested the Palestinian leader [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2319.68s)]
*  of Columbia University's anti-Israel protests. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2321.68s)]
*  Many people think this is a violation of free speech [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2324.68s)]
*  and the First Amendment. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2327.72s)]
*  Others think that, given Hamas is a terror group [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2329.72s)]
*  prescribed in America, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2332.72s)]
*  they're perfectly entitled, this administration, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2334.72s)]
*  to start deporting those who openly supported Hamas. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2336.72s)]
*  What do you say about this? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2339.72s)]
*  The guy's name was Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2341.72s)]
*  He's a Palestinian refugee raised in Syria. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2343.72s)]
*  He was the lead student negotiator [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2346.72s)]
*  for the pro-Palestinian encampment at Columbia. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2348.72s)]
*  And Columbia, of course, became a kind of epicentre [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2351.72s)]
*  of pro-Palestinian student protests then. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2353.72s)]
*  Many Americans were genuinely, extremely offended [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2355.7599999999998s)]
*  by a lot of the pro-Hamas sentiment and insignia [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2358.7599999999998s)]
*  that was being seen on these protests. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2361.7599999999998s)]
*  And it looks like now the Trump administration [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2364.7599999999998s)]
*  is moving on them. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2366.7599999999998s)]
*  Here's what you call pro-Hamas. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2369.7599999999998s)]
*  I would just simply call it anti-mass murder. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2370.7599999999998s)]
*  That's what these brave Columbia students were protesting. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2373.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think it's an egregious attack on free speech [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2375.7599999999998s)]
*  that a permanent resident with a green card, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2377.7599999999998s)]
*  he's married to a US citizen, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2379.7599999999998s)]
*  she's eight months pregnant, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2381.7599999999998s)]
*  has been snatched from his home. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2382.7599999999998s)]
*  He's not charged with anything. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2384.8s)]
*  No one's indicted him for providing material support [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2386.8s)]
*  to Hamas or any other group [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2389.8s)]
*  because this whole action is simply political. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2391.8s)]
*  It's an attack on free speech. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2394.8s)]
*  These students who put up these encampments [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2396.8s)]
*  on campuses last year, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2401.8s)]
*  I think that was one of the most courageous acts [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2403.8s)]
*  of moral conscience that we've seen in the US [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2406.8s)]
*  in many, many years. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2408.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2409.8s)]
*  And it outraged the establishment. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2410.8s)]
*  A bunch of students just shouting and yelling outside. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2411.8s)]
*  It's not that courageous. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2413.84s)]
*  I think the point that people are making [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2414.84s)]
*  about why it was so offensive and egregious [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2416.84s)]
*  was the open brazen support [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2419.84s)]
*  that so many of them seem to have specifically for Hamas. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2421.84s)]
*  If you were there protesting, supporting Palestinian civilians, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2425.84s)]
*  OK, the Palestinian people, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2429.84s)]
*  but the moment you are directly endorsing [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2431.84s)]
*  and supporting a terror group, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2434.84s)]
*  surely all bets are off them. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2436.84s)]
*  Why should America allow you to remain in the United States [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2437.84s)]
*  if you're endorsing a terror group? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2442.88s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2444.88s)]
*  about the arrest of Mr. Khalil said, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2446.88s)]
*  we'll be revoking the visas and or green cards [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2448.88s)]
*  for Hamas supporters in America [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2451.88s)]
*  so they can be deported. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2453.88s)]
*  Many Americans will agree with that. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2454.88s)]
*  Again, first of all, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2457.88s)]
*  you have the right to free speech to support whoever you want. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2458.88s)]
*  You can support Hamas if you want to. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2461.88s)]
*  Now, I went to these encampments. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2463.88s)]
*  But you can't endorse terrorist activity, can you? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2464.88s)]
*  Because that is inciting... [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2467.88s)]
*  Well, that's inciting terrorism. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2469.92s)]
*  What there was an endorsement of the right [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2471.92s)]
*  to resist military occupation, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2474.92s)]
*  which is internationally recognised right. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2476.92s)]
*  If you endorse Hamas's behaviour, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2478.92s)]
*  you are endorsing terrorism, which is a crime, isn't it? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2480.92s)]
*  If you promote and incite terrorism... [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2484.92s)]
*  No, it's not a crime. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2486.92s)]
*  That's why he hasn't been charged with it. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2487.92s)]
*  If it's a crime, then why hasn't he been charged with it? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2489.92s)]
*  Well, let's wait and see. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2491.92s)]
*  He hasn't been charged with it. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2492.92s)]
*  He's not going to be charged with it [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2493.92s)]
*  because this is an attack on free speech. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2495.92s)]
*  Robert Schmuehle, an attack on free speech. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2497.96s)]
*  Many have said that. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2500.96s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2501.96s)]
*  Deport him now, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2502.96s)]
*  because he's not promoting free speech. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2503.96s)]
*  He's promoting incitement to violence. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2505.96s)]
*  Hate speech is actually outlawed in the United States. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2507.96s)]
*  I love the First Amendment, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2509.96s)]
*  but you cannot incite violence for people to be attacked. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2510.96s)]
*  Now, when they go to these encampments in Barnard or Berkeley, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2513.96s)]
*  they're not just protesting. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2519.96s)]
*  They're calling for intifada now. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2521.96s)]
*  They're calling for an absolute... for violence. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2523.96s)]
*  They're calling for the murder of Jews, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2526.0s)]
*  and they are endorsing Hamas. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2528.0s)]
*  Aaron is being disingenuous. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2530.0s)]
*  So many of them openly tell... [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2532.0s)]
*  They have no shame telling the AP, telling CNN, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2534.0s)]
*  Fox, MSNBC, that they are absolutely pro-Hamas. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2536.0s)]
*  And intifada now is a call for violence. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2540.0s)]
*  Incitement to violence in the age [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2543.0s)]
*  of the greatest tsunami of antisemitism [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2545.0s)]
*  since the Second World War, since the Holocaust, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2547.0s)]
*  where Jewish students are harassed, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2549.0s)]
*  intimidated, punched, beat up, kicked, spat on. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2551.0s)]
*  We've seen it all. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2554.0s)]
*  They're not even... [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2555.04s)]
*  You see, what October 7th did [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2556.04s)]
*  with Hamas filming their atrocities [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2558.04s)]
*  is inspire everyone else to do the same, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2560.04s)]
*  which is why we're seeing Al Joulani kill the Alawites, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2562.04s)]
*  and they're all filming it. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2565.04s)]
*  They're not even worried about the ICC prosecuting them, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2566.04s)]
*  and that's what these students at Barnard are doing. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2568.04s)]
*  He should be deported. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2571.04s)]
*  I understand he's married to an American wife. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2572.04s)]
*  That breaks my heart. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2574.04s)]
*  But he's the one who did this to himself. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2576.04s)]
*  But Jewish students can go to university [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2578.04s)]
*  without fear of being murdered. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2581.04s)]
*  And I would say one thing to you, Aaron, if I may. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2583.08s)]
*  Just one second, please. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2585.08s)]
*  You say... [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2586.08s)]
*  Aaron, you started... [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2587.08s)]
*  By the way, I didn't know you were Jewish. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2588.08s)]
*  You were my Jewish brother. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2589.08s)]
*  Nothing will change that. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2590.08s)]
*  May I just say, you know, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2591.08s)]
*  I've been disappointed by many Jews since October 7th. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2592.08s)]
*  When I... One of the last times I did Pierce's show, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2595.08s)]
*  I debated Mahmadi's job. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2598.08s)]
*  One of his supporters attacked me in the Fountain Blue Hotel, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2599.08s)]
*  one of the most famous hotels in Miami Beach, Florida, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2602.08s)]
*  one-third Jewish. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2605.08s)]
*  And he came and said, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2606.08s)]
*  Mahmadi's job, and he threatened to murder me. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2607.08s)]
*  It was filmed four and a half minutes. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2609.08s)]
*  And the Jewish owner, Jeffrey Sofer, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2610.08s)]
*  billionaire, sued me, not him, to silence me [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2612.12s)]
*  because anti-Semitism is bad for business at the hotel. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2615.12s)]
*  I've been disappointed by many Jews since October 7th. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2618.12s)]
*  But no Jew, plenty of anti-Semites, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2620.12s)]
*  no Jew has ever called me a Nazi before. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2623.12s)]
*  And I would really ask you in the remaining time of the show, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2625.12s)]
*  just for your own credibility, I don't care. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2628.12s)]
*  You're off the reservation, my brother. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2630.12s)]
*  Your credibility... [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2632.12s)]
*  This is gonna stay on your Wikipedia page forever, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2633.12s)]
*  and you're never gonna live it down. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2635.12s)]
*  So you got a couple minutes left, say, you know what? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2637.12s)]
*  In the heat of the moment, I overstated it. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2639.12s)]
*  I said that a Jew... [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2641.16s)]
*  Because the Nazis killed 10,000 Jews every day. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2642.16s)]
*  They'd gas 1.5 million Jews. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2645.16s)]
*  I've gassed no Arab. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2648.16s)]
*  I've hurt no Arab. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2649.16s)]
*  I've never... [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2650.16s)]
*  I've defended Arab, my brother. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2651.16s)]
*  Can I interject here on the substantive point? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2652.16s)]
*  Just so you'll be invited back on shows, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2654.16s)]
*  because otherwise you're gonna be labeled [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2656.16s)]
*  an off-the-reservation extremist. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2658.16s)]
*  And I'd rather hear your voice. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2659.16s)]
*  Rabbi Shmueli... [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2660.16s)]
*  You have just a few minutes to take it back. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2661.16s)]
*  Just say, I lost it. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2664.16s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2665.16s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2666.16s)]
*  I was responding to you invoking the Nazi Holocaust. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2667.16s)]
*  No, you said I am a successor to the Nazis. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2669.2s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2671.2s)]
*  You know, the problem with TV is that it's forever. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2672.2s)]
*  It's in response to the... [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2674.2s)]
*  Just say you're sorry. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2675.2s)]
*  Well, look, I have to say, I was pretty stunned you said that, Aron. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2676.2s)]
*  I mean, to actually directly say he's a successor to the Nazis, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2681.2s)]
*  given you know his history as a high-profile Jewish man [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2685.2s)]
*  and his family's history, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2689.2s)]
*  I mean, that's about as an appalling an allegation [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2691.2s)]
*  you could make against anyone like Rabbi Shmueli, isn't it? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2694.2s)]
*  Not merely as appalling as supporting a genocide, frankly. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2697.24s)]
*  And if I can answer... [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2700.24s)]
*  Two things can be true at once. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2701.24s)]
*  If I can answer... [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2703.24s)]
*  Aron, yeah. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2704.24s)]
*  He invoked the Nazi Holocaust to actually say [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2705.24s)]
*  we should not be negotiating with Hamas, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2709.24s)]
*  who we compared to the Nazis. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2711.24s)]
*  And my point was, if we're going to be making analogies [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2712.24s)]
*  to the Nazi Holocaust, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2714.24s)]
*  and the fact is you have a Jewish supremacist state [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2716.24s)]
*  that believes it's superior, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2719.24s)]
*  has more rights than the Palestinians of that land, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2720.24s)]
*  has put the people of Gaza under a medieval siege [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2723.24s)]
*  subjected them to mass murder, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2726.2799999999997s)]
*  put them in a concentration camp. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2728.2799999999997s)]
*  And in that respect, that's where the analogy to... [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2730.2799999999997s)]
*  Of course, no analogy is perfect. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2732.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm not saying that Israeli crimes are on par [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2734.2799999999997s)]
*  with that of the Nazis. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2736.2799999999997s)]
*  Nothing compares to what the Nazis did to the Jews [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2737.2799999999997s)]
*  and other groups. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2741.2799999999997s)]
*  So was it fair to say he's a successor to a Nazi? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2742.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, seriously. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2745.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm saying, my point was, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2746.2799999999997s)]
*  if you're going to be invoking the Nazi Holocaust, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2748.2799999999997s)]
*  the current successor to the Nazi legacy of supremacy... [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2750.2799999999997s)]
*  Of supremacy and mass murder... [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2755.32s)]
*  Are the Israelis? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2756.32s)]
*  ...are Israel and its apologists. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2757.32s)]
*  Okay, fine. Okay, I got it. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2758.32s)]
*  So I'm a Nazi, Israel's a Nazi. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2759.32s)]
*  Here's... [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2760.32s)]
*  Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2761.32s)]
*  Can I... [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2762.32s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, one second, one second. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2763.32s)]
*  A point of historical fact. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2764.32s)]
*  Just on the smearing of the student, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2765.32s)]
*  I've not had a chance to respond to that. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2766.32s)]
*  I will come to you. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2767.32s)]
*  Just one second. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2768.32s)]
*  A point of historical fact. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2769.32s)]
*  You keep on saying that Israel denies [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2770.32s)]
*  Gaza's, Palestinians' rights. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2773.32s)]
*  I mean, I'm just shocked by this. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2774.32s)]
*  Again, I just want to speak fact right now. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2775.32s)]
*  Israel has 1.9 million Arab Muslim citizens [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2778.32s)]
*  who not only enjoy every right that an Israeli has, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2783.36s)]
*  they enjoy more rights. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2787.36s)]
*  If Israel's an apartheid state, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2788.36s)]
*  it's that they're actually oppressing Jews. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2790.36s)]
*  I'll prove it easily. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2792.36s)]
*  My sons had to go to war, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2793.36s)]
*  even though they're Americans, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2794.36s)]
*  because there's a draft only against Jews. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2795.36s)]
*  Now, if you think a draft to go to war [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2798.36s)]
*  and for me and my wife to not sleep for the past 10 months [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2800.36s)]
*  as our sons were forced to fight the Hamas terrorists in Gaza, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2802.36s)]
*  the Hamas terrorists of Hezbollah in Lebanon, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2806.36s)]
*  that's not easy. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2808.36s)]
*  Every time we saw 972 code number, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2809.36s)]
*  we couldn't sleep at night. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2811.36s)]
*  What tore America apart in the 1960s [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2812.4s)]
*  where it was even more divided than right now under Trump? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2814.4s)]
*  It was the draft. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2817.4s)]
*  It was the draft. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2818.4s)]
*  It was the draft. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2819.4s)]
*  It was the draft. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2820.4s)]
*  So, Arabs have complete rights. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2821.4s)]
*  Israel is not... [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2823.4s)]
*  Gaza's not an Israeli state. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2824.4s)]
*  What do you mean Israel denies them rights? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2826.4s)]
*  Israel was Jewish. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2828.4s)]
*  And wait, one second, please. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2829.4s)]
*  Please. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2830.4s)]
*  One second, please. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2831.4s)]
*  I'm a historian of the Holocaust. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2832.4s)]
*  I wrote a book called The Holocaust Holiday. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2834.4s)]
*  When you say that Gaza is a concentration camp, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2836.4s)]
*  let me get this straight. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2839.4s)]
*  Have you ever visited Gross Rosen, Mauthausen, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2840.44s)]
*  Birkenau, Auschwitz I, Auschwitz III? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2843.44s)]
*  Have you ever visited Buchenwald? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2846.44s)]
*  Have you ever... Bergen-Belsen? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2848.44s)]
*  Are you telling me there are concentration camps [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2849.44s)]
*  that don't have soldiers in them? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2851.44s)]
*  Are you telling me the SS... [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2853.44s)]
*  There isn't one Israeli soldier in Gaza ever. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2855.44s)]
*  They only went in after October 7th [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2858.44s)]
*  because in 2006, Hamas, which you said was elected, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2860.44s)]
*  even though we can question the election, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2863.44s)]
*  but let's say it was legitimate. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2865.44s)]
*  They decided to steal every dollar that came in [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2866.48s)]
*  that could have built power plants, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2870.48s)]
*  that could have built schools and hospitals, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2872.48s)]
*  and they built terror tunnels [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2874.48s)]
*  and they built Qasam rockets. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2876.48s)]
*  So Israel is not denying them a single right. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2878.48s)]
*  And to call it a concentration camp, with all due respect, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2880.48s)]
*  is a fundamental desecration of the Holocaust [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2883.48s)]
*  and a desecration of the memory of the 6th Amendment. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2886.48s)]
*  I'm not alone in that. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2888.48s)]
*  Giora Eiland also called them at Bruch Kimerling. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2889.48s)]
*  Plenty of Israelis have called it that as well [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2891.48s)]
*  because that's exactly what they were doing. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2893.48s)]
*  Name one. Name one Israeli. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2894.48s)]
*  Hang on. Hang on. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2895.52s)]
*  Baruch Kimerling. Have you heard of him? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2896.52s)]
*  He's a nobody. Who's heard of him? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2898.52s)]
*  Has anyone watching this heard of Baruch Kimerling? [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2900.52s)]
*  Tell me one prominent Israeli who called, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2902.52s)]
*  who said that Israel are Nazis. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2904.52s)]
*  Tell me one. One. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2906.52s)]
*  Who? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2907.52s)]
*  Giora Eiland. You know who he is, right? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2908.52s)]
*  I have no idea who these people are. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2910.52s)]
*  Tell me someone who actually has stature. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2912.52s)]
*  Tell me... I mean, I'll tell you that. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2914.52s)]
*  Baruchovich, Baruchovich said it. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2916.52s)]
*  All right. I will say I think it was wrong. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2918.52s)]
*  I think it was wrong to say that, and I do. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2921.52s)]
*  I think I was incredibly surprised you said it. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2923.56s)]
*  I just think you cannot possibly equate [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2925.56s)]
*  a bunch of Jews to the Nazis. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2928.56s)]
*  It's just... It's incomprehensible to me. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2933.56s)]
*  Let me come to Omar for this last point. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2935.56s)]
*  This is Trump's world vision for Gaza, the Riviera. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2938.56s)]
*  Let's take a look at a look to remind ourselves how Trump saw this. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2942.56s)]
*  He reposted an AI video on Truth Social. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2946.56s)]
*  MUSIC PLAYS [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2949.6s)]
*  Now, it's been roundly ridiculed, obviously, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2973.6s)]
*  but the effect of it is exactly what I thought might happen, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2976.64s)]
*  which is it was such an outlandish idea that Trump had [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2979.64s)]
*  that all the Palestinians would simply leave [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2983.64s)]
*  and you'd build a new Riviera there and so on, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2985.64s)]
*  that it's forced the Arab world to come together [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2988.64s)]
*  and to come up with an alternative plan, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2991.64s)]
*  which they now have, a $53 billion plan [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2993.64s)]
*  for the post-war reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2996.64s)]
*  You know, sometimes you have to look, as I say, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=2999.64s)]
*  you take... [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3002.68s)]
*  Trump will take things to the nth degree [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3003.68s)]
*  to force people to a negotiating table [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3006.68s)]
*  to actually get stuff done. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3008.68s)]
*  I mean, do you see a bit of method to the madness there? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3010.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not entirely convinced, to be honest, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3014.68s)]
*  that this kind of vision is part of the reason why other countries [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3017.68s)]
*  were pushed to come up with a plan as quickly... [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3020.68s)]
*  Maybe sped it up, came up with it a little faster, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3022.68s)]
*  but the only plan that you need for Gaza [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3024.68s)]
*  is for Israel to get the hell out of Gaza [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3026.68s)]
*  and just whatever happens from there happens, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3028.68s)]
*  it's just not Israel's business. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3030.72s)]
*  But, Piers, I don't want this segment to end [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3032.72s)]
*  without me addressing the student issue [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3034.72s)]
*  that you mentioned a little bit earlier [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3036.72s)]
*  because this kid, Mahmoud Khalil, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3038.72s)]
*  has basically been smeared by the Trump administration, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3040.72s)]
*  by Marco Rubio on Twitter, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3043.72s)]
*  by accusing him of being a Hamas supporter [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3045.72s)]
*  and a terror supporter. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3047.72s)]
*  What is he? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3048.72s)]
*  This student has said nothing of the kind. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3049.72s)]
*  He's guilty of being a part of a protest [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3051.72s)]
*  in which people are protesting genocide [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3054.72s)]
*  and then maybe every once in a while [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3057.72s)]
*  somebody might say something that is off-putting or awful. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3059.7599999999998s)]
*  But how do you know he's not a Hamas supporter out of interest? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3061.7599999999998s)]
*  He has... Nobody has made any allegations [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3064.7599999999998s)]
*  or presented any evidence that he has said or done anything. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3067.7599999999998s)]
*  You just said Marco Rubio. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3069.7599999999998s)]
*  You just said the Secretary of State of the United States did. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3071.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes, without any evidence. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3073.7599999999998s)]
*  Without any evidence is what I'm saying. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3075.7599999999998s)]
*  There's no evidence against him. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3077.7599999999998s)]
*  But they are building... [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3079.7599999999998s)]
*  But actually, that is... [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3081.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, that is an important point of distinction. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3083.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, if he's going to be deported [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3085.7599999999998s)]
*  for supporting Hamas, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3088.8s)]
*  you do surely have to present evidence [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3090.8s)]
*  that he has supported Hamas. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3092.8s)]
*  I don't think leading a protest group [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3094.8s)]
*  where most of them behaved peacefully [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3097.8s)]
*  and were not brazenly supporting Hamas [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3099.8s)]
*  would be enough, in my eyes, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3101.8s)]
*  to justify what would then be surely an infringement [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3104.8s)]
*  of his First Amendment rights. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3107.8s)]
*  I want America to be... [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3109.8s)]
*  One more point on this. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3111.8s)]
*  I want America to be a nation of laws. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3112.8s)]
*  I want Muslim Americans there, of course, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3114.8s)]
*  as well as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3116.84s)]
*  The word American is infinitely applicable. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3118.84s)]
*  But you accept he'd have to have shown support for Hamas? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3120.84s)]
*  But he's not an American. That's the point. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3122.84s)]
*  So he can be deported. His wife's American. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3124.84s)]
*  I'd hate to see him point apart, but he made his choices. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3126.84s)]
*  But if the reason given by the Secretary of State, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3128.84s)]
*  Marco Rubio, is that he supported Hamas, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3130.84s)]
*  it is surely in the interest of justice and fairness [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3132.84s)]
*  that there is some evidence shown to the American people [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3135.84s)]
*  that he actually did support Hamas. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3138.84s)]
*  There will be due process, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3140.84s)]
*  and, of course, the administration and ICE [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3142.84s)]
*  will have to find evidence. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3144.88s)]
*  That's the United States of America. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3146.88s)]
*  But I will say that to say that these were peaceful protests... [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3148.88s)]
*  So far, it's been snapped and disappeared. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3150.88s)]
*  I think one of the reasons that Trump won the election, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3152.88s)]
*  including shocking the world by winning the popular vote, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3154.88s)]
*  was because of these demonstrations. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3156.88s)]
*  They were anything but peaceful. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3158.88s)]
*  People saw total anarchy. They saw our best universities, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3160.88s)]
*  all the Ivy League universities, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3162.88s)]
*  Brown and Harvard and Berkeley and Columbia [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3164.88s)]
*  being burned to the ground. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3166.88s)]
*  They saw Jewish students being spat on. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3168.88s)]
*  We saw Jewish students... Excuse me, Aaron. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3170.88s)]
*  ...at Harvard being beaten to a pulp [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3172.92s)]
*  with nothing being done. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3174.92s)]
*  And we Jews are kind of sick of it. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3176.92s)]
*  Most of the violence came from pro-Israel students. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3178.92s)]
*  Wait, since you spoke, Aaron, so much [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3180.92s)]
*  about us being a white supremacist, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3182.92s)]
*  you know, Israel... I'm actually American. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3184.92s)]
*  I'm not Israeli, but I love Israel. I'm Jewish. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3186.92s)]
*  What about... American can't be a supremacist state, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3188.92s)]
*  either. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3190.92s)]
*  We're Jews or second-class citizens. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3192.92s)]
*  Students who work hard to get into Harvard [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3194.92s)]
*  do not deserve to be beaten up because they wear a kippah. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3196.92s)]
*  And I've been to these protests, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3198.92s)]
*  and they were disgusting. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3200.96s)]
*  And I want to tell you how many times [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3202.96s)]
*  that my life has been threatened. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3204.96s)]
*  I told you my life was threatened at the Fountain Blue Miami Beach. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3206.96s)]
*  My life was threatened in Times Square. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3209.96s)]
*  My wife was almost punched out by a Mohammadi jobs supporter [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3211.96s)]
*  outside Carnegie Hall. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3214.96s)]
*  Here's the thing. We can all agree [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3216.96s)]
*  that violence is unacceptable [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3218.96s)]
*  at any protest. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3220.96s)]
*  But we should also all agree that the fundamental bedrock [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3222.96s)]
*  of a society, a democracy like America, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3224.96s)]
*  is the right, the free right to protest. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3227.96s)]
*  Peacefully. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3230.0s)]
*  So the question then becomes, as Omar has said, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3232.0s)]
*  whether this character, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3234.0s)]
*  who was clearly leading the student protest, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3236.0s)]
*  but was he directly endorsing [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3238.0s)]
*  or supporting Hamas? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3241.0s)]
*  And I do think it's reasonable to ask that question. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3243.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3245.0s)]
*  Does the government have evidence [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3247.0s)]
*  that he was actually supporting Hamas? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3249.0s)]
*  Fair question. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3251.0s)]
*  To me, if it does, it should present it, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3253.0s)]
*  and then that, to me, would be absolutely fair ground [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3255.0s)]
*  for deportation. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3258.04s)]
*  I have evidence that Rabbi Shmueli [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3260.04s)]
*  is a smear wheel on top of another smear. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3262.04s)]
*  If no evidence is produced, it does look like [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3264.04s)]
*  people will then say, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3266.04s)]
*  where's the evidence? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3268.04s)]
*  And that doesn't work. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3270.04s)]
*  Aaron, let Aaron... [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3272.04s)]
*  Aaron, sorry? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3274.04s)]
*  I have evidence that Rabbi Shmueli is supporting [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3276.04s)]
*  the terror state of Israel. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3278.04s)]
*  Does that mean he should lose his rights? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3280.04s)]
*  No, he has rights. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3282.04s)]
*  You have evidence? I want you to provide it. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3284.04s)]
*  Well, Israel is not... [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3286.08s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3288.08s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, Aaron, Aaron, I'm giving you a chance... [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3290.08s)]
*  Well, no, I can answer that question, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3292.08s)]
*  because Israel is not a prescribed terror group [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3294.08s)]
*  in the United States, so the analogy doesn't apply. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3296.08s)]
*  You might want it to, Aaron. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3298.08s)]
*  Well, Aaron might want it to, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3300.08s)]
*  but the reality is that one is a terror group [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3302.08s)]
*  prescribed in America and one isn't, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3304.08s)]
*  so until that changes the law, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3306.08s)]
*  if you were to endorse Hamas violence, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3308.08s)]
*  that would be a crime. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3310.08s)]
*  Yes, finally Omar. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3312.08s)]
*  Just last word. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3314.12s)]
*  The smear against this one student [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3316.12s)]
*  is built on the other smear, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3318.12s)]
*  which is that these protests are somehow antisemitic [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3320.12s)]
*  when many of these protests are led [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3322.12s)]
*  by progressive Jewish voices... [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3324.12s)]
*  Yeah, but there was antisemitism amongst the protestors, too. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3326.12s)]
*  I saw it. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3328.12s)]
*  You have to be kidding. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3330.12s)]
*  Jewish students were beaten up, sat on... [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3332.12s)]
*  Some of those protests were... [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3334.12s)]
*  Some of them were definitely antisemitic. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3336.12s)]
*  I saw it, so there's no question that... [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3338.12s)]
*  Yes, but there's a double standard [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3340.12s)]
*  where they attack... [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3342.16s)]
*  We've seen them on video at USCLA [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3344.16s)]
*  in which pro-Israel... [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3346.16s)]
*  UCLA is the only example you can give [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3348.16s)]
*  because it's the only place where it happened. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3350.16s)]
*  Okay, listen. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3352.16s)]
*  We should all support the right to free protest [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3354.16s)]
*  and in America, there should be a bedrock. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3356.16s)]
*  But if people openly support [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3358.16s)]
*  an illegal prescribed terror organisation... [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3360.16s)]
*  Or engage in violence, like burn down the universities. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3362.16s)]
*  Or engage in violence, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3364.16s)]
*  then either of those things, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3366.16s)]
*  if you're not an actual American citizen, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3368.16s)]
*  there should be grounds for deportation. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3370.2s)]
*  But I do think Omar's raised a good point. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3372.2s)]
*  Let's see some evidence. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3374.2s)]
*  Let's show the American people [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3376.2s)]
*  how this guy actually supported Hamas. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3378.2s)]
*  Then it's a different argument. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3380.2s)]
*  Without that, people will ask that very question [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3382.2s)]
*  with good reason. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3384.2s)]
*  I've got to leave it there. It's been a very interesting debate. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdg02g3394&t=3386.2s)]
