Video Description: During his 100 days as President, Donald Trump scored a volley of popular early wins on issues like trans in sport, sealing the US border and rolling back DEI. But it’s the tough stuff - namely tariffs and war - that will really define his presidency. And it’s going to take a lot longer than 100 days to figure them out. 

Piers Morgan brings another lively debate on the latest in US politics, including Trump and Zelensky’s reunion at the funeral of Pope Francis, with Vincent Oshana from the PBD podcast, Democratic congressional candidate, Kat Abughazaleh, ‘The Bulwark Podcast’ host Tim Miller and Conservative commentator and former RNC spokesperson, Elizabeth Pipko.

Then - former NFL star Shannon Sharpe is stepping back from his role at ESPN after a civil lawsuit accused him of sexual assault and Diddy’s trial is to begin in Manhattan next week. Plus, 73-year-old American football legend Bill Belichick is in the spotlight after his 24-year-old girlfriend crashed a major TV interview. Joining Piers to discuss all this is rapper and commentator Lord Jamar, host of ‘Determined Society’ Shawn French, producer Choke No Joke and criminal defense attorney Stacy Schneider.

# “This Is Why You’ll Keep LOSING!” 100 Days of Trump + Bill Belichick & Shannon Sharpe Scandals
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc)
*  That two-year-old was here with an illegal alien mother, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=0.0s)]
*  and if the mother gets deported, Piers, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3.5s)]
*  the kids go with the mother. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  So stop that rhetoric. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  She is a two-year-old being treated for cancer. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=8.34s)]
*  Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=9.94s)]
*  You're sticking up for MS-13 members. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=11.94s)]
*  Have you ever encountered an MS-13 member? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=13.88s)]
*  We are conflating several different issues here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=16.34s)]
*  So, Tim, can you find it in yourself to say [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  that what's happened on the southern border is a good thing? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=21.48s)]
*  I can't, and here's why, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=24.42s)]
*  and I was happy to let my cousin Vinnie over there go. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=25.72s)]
*  I thought he was gonna explode. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  He might have had a heart attack over there [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=28.68s)]
*  if we didn't give him a chance to talk, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=29.92s)]
*  but here's the thing, Piers. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=31.22s)]
*  How did you guys meet? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=33.46s)]
*  I'm not talking about this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=35.2s)]
*  No? No. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=36.9s)]
*  Watch this guy whose reputation is one of the hardest, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=38.66s)]
*  toughest, meanest, most successful coaches [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=42.04s)]
*  in the history of American football [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=45.18s)]
*  getting bossed around by this girl [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  about what he can and can't say. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  When I'm talking about that, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=51.54s)]
*  well, they would just ask, when did you meet? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=53.14s)]
*  The problem with obsessing over a president's first 100 days [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=56.18s)]
*  is the general sense that everything is now or never, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=59.74s)]
*  boom or bust. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=62.74s)]
*  Three months to deliver a program [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=64.02s)]
*  that was four years in the making [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=65.62s)]
*  before a long slide down to the midterms, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=67.12s)]
*  and then beginning the whole process again. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=69.32s)]
*  Well, President Trump's school of volley [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  are popular early wins on things like trans, women, and sport, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=72.86s)]
*  sealing the US border and rolling back DEI. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=76.5s)]
*  But it's the tough stuff, namely tariffs and wars, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=79.66s)]
*  that we'll really define his presidency. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=83.82s)]
*  It's going to take a lot longer than 100 days, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=85.42s)]
*  methinks, to figure them out. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=88.12s)]
*  Well, the funeral of Pope Francis [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=90.46s)]
*  brought Trump and Zelensky together [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=91.76s)]
*  with an extraordinary head-to-head this weekend, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=93.62s)]
*  the first time they've met [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=95.56s)]
*  since the infamous Oval Office bust-up. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=96.8s)]
*  Democrats are upset that Trump wore a blue suit to the funeral, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=98.64s)]
*  as did Biden and the Prince of Wales. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=101.7s)]
*  Magga is upset that Zelensky didn't wear a suit at all, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=104.34s)]
*  which, of course, the Pope never did either. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=107.08s)]
*  A bit like 100 days itself, it's a silly sideshow [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=109.68s)]
*  compared to a conversation that could have life or death [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=112.34s)]
*  consequences to thousands of people. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=115.3s)]
*  And speaking of sideshows, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=117.34s)]
*  the Democrats have now spent 100 days squabbling. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=118.44s)]
*  DNC Vice Chair David Hogg is the legislature's stir the pot. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=121.54s)]
*  He says he wants to spend $20 million [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=125.44s)]
*  ousting Democrats deemed ineffective and out of touch. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=127.72s)]
*  The President may be taking a whack in the polls, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=130.78s)]
*  but so far the only alternative is none of the above. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=133.12s)]
*  Well, to debate all of this and more, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=136.82s)]
*  I'm joined by the PBD podcast, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=138.4s)]
*  angry patriot Vinny Ashana, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  TikToker and Democratic congressional candidate Kat Abu, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  host of the Ball Walk podcast, Tim Miller, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=146.0s)]
*  and the conservative commentator [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=148.4s)]
*  and former RNC spokesperson Elizabeth Pipko. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=149.5s)]
*  Well, welcome to all of you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=152.3s)]
*  Elizabeth, let me start with you, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=154.24s)]
*  because you were one of the very, very rare Trumpers [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=155.3s)]
*  at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  which had no president and no comedian [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=161.4s)]
*  and looked to be an absolute crashing ball. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=164.28s)]
*  The only highlight, it seemed to me, though, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=167.74s)]
*  was an interesting admission by Alex Thompson, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=169.56s)]
*  one of the journalists who won an award there. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  One serious note. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  To my bones, I believe that reporting [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=178.12s)]
*  and the White House Correspondents Association [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  is as necessary as ever. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=184.44s)]
*  President Biden's decline and its cover-up [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=187.28s)]
*  by the people around him is a reminder [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=191.29999999999998s)]
*  that every White House, regardless of party, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=194.29999999999998s)]
*  is capable of deception. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=197.84s)]
*  What was it like to be there as a pro-Trump-er? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=199.88s)]
*  And has that event got any relevance anymore? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=203.88s)]
*  You know, I actually don't think that it does. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=209.24s)]
*  I'm sad that I finally got to go [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=211.2s)]
*  when it was no longer relevant. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=212.54s)]
*  You mentioned there was no comedian. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=214.96s)]
*  I want to point out the event was still very much a joke. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=216.32s)]
*  It was very strange for me to be there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=219.2s)]
*  I have to admit, the program started a few minutes in. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=221.28s)]
*  My jaw dropped because I see a room full of journalists. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=224.24s)]
*  Basically applauding themselves, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=228.0s)]
*  patting themselves on the back for admitting [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=229.26s)]
*  that they missed the story of Biden's cognitive decline [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=231.28s)]
*  and will never make that same mistake again. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=234.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, I'm remembering how many times [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=236.96s)]
*  I was attacked for bringing it up, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  how many times countless people on the right, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=240.2s)]
*  or even those completely unaffiliated with politics, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=242.12s)]
*  were attacked for bringing it up. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  And I'm watching journalists, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=245.8s)]
*  which are supposed to be responsible [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=246.88s)]
*  for bringing that information to the people [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=248.16s)]
*  and actually holding the White House accountable, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=250.16s)]
*  even when they don't agree with those in there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=252.28s)]
*  And the fact is, these journalists were very much [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=255.04s)]
*  upfront with the fact that they did [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=257.72s)]
*  what they were supposed to do. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=259.04s)]
*  They made a really tiny mistake. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=259.88000000000005s)]
*  They promised to never make it again, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=261.36s)]
*  and they should still have all the trust [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=262.88000000000005s)]
*  and all the faith of the American people. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=264.32000000000005s)]
*  I thought it was very strange. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  I didn't expect any of it, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  but I can only imagine if Donald Trump was in the room, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  it would have looked very different. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=270.36s)]
*  But for me, I don't think Thompson's admission [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=272.36s)]
*  meant very much, and I actually thought [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=274.56s)]
*  it was pretty hypocritical to sit in there [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=276.0s)]
*  and watch all these people support their own work, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=278.32000000000005s)]
*  their own mistakes, and the fact that they themselves [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=280.66s)]
*  are responsible for the fact that trust and faith [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  in the media is at an all-time low. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=285.48s)]
*  Really interesting perspective. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=288.16s)]
*  Tim Miller, I saw you raising your eyebrow there, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=289.8s)]
*  but there is a truth there, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=291.8s)]
*  because it was a bizarre spectacle [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=293.72s)]
*  of a liberal-skewed mainstream media [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=296.88s)]
*  basically openly admitting, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  we dropped the ball massively on Biden's ability [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  to be president of the United States. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=306.8s)]
*  But many would argue, particularly on the left, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  I would think, well, it was entirely self-defeating [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=311.36s)]
*  this ball dropping, probably deliberate. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  You didn't give it the same attention [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=317.68s)]
*  you would have given if it had been, say, Trump. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=319.2s)]
*  And the consequence of not holding Biden to proper account [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=321.32s)]
*  was that actually Donald Trump got re-elected, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=325.76s)]
*  which nobody would have expected. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  So there was a real-time consequence to this ball dropping. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=330.48s)]
*  Do you think, though, that the mainstream media [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=334.52s)]
*  have learned any lessons from this or not? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=336.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think this is the one area, maybe, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=342.56s)]
*  where I can agree with you and the co-panelists, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=344.56s)]
*  is I think that this dinner is pretty stupid. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=346.44s)]
*  I think the last thing that we need [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=348.24s)]
*  is a self-congratulatory ball for political journalists. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=349.76s)]
*  You couldn't have paid me to go this weekend. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=355.44s)]
*  I was at Jazz Fest instead. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=357.24s)]
*  And so I agree that it's kind of silly. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=359.24s)]
*  I do, though, bristle a little bit. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=362.08s)]
*  I'm not speaking about you, Piers, per se, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=365.0s)]
*  but at right-wing commentators talking about [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=366.52s)]
*  how they think that the mainstream media [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  is biased and unfair. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=372.28s)]
*  And if you go to Fox or Steve Bannon's podcast [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  or the Daily Wire, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=380.4s)]
*  I mean, you see North Korea-esque coverage [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=381.55999999999995s)]
*  of what's happening with the president of the United States [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  as he's single-handedly tanking our economy [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  for no good reason, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=390.55999999999995s)]
*  just because he likes the word tariffs, I guess. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=391.52s)]
*  He inherited an economy that was getting better, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=393.67999999999995s)]
*  that was improving, that wasn't perfect, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=395.67999999999995s)]
*  but that was on the right path. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=397.55999999999995s)]
*  And in three months, he has put us on the brink of recession. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=399.92s)]
*  And so I think that the coverage on Fox [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  and on other right-wing media outlets [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=408.52000000000004s)]
*  is, if anything, worse than the mainstream media's [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=411.92s)]
*  coverage of Democrats, which is not perfect by any means. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  And so I just don't know if the right-wing media folks [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=418.16s)]
*  have a lot of great credibility [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=421.48s)]
*  when it comes to demanding unbiased coverage. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=423.0s)]
*  All right, Vinnie, two things there. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=426.48s)]
*  First of all, let's talk about the admission [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=428.8s)]
*  at the White House Correspondence Dinner. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  By the way, I agree, if the president's not there [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=433.92s)]
*  and there's no comedian, there is no point to that event. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=436.36s)]
*  It's pure navel-gazing by the journalists. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=439.16s)]
*  I went, it used to be the convention, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=441.56s)]
*  that if you were a news anchor, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=444.08000000000004s)]
*  and I was at CNN for four years, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=445.48s)]
*  you got to go with a celebrity. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=447.12s)]
*  I got taken by Goldie Horne [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=448.56s)]
*  to the White House Correspondence Dinner. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=450.8s)]
*  We ended up partying at the Vanity Fair party. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=452.2s)]
*  That is glamour, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=454.52s)]
*  I had a great time. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=456.76s)]
*  Then I went with Gerard Butler on a mandate a year after. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=457.84s)]
*  So those days are clearly long gone. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=460.4s)]
*  So I think the event has probably had its time. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=463.08s)]
*  But the admission, Vinnie, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=465.79999999999995s)]
*  and welcome back to Uncensored, always great to have you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=467.56s)]
*  The admission that the media dropped the ball on Joe Biden [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  from one of the award winners on the night saying, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=475.67999999999995s)]
*  "'Me included.'" [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=477.55999999999995s)]
*  Many will say, well, why did you drop the ball? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=479.55999999999995s)]
*  Was it an accidental dropping of the ball? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=482.35999999999996s)]
*  Or was it a quite deliberate ignoring of the obvious fact [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=484.92s)]
*  that he was incompetent [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=489.6s)]
*  because they didn't want to help Trump in any way? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=490.88s)]
*  And ironically, by not doing their job with Biden, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=494.0s)]
*  many might argue that's how Trump got elected. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=497.44s)]
*  If you're always on the move, as I am, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=501.6s)]
*  you probably find it difficult to get all of the fruits [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=503.32s)]
*  and vegetables you need to keep your body [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=505.8s)]
*  and your doctor happy. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=507.96s)]

*  thank you again for having me all the time. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=557.1600000000001s)]
*  It's a joke to me that we're trying to pretend [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=559.2s)]
*  all these people from the, just the left-wing media period, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=562.1600000000001s)]
*  pretending as if, oh, we had no idea every single, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=566.08s)]
*  how many days did it took Piers for him [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=570.44s)]
*  to actually address the nation [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=571.9200000000001s)]
*  or even have a press conference? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=573.4000000000001s)]
*  They hid him during COVID, they put him in a basement [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=574.8800000000001s)]

*  They kept him in the basement. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=583.08s)]
*  Every time he spoke in front of a camera, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=584.48s)]
*  it was a meme, it was a joke. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=586.84s)]
*  Everybody knew Piers, but they were told to shut up [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=589.6s)]
*  and they were told to play ball, okay? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=593.24s)]
*  Because they had to do it, because he was put in there [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=595.0s)]

*  from Chris Cuomo to Stephen A. Smith, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=634.4s)]
*  everybody now is like, oh, we messed up, guys, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=636.56s)]
*  we're not like the left. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=639.3199999999999s)]
*  They're exactly like the left, Piers. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=640.64s)]
*  I'm not gonna give them any leeway. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=642.4s)]
*  They all knew, but they kept their mouths shut [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=643.92s)]
*  because it's not Trump. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=645.8s)]
*  And Piers, no matter what Trump does, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=647.2399999999999s)]
*  they're going to complain. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  If Trump were to help, Elon Musk. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=650.56s)]
*  Let me jump in. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=652.9599999999999s)]
*  So I don't disagree with some of what you said there. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=653.9599999999999s)]
*  Just playing devil's advocate, though. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=657.7199999999999s)]
*  What would you be saying if Joe Biden [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=659.8s)]
*  had suddenly unleashed a tariff war on the world [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=662.0s)]
*  that nobody had ever seen anything on the scale before, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=665.3199999999999s)]
*  and the immediate consequence was a massive tanking [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=669.0s)]
*  of stock markets and the US economy? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  Wouldn't you be raging about it? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  Now, I happen to think that this will play out [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=677.68s)]
*  probably in a way that's nowhere near as alarming [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=680.4s)]
*  as it currently seems, but that remains to be seen. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=683.48s)]
*  As things stand, there is no doubt [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=686.6800000000001s)]
*  that it's caused enormous short-term damage [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=689.6s)]
*  and volatility to the US economy and stock markets. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=692.6800000000001s)]
*  Wouldn't you be the first raging about this if it was Biden? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=695.76s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=700.12s)]
*  Well, yeah, Piers, you know why? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=701.36s)]
*  Because Biden is not Donald Trump. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=702.76s)]
*  He's not a master negotiator. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=705.16s)]
*  You can't even put two in the same breath, Piers. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=706.9200000000001s)]
*  What does Joe Biden or Janet Yellen [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=709.5600000000001s)]
*  or any of those people know about anything [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=712.12s)]
*  with business and power moves, okay? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=713.88s)]
*  I would be tripping out because I'd be like, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=716.6800000000001s)]
*  who the hell is telling him? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=717.96s)]
*  Donald Trump knows exactly what the hell he's doing, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=719.24s)]
*  and Piers, all that fear-mongering of April [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=721.48s)]
*  was the worst month the stock market saw [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=723.9200000000001s)]
*  since the Great Depression. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=726.36s)]
*  We had the biggest bounce back, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=727.64s)]
*  but nobody from the left said shit. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=729.2800000000001s)]
*  Sorry for my language, Piers. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=731.32s)]
*  I would be astonished because I'd be like, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  where'd this come from, from Biden? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=734.48s)]
*  Trump knows what he's doing, Piers, and like you said, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=736.6s)]
*  it's three months, Piers. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=738.76s)]
*  Everybody needs to calm the hell down. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=740.56s)]
*  Everything is happening. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=743.24s)]
*  The adjustment needs to happen. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=744.64s)]
*  We're gonna be fine, Piers. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=746.28s)]
*  Give it a year, give it two years. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=747.72s)]
*  We are kicking ass. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=749.64s)]
*  The rocket is taking off, Piers, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=751.0s)]
*  but everybody's worried because it's shaking on the way up. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=752.4s)]
*  Everybody needs to stop. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=755.72s)]
*  And the last point I was trying to make, Piers, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=756.56s)]
*  is no matter what he does, they're gonna complain. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=758.12s)]
*  If Trump, with the help of Elon Musk, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=761.12s)]
*  stopped an asteroid that was about to hit Earth, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=763.16s)]
*  the next day CNN and all these leftists would complain [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=765.72s)]
*  that he's polluting the world with asteroid debris. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=768.68s)]
*  He can't win. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=771.4s)]
*  He can't freaking win. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=772.52s)]
*  So Piers, I'm tired of hearing all these soft people. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=773.72s)]
*  I'm just tired. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=776.64s)]
*  It's over. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=778.28s)]
*  Nobody gives a shit anymore. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=779.16s)]
*  And why would you go to a dinner [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=780.4s)]
*  where you know the left is all gonna talk shit about you? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=781.76s)]
*  He doesn't need to do it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=783.6s)]
*  He doesn't need to show up. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=784.76s)]
*  That part is certainly absolutely true. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=785.76s)]
*  Kat, we're nearly 100 days in. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=788.0s)]
*  It'll be 100 days on Wednesday. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=790.96s)]
*  What is your overview of the Trump three-month reign, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=793.2s)]
*  so far, and people call it a reign, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=798.48s)]
*  because they think he's behaving like a monarch, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=799.9200000000001s)]
*  which I'd have no problem with, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=801.6800000000001s)]
*  but obviously Americans don't like that. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, yeah, that's part of the reason [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=806.08s)]
*  that we're not a part of England anymore. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=807.36s)]
*  I would say that it's been disastrous. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=809.6s)]
*  I mean, yesterday I was at a veterans rally [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=811.4000000000001s)]
*  for people who had been laid off from their jobs [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=813.88s)]
*  because of Musk's doge, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=816.5200000000001s)]
*  for people that aren't able to get healthcare, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=818.6800000000001s)]
*  who were exposed to tar pits overseas when they were serving, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=821.1600000000001s)]
*  for people who are struggling with the care at the VA [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=825.4s)]
*  as Musk and Trump cut it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=829.72s)]
*  And this is in the only red part in the district [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=831.08s)]
*  that I'm running in. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=833.12s)]
*  I talked to so many older people who are like, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=834.2s)]
*  I don't have a 401k anymore. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=836.64s)]
*  And as much as many wants to say, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  like wait a year, wait two years, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=840.04s)]
*  people can't wait a year or two years right now, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=841.8000000000001s)]
*  because most Americans can't afford [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=844.36s)]
*  an emergency thousand dollar expense. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=846.48s)]
*  And this isn't only limited to blue areas. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=848.88s)]
*  This is also in red ones. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=851.32s)]
*  Our allies can't trust us. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=853.8s)]
*  We seem volatile, we seem weird, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=855.92s)]
*  and we seem extreme just on the economic front. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=859.24s)]
*  And that's not even counting how many people [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=862.56s)]
*  in this country are terrified for their very existence, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=864.72s)]
*  for the existence of due process. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=868.6s)]
*  I mean, you can say, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=870.52s)]
*  well, criminals don't deserve due process. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=871.36s)]
*  Well, due process is how we decide [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=873.3199999999999s)]
*  whether or not you're a criminal. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=874.96s)]
*  We absolutely need it. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=876.52s)]
*  And the answer isn't deporting people [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=877.76s)]
*  to concentration camps overseas. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=879.68s)]
*  Okay, do you see any successes for Trump so far? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=882.12s)]
*  Ooh, good question. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=886.52s)]
*  I mean, he seems to be doing his vision as he wants. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=889.6s)]
*  He renamed a body of water. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=892.48s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Gulf of America [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=893.8s)]
*  seems like a really big win for him. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=894.64s)]
*  I'm sure that he seems to be successful. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=895.72s)]
*  No, it's a serious question. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=896.5600000000001s)]
*  I personally don't. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=897.52s)]
*  I just wanna know whether you can genuinely bring it [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=898.36s)]
*  into yourself to say, yes, he's done this really well. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=901.6s)]
*  I am genuinely thinking about this. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=906.96s)]
*  I think that there is something to be said of, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=908.88s)]
*  I personally don't like project 2025, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=912.76s)]
*  but they are accomplishing the goals in there. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=915.7199999999999s)]
*  And I don't mean that in a snarky way. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=917.7199999999999s)]
*  If that is what you want to do, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=919.5999999999999s)]
*  then they are doing that well. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=922.4s)]
*  What's extraordinary to me, see, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=924.16s)]
*  I would take everything you say a lot more seriously. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=925.8s)]
*  If you said, you know what, Piers, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=929.76s)]
*  what is indisputable is that on the Southern border, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=931.24s)]
*  there's been a 95% drop in the number of people [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=934.9599999999999s)]
*  coming over illegally. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=938.52s)]
*  It's clearly demonstrably, inarguably, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=940.1999999999999s)]
*  and nonpartisan inarguably, a fact. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=943.48s)]
*  And he should be celebrated and acknowledged for that. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=947.56s)]
*  But it's being completely ignored [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=950.64s)]
*  by many on the mainstream media. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=952.52s)]
*  This is my problem with it, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  is that the anti-Trump sentiment is always so intense [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=955.6s)]
*  that no one can even bring it upon themselves [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=959.12s)]
*  to give him credit for an obvious win for America. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=961.88s)]
*  That is an obvious win for the United States. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=964.6s)]
*  There are many other things you could quibble with [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=967.3199999999999s)]
*  and question or feel enraged by. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=970.84s)]
*  But you can't say that, Kat. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=973.36s)]
*  You can't say on the Southern border, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=974.88s)]
*  that's a big success. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=976.56s)]
*  No, I think that the way that Trump is treating immigrants, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=979.0s)]
*  this is a country that's built by immigrants. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=982.6s)]
*  My dad is an immigrant. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=984.48s)]
*  These are people pouring in illegally [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=985.8s)]
*  in their millions over the Southern border. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=987.6s)]
*  There are people that are speaking asylum. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=989.8s)]
*  And we need to have... [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=991.6s)]
*  Well, they're not all speaking asylum. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=992.44s)]
*  You know that, Kat. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=993.36s)]
*  No, bullshit. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=994.2s)]
*  You genuinely think 10 minutes... [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=995.52s)]
*  We literally just supported... [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=996.72s)]
*  Hang on, just to be clear, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=997.56s)]
*  you genuinely think nearly 10 million... [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=998.4399999999999s)]
*  Claimed asylum in El Salvador. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=999.24s)]
*  10 million people being shipped [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1000.0799999999999s)]
*  to a concentration in El Salvador. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1001.56s)]
*  We're not talking about the ones being shipped [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1003.04s)]
*  to prisons in El Salvador. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1004.48s)]
*  We're talking about the reportedly 10 million people [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1006.12s)]
*  who came over the Southern border [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1009.92s)]
*  in the Biden administration. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1011.3199999999999s)]
*  You think they're all genuine asylum seekers? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1013.0s)]
*  I think that we don't have a good enough asylum process [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1016.4s)]
*  and there are plenty that are claiming asylum [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1019.04s)]
*  and it doesn't matter whether someone is claiming asylum [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1020.9599999999999s)]
*  or not, Trump is treating them all the same. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1023.88s)]
*  I mean, he just deported a two-year-old US citizen [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1026.28s)]
*  back to Honduras who was being treated for cancer. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1029.32s)]
*  And that's the problem here, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1031.76s)]
*  is when it comes to our border issues, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1033.08s)]
*  we are focusing on... [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1035.24s)]
*  It's treated so broadly and so angrily, so hatefully. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1037.6s)]
*  And there's no difference between these people. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1043.8s)]
*  The way that this administration [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1045.92s)]
*  is treating them is inhumane. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1047.88s)]
*  Okay, Tim, you wanted to jump in there. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1049.2s)]
*  Here's... [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1050.64s)]
*  Hang on, Vinnie. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1051.48s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1052.32s)]
*  Go ahead, Vinnie. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1053.16s)]
*  I'll follow up, Vinnie. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1054.0s)]
*  Yeah, Tim, and I appreciate you both. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1055.24s)]
*  Thank you, and I appreciate it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1057.8s)]
*  First of all, that two-year-old [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1059.1200000000001s)]
*  was here with an illegal alien mother. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1061.16s)]
*  And if the mother gets deported, Piers, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1063.44s)]
*  the kids go with the mother. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1065.52s)]
*  So stop that rhetoric. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1067.04s)]
*  She is a two-year-old being treated for cancer. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1067.88s)]
*  Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1069.92s)]
*  Excuse me, I let you speak. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1072.44s)]
*  Please let me finish, okay? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1073.52s)]
*  And you're talking about, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1074.92s)]
*  when you're talking about, first of all, let me back up. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1075.84s)]
*  Americans can't afford $1,000 and they're struggling. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1078.04s)]
*  That's because of the last administration. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1080.64s)]
*  Trump just got here, that's number one. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1082.64s)]
*  Are you truly, genuinely talking about illegal? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1085.28s)]
*  You're talking about illegal immigrants, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1088.72s)]
*  illegals, that are here, that are in freaking gangs, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1091.68s)]
*  that to join the gang, they have to kill people, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1094.8s)]
*  that sell drugs, that beat the shit out of his wife. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1096.76s)]
*  We get rid of him. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1099.24s)]
*  Is that who you're sticking up for? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1100.2s)]
*  Are you honestly gonna sit here [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1101.8799999999999s)]
*  and say Trump is just doing a broad, any illegal? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1104.0s)]
*  No, it's going after the illegals, all right? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1106.64s)]
*  And you mentioned veterans. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1109.6s)]
*  I'm a United States Air Force veteran. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1110.8s)]
*  When I joined, I swore an oath to the Constitution [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1112.76s)]
*  to protect this country of enemies, foreign and domestic. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1115.96s)]
*  And I never knew, Piers, who was it domestic? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1118.92s)]
*  You know what the domestic is? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1121.32s)]
*  It's the people that flood this country with illegals. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1122.4s)]
*  They don't give a shit about a law. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1124.64s)]
*  They weaponize the justice system. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1126.52s)]
*  They try to kill our freaking president. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1128.08s)]
*  And then when he tries to kick these people out, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1129.64s)]
*  he's the mean one. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1131.56s)]
*  I'm sorry, this is an argument that you are not gonna win. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1133.0s)]
*  Okay, there's absolutely no. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1136.2s)]
*  He's talking about illegal gang members [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1137.3600000000001s)]
*  and you're sticking up for MS-13 members. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1140.04s)]
*  Have you ever encountered an MS-13 member? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1142.12s)]
*  Have you ever spoken to one of them? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1144.6s)]
*  Well, I think the problem, Vinnie... [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1145.84s)]
*  They would kick that person. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1147.1599999999999s)]
*  Hang on, hang on, I gotta come to Tim. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1148.9599999999998s)]
*  We are conflating several different issues here [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1150.6399999999999s)]
*  because the issue of people being deported, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1154.52s)]
*  many of whom are already on the deportation list [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1158.08s)]
*  and are convicted criminals, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1161.0s)]
*  some of them for murder, rape, and so on. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1162.56s)]
*  I don't think many Americans have any sympathy, I assume, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1164.6s)]
*  with those on a deportation list who've had the due process [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1168.04s)]
*  but haven't yet been deported, now being deported. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1171.32s)]
*  There is an issue about whether they should be put in prisons [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1173.72s)]
*  in El Salvador, I get that, but that's not to do [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1177.0s)]
*  with what's happened on the southern border. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1179.48s)]
*  That's a different issue altogether. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1181.2s)]
*  So Tim, let me ask you the same question. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1182.56s)]
*  You wouldn't naturally race to praise Trump or anything, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1185.44s)]
*  but can you find it in yourself to say that [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1188.2s)]
*  what's happened on the southern border is a good thing? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1190.8s)]
*  Now, I may be about to shock you with this, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1194.8s)]
*  but tallow is an exceptional moisturiser. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1196.8s)]
*  The oil in our skin shares many of the same fatty acids [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1200.0s)]
*  as tallow, making it nearly impossible to beat. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1202.8400000000001s)]
*  You can have silky soft skin, like me, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1205.72s)]
*  with an all-natural alternative. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1208.52s)]
*  It has no fillers and it's much more than just a moisturiser. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1210.56s)]
*  It can replace lotion, night cream, wrinkle cream, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1214.04s)]
*  neosporin, and much more. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1218.04s)]
*  It's powerful enough to heal your skin, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1220.0s)]
*  but it's safe enough to spread on your toast. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1222.2s)]
*  And if you're looking for natural solutions, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1224.96s)]
*  what about your toothpaste? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1227.08s)]
*  Van Man's Mint Bone Toothpowder is packed with all the minerals [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1229.24s)]
*  and the nutrients needed to remineralise teeth. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1233.24s)]
*  They use zero fluoride, SLS, glycerin, and foaming agents. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1236.92s)]
*  The aim for all of Van Man company's products is to be edible, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1241.96s)]

*  and I was happy to let my cousin Vinnie over there go. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1265.8s)]
*  I thought he was gonna explode. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1267.68s)]
*  He might've had a heart attack over there [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1268.8s)]
*  if we didn't give him a chance to talk. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1270.04s)]
*  But here's the thing, Piers, I believe that... [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1271.32s)]
*  You know, look, I used to be a Reagan Republican, all right? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1276.32s)]
*  I believed that we were a shining city on a hill. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1278.96s)]
*  I believed that we were a place where people [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1281.52s)]
*  should want to come if they're fleeing oppression. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1283.8s)]
*  If we're talking about these Venezuelans in particular, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1286.68s)]
*  they're in a communist country [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1289.44s)]
*  where they are being persecuted by a communist dictator. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1291.76s)]
*  And I think that we should have an orderly process [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1295.56s)]
*  where people should be able to come from Venezuela [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1298.1599999999999s)]
*  to this country to be refugees like so many have before, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1301.1599999999999s)]
*  like all of us have, who came to countries, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1304.56s)]
*  who came to America. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1306.6399999999999s)]
*  That is what is unique about America. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1308.32s)]
*  That's what makes America special, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1310.24s)]
*  is that everyone except for the Native Americans came here [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1312.52s)]
*  because they were looking for opportunity, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1315.84s)]
*  because they were fleeing someplace else. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1317.4s)]
*  And we created a system [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1319.4s)]
*  that was obviously totally out of control. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1321.44s)]
*  And so bringing some control to that system is fine, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1323.36s)]
*  but that doesn't mean zero people come in. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1325.52s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1328.16s)]
*  I want Venezuelans freeing communism to be able to come here. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1329.6399999999999s)]
*  We need to create a system where people can come here. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1332.84s)]
*  And you're saying that these people who are coming illegally, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1335.16s)]
*  we actually know for sure [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1337.68s)]
*  that at least a couple of the Venezuelans [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1339.68s)]
*  that were sent to El Salvador came through the legal process. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1341.96s)]
*  You might not like that process, but they used the CB1 app. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1345.16s)]
*  They said that they were refugees fleeing oppression. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1348.1200000000001s)]
*  They went to a third country. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1351.88s)]
*  In one case, a guy went to Colombia, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1353.56s)]
*  just like you're supposed to. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1355.64s)]
*  And then he was brought to Florida. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1357.04s)]
*  And that man has been sent to El Salvador. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1358.64s)]
*  Maybe he's trying to Aragua. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1360.88s)]
*  We don't know because there wasn't a court hearing. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1363.2s)]
*  I've talked a lot about the gay makeup artist, André. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1366.2s)]
*  I'm sorry, Pierce, but so I look, I want people to come. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1368.76s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1370.72s)]
*  It's not good to be zero. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1371.72s)]
*  We're America. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1373.72s)]
*  Tim, I agree with you. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1374.72s)]
*  We're not China. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1375.72s)]
*  Listen, I don't disagree with you about the due process issue. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1376.72s)]
*  And Elizabeth, what I would say, I think, against the pro-Trump argument on this, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1378.72s)]
*  is if you start to play loose with due process, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1384.72s)]
*  what happens, as Donald Trump is now realising, I think, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1388.72s)]
*  is that the stories become the stories which are about due process, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1392.72s)]
*  not what's happened on the southern border. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1396.72s)]
*  There is a clear demonstrable big success on the southern border, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1399.72s)]
*  but I'm not reading or seeing anything about that. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1403.72s)]
*  All I'm hearing about are these one or two isolated people [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1406.72s)]
*  who have not been afforded due process and where it looks unfair. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1410.72s)]
*  And my point about that is it's almost handing a victory [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1413.72s)]
*  to the jaws of defeat if you abandon due process. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1418.72s)]
*  What do you think of that argument? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1421.72s)]
*  I mean, I have a lot to say in general, but can I just ask you, Pierce, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1425.72s)]
*  do you genuinely believe that the mainstream media that we've talked [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1428.72s)]
*  a bit about now for the last 15 minutes would have given Donald Trump [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1431.72s)]
*  the win and actually written about the victory at the border, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1434.72s)]
*  regardless of what else was happening in the country? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1436.72s)]
*  No, I don't. No, I don't. I think that's part of the problem. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1438.72s)]
*  I think part of the problem with Donald Trump from day one [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1441.72s)]
*  in terms of the way the media have treated him is that they have failed [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1445.72s)]
*  to understand why he got elected. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1449.72s)]
*  He got elected because he's not a conventional politician. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1451.72s)]
*  He doesn't behave like a conventional politician. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1453.72s)]
*  The Trump hysteria raged away for four years the first time. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1455.72s)]
*  This time around, people told us it's going to be different. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1459.72s)]
*  Everyone's learned their lessons and they haven't. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1461.72s)]
*  The hysteria has blown up again about absolutely everything. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1463.72s)]
*  Now, just being in America for a month, it's sort of every morning [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1465.72s)]
*  is like a jungle of everyone going bonkers about everything Trump says [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1468.72s)]
*  and does, when actually, as with all things Trump, it's better to take [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1473.72s)]
*  a bit of time and see how things play out, because I think that's what he does. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1476.72s)]
*  I think he throws stuff up against the wall. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1480.72s)]
*  He sees what sticks and what works and what doesn't work, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1482.72s)]
*  what needs changing and so on. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1485.72s)]
*  But the problem with the kind of controlled chaos strategy that Trump deploys [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1487.72s)]
*  is that it does allow his opponents, his enemies, and I include quite a lot [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1491.72s)]
*  of people in the media who really do want to take him down. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1496.72s)]
*  Even now, you can see it. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1498.72s)]
*  It gives them a chance and an excuse to do that, and it takes away from the successes. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1500.72s)]
*  And I think on tariffs and stuff like that, I can see the big picture. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1505.72s)]
*  I think most people understand the big argument and don't disagree with it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1508.72s)]
*  It's the way he's gone about this. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1512.72s)]
*  He has to get some wins on the board, because otherwise, if in six months' [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1514.72s)]
*  time or a year's time, or as you head towards the midterms, the U.S. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1519.72s)]
*  economy is still in the doldrums and the stock market is still tanking, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1523.72s)]
*  then you're going to lose the house in the midterms, and the environment [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1527.72s)]
*  will change completely. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1531.72s)]
*  So I do think he's playing with fire here with this stuff, where he's got [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1532.72s)]
*  to get wins on the board. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1537.72s)]
*  Do you accept that? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1539.72s)]
*  I accept that, but I would argue that Donald Trump obviously, as you know, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1541.72s)]
*  is fully aware that midterms are coming up and maybe is acting like a [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1545.72s)]
*  president and not a politician worried about midterms. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1548.72s)]
*  Not everyone can be Joe Biden and try to erase student loan debt a couple [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1551.72s)]
*  weeks before the midterms to try to score themselves a win, for example. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1554.72s)]
*  Maybe that's not what Donald Trump is trying to do. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1557.72s)]
*  I think the fact is we're talking here. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1559.72s)]
*  No one is being honest. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1561.72s)]
*  That's why I brought up the dinner to begin with and the fact that they [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1562.72s)]
*  sat there and applauded themselves and lied again. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1565.72s)]
*  My fellow panelists here said that whatever Steve Bannon does is the same. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1568.72s)]
*  Number one, I don't agree. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1573.72s)]
*  But Steve Bannon goes out and says, I am a Trump supporter. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1574.72s)]
*  No one at NBC or Axios or Politico or anywhere else goes out and says I'm a [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1577.72s)]
*  Biden supporter. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1581.72s)]
*  I saw Jake Tapper a few weeks ago say, I'm not on the left, and I sat there [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1582.72s)]
*  with my jaw on the ground. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1585.72s)]
*  The fact is they believe that they are actually moderates. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1586.72s)]
*  They believe they're telling the American people the truth, and they [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1589.72s)]
*  believe they're getting away with murder because they continue to throw [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1592.72s)]
*  their own bias into everything else that they report. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1595.72s)]
*  The American people are not stupid. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1597.72s)]
*  What is sad is that the journalists in our country believe that they are. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1598.72s)]
*  They believe they can tell them how to vote and how to feel, and they will [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1601.72s)]
*  not be able to do the research for themselves. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1604.72s)]
*  Donald Trump is not worried about victories in the media because he knows [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1606.72s)]
*  the American people not only elected him to do what he's doing but can figure [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1609.72s)]
*  out what he's doing without reading through a couple of headlines in the [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1612.72s)]
*  mainstream media. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1615.72s)]
*  So no, I don't think he's worried about scoring a few wins because he [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1616.72s)]
*  believes he's scoring the exact wins he was elected to score. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1619.72s)]
*  OK, the interesting sort of sideshow at the moment to all this is the [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1621.72s)]
*  battle for the heart and soul of the Democrat Party who have got record [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1625.72s)]
*  low polling at the moment. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1629.72s)]
*  You're seeing a number of people like Gavin Newsom, Governor of [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1631.72s)]
*  California, steaming very fast to the middle ground, abandoning a lot of [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1634.72s)]
*  the more progressive, woke ideology as he goes, pretending he had nothing [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1639.72s)]
*  to do with it. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1643.72s)]
*  You're also seeing people like AOC who are out there getting more and more [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1644.72s)]
*  of the same stuff. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1648.72s)]
*  You've got people like David Hogg who says we've got to get rid of all [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1649.72s)]
*  these old timers. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1654.72s)]
*  We've got to ripple up and get some new, young, fresh blood and thinking [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1655.72s)]
*  into the party, which I would completely concur with. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1659.72s)]
*  You know, when you see the likes of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1662.72s)]
*  these others, you just think you've got to move on now and you've got to [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1665.72s)]
*  find a new, coherent voice that's going to get people to vote for it and [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1668.72s)]
*  have a view for America. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1673.72s)]
*  But it can't be the progressive left, can it? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1674.72s)]
*  Haven't we just seen with the last election an utter repudiation of a lot [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1676.72s)]
*  of what the progressive left stands for? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1681.72s)]
*  So if you end up with AOC as the standard bearer going forward, I think [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1683.72s)]
*  you end up losing again. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1688.72s)]
*  Frankly, I disagree. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1690.72s)]
*  I mean, Harris, especially after the DNC was campaigning with Liz Cheney [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1692.72s)]
*  trying to present herself as this moderate Nikki Haley, Kamala Harris [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1697.72s)]
*  voter that obviously didn't really exist or at least not in huge numbers. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1701.72s)]
*  I think what a lot of us call progressivism is really just common sense. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1706.72s)]
*  I mean, my big vision for the world is that every American should afford [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1711.72s)]
*  housing, groceries and health care with money left over to save and spend. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1716.72s)]
*  And that doesn't seem like a very high bar and it's not for any of our [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1720.72s)]
*  peer countries, but it is here. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1724.72s)]
*  And neither party is truly messaging on that. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1726.72s)]
*  I mean, you have on the right right now, you know, having tax cuts that benefit [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1730.72s)]
*  the super rich, but not the average American. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1734.72s)]
*  And these tariffs will cost the average American, I think, about $4,000 every [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1736.72s)]
*  year. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1740.72s)]
*  And as for Democrats, there are a lot of them that are more interested in [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1741.72s)]
*  their corporate donors and trying to always cater to this very like milk [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1744.72s)]
*  toast vision when both parties should be going towards that idea. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1750.72s)]
*  Housing, groceries and health care with money left over to save and take your [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1754.72s)]
*  kid to the zoo or go to the movies. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1758.72s)]
*  You know the reason, the reason people don't focus on most things or talk [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1760.72s)]
*  about them is that on the progressive left, you'll also have people at high [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1764.72s)]
*  levels of the party come out and say with a straight face, we think biological [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1768.72s)]
*  men should be in women's sport. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1773.72s)]
*  And the moment most average Americans hear that, they do what you just did. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1775.72s)]
*  They roll their eyes and go, you lot are insane. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1779.72s)]
*  And you're doing it for a different reason. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1781.72s)]
*  You're doing it because you think I'm insane for saying that. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1783.72s)]
*  But I can tell you, as somebody who's always been pretty liberal, I think [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1786.72s)]
*  that strategy was completely insane. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1791.72s)]
*  The idea that you would let your leaders go out and propagate such bullshit, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1793.72s)]
*  which most Americans with any vein of common sense, as you call it, know is [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1798.72s)]
*  bullshit, that then allows exactly what happened, the Republicans to run [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1803.72s)]
*  with that and say, look at these people, they're nuts. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1807.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I do think the Democratic Party has a messaging issue, but I [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1810.72s)]
*  think this is less about the Democratic Party and more about right-wing media, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1814.72s)]
*  which I watch and analyze for a living, or at least before I started running [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1819.72s)]
*  for Congress. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1823.72s)]
*  There's been plenty of research talking about when people transition, how it [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1824.72s)]
*  doesn't really impact their effects in sports. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1829.72s)]
*  This is a very, very, very tiny percentage. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1831.72s)]
*  No, no, it's complete bullshit. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1834.72s)]
*  I forgot. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1835.72s)]
*  Sorry, I'm sorry. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1836.72s)]
*  Can I please finish, please? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1837.72s)]
*  By the way, I'm not right-wing media in any shape or form. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1838.72s)]
*  I'm not saying you are. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1840.72s)]
*  I'm just telling you, I'm not, and I think it's bullshit. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1841.72s)]
*  The idea that it's a small thing, it's not. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1844.72s)]
*  You're seeing it more and more and more and more and more. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1846.72s)]
*  There are millions of people, young people in America, identifying as trans. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1849.72s)]
*  This problem is going to get worse and worse and worse, and the issue is about [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1853.72s)]
*  women's rights to equality and to fairness and to safety. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1857.72s)]
*  Nothing more than that. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1861.72s)]
*  It's not about trans... [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1862.72s)]
*  The amount of trans people in sports in the first place is miniscule. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1863.72s)]
*  Hang on, Kat, I want the same for trans people, but not at the expense of [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1867.72s)]
*  women's rights. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1871.72s)]
*  That's what it's about. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1872.72s)]
*  And if you can't have a Democrat party that stands up completely rock solid [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1873.72s)]
*  for women's rights, because it's far too concerned with promoting a trans [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1877.72s)]
*  agenda where it erodes women's rights, you're never going to get re-elected [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1881.72s)]
*  as a party, ever. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1886.72s)]
*  OK, this is the thing. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1888.72s)]
*  Trans people's existence and even like the 40 people that are in sports [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1890.72s)]
*  isn't the big issue with women's rights. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1895.72s)]
*  It isn't a women's rights issue at all. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1898.72s)]
*  But it becomes one when you support obvious unfairness. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1900.72s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1903.72s)]
*  Can I please finish? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1904.72s)]
*  Sure. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1905.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1906.72s)]
*  The thing here is you have Republicans right now in the state at the federal [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1907.72s)]
*  level that are saying we need to check children's genitals to make sure that [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1912.72s)]
*  the right ones before they play. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1917.72s)]
*  That's a harm to children and women. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1919.72s)]
*  The SAVE Act, which is going to stop millions of married women from being able [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1921.72s)]
*  to vote if they don't have their birth certificate and proof of their name [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1925.72s)]
*  change, that's an actual harm to women. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1928.72s)]
*  Trans people existing and in like one state that did a law against trans kids [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1930.72s)]
*  being in sports, there was literally one trans child that was in any sport who [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1934.72s)]
*  was supported by their own team. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1939.72s)]
*  This is lawmakers at the state level, people that are being paid, that are [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1941.72s)]
*  full ass adults, that are bullying children. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1945.72s)]
*  So just to be clear, you would personally like it to continue. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1948.72s)]
*  You think it's perfectly OK for biological men to compete in women's [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1954.72s)]
*  sport. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1958.72s)]
*  Is that your position? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1959.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1960.72s)]
*  I don't mind trans women being in sports. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1961.72s)]
*  Then this is the problem. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1963.72s)]
*  Cat, with respect to you, I'm very glad you're not running this issue in [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1965.72s)]
*  America because it is grotesquely unfair to women. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1971.72s)]
*  Vinny, final word to you and then I'll come to Tim for his final word. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1974.72s)]
*  She just said it. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1977.72s)]
*  You're spinning out these numbers. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1978.72s)]
*  If one man tries to take away a scholarship from a female that's anti-woman [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1980.72s)]
*  and for you to sit there and act like it's not a freaking problem, it's [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1988.72s)]
*  happening more and more like Pierce said every single day. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1992.72s)]
*  And that's the problem is this low number talk. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1995.72s)]
*  If one, one girl is being affected and if there's men in women's bathrooms, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=1997.72s)]
*  you guys make it seem like this is just we're just coming out of thin air. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2004.72s)]
*  And that's the problem, Pierce, with the Democratic Party. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2008.72s)]
*  You heard it here first. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2011.72s)]
*  No vision, no plan. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2012.72s)]
*  They're totally fine with a male with testicles beating the shit out of [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2014.72s)]
*  women, spiking lollipops in their freaking face and sending them to the [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2018.72s)]
*  hospital. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2022.72s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2023.72s)]
*  It's unbelievable that I'm happy you're exposing yourself because he [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2024.72s)]
*  nailed it. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2027.72s)]
*  This is why your party is going to keep losing over and over and over [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2028.72s)]
*  because you guys are standing on issues that it's so common sense. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2032.72s)]
*  Men should play with men. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2036.72s)]
*  Women should play with women. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2038.72s)]
*  And if you don't think it's affecting women, go ask all these girls that [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2039.72s)]
*  are losing scholarships to men with freaking testicles that are beating [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2042.72s)]
*  the shit out of them in sports. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2045.72s)]
*  It's unbelievable that you think like that. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2047.72s)]
*  Okay, Tim, I mean, I think the wider part, I don't want to really get the [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2049.7200000000003s)]
*  whole trance thing, but I think the point is as the Democrats try and [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2053.7200000000003s)]
*  find a new voice, a new way to compete and a new way to win, I just feel [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2057.72s)]
*  they have to go down the Gavin Newsom route of abandoning, just propagating [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2063.72s)]
*  all this progressive far less stuff. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2068.72s)]
*  Otherwise, they're just unelectable. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2071.72s)]
*  Yeah, so just two thoughts on this. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2074.72s)]
*  Just one really quick on the moral bankruptcy of Vinny's position. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2076.72s)]
*  I have a more nuanced view than Kat does on trans women in sports, but the [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2079.72s)]
*  idea that having one trans woman in a swimming meet is unacceptable, but I [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2084.72s)]
*  don't care if I wrongly sent, but okay, okay, but I don't care, but you don't [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2091.72s)]
*  care apparently if we wrongly sent one person to a concentration camp in [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2096.72s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2101.72s)]
*  You don't care about due process. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2103.72s)]
*  Concentration camp. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2105.72s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2106.72s)]
*  You said you don't care about due process. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2107.72s)]
*  Two different points. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2108.72s)]
*  You're complaining two different points. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2109.72s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2111.72s)]
*  Two different points. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2112.72s)]
*  And you're using the word concentration camp. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2113.72s)]
*  Tim, you're using the word concentration camp. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2115.72s)]
*  So you're one of those people that's like Trump is Hitler. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2117.72s)]
*  Again, your dumb ass party has watered down the name Hitler. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2120.72s)]
*  The name Hitler isn't even strong anymore because you know what? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2124.72s)]
*  You compare it with Trump. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2128.72s)]
*  People go, oh, if Trump is, if Hitler's like Trump, then he's not not bad. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2129.72s)]

*  Unfortunately, we have to wrap it there. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2151.72s)]
*  All I would say is, Tim, in relation to your point, Rachel, your point, Tim, I actually [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2153.72s)]
*  think it is wrong to deport people to prisons in El Salvador without proper due process. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2158.72s)]
*  Don't be in a gang, Jere. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2164.72s)]
*  Don't be in a gang. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2166.72s)]
*  Well, Vinny, I have not seen yet enough evidence for my liking that this guy was a member of [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2167.72s)]
*  that gang. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2172.68s)]
*  If there is, if there is. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2173.68s)]
*  Why would you? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2174.68s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2175.68s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2176.68s)]
*  If there is. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2177.68s)]
*  Why do they have to show you? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2178.68s)]
*  If there is, put it out there. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2179.68s)]
*  If there is, put it out there and then I may change my mind. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2180.68s)]
*  But until I see it, I'm afraid I'm not satisfied. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2183.52s)]
*  So, so, so, so, so, so you're assuming they're lying? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2186.52s)]
*  You guys think that they're lying? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2189.52s)]
*  Well, let's wait and see. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2190.52s)]
*  Are they lying, Pierce? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2191.52s)]
*  Let's wait and see. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2192.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2193.52s)]
*  You're not initial, but. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2194.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2195.52s)]
*  You guys think they're lying. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2196.52s)]
*  Well, no, Vinny, but initially. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2197.52s)]
*  Yes, they're lying to you. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2198.52s)]
*  The initial. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2200.36s)]
*  The administration. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2201.36s)]

*  Their words, not mine. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2205.44s)]

*  Take a breath, Vinny. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2213.44s)]
*  Well, moving away from politics now and to some eye catching stories in the world of [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2214.44s)]

*  and 73-year-old American football legend Bill Belichick is in the spotlight after his 24-year-old [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2231.52s)]
*  girlfriend bizarrely crashed a major television interview. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2237.48s)]
*  Well, joining me now, our rapper and commentator, Lord Jamal, the host of Determined Society, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2241.04s)]
*  Sean French, the producer and director, joke, no joke, and criminal defense attorney, Stacey [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2245.72s)]
*  Schneider. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2250.7999999999997s)]
*  Welcome to all of you. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2251.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, let's start, Stacey, with you on the legality. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2252.7999999999997s)]
*  How much trouble do you think he's in? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2256.52s)]
*  Well, he's in civil trouble, not criminal trouble, because the new lawsuit by the 19, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2258.12s)]
*  20-year-old at the time she met him, the woman who alleges that she was in a relationship [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2262.76s)]
*  with him and that she alleges there were two incidents of rape, actually, one last year [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2268.84s)]
*  in January, I believe, of this year in her lawsuit, she never went to the police, apparently. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2274.76s)]
*  I mean, there are no criminal allegations against him. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2280.16s)]
*  It does not appear he is getting arrested. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2283.36s)]
*  He's being sued for money. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2285.76s)]
*  And that's a more difficult position for the alleged victim to be in because she didn't [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2287.5600000000004s)]
*  cry out. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2291.48s)]
*  You know, we have this thing in the law, is there a prompt outcry when somebody is abused? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2292.48s)]
*  Now, that can't always happen because there are different circumstances for different [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2297.2400000000002s)]
*  types of alleged abuse. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2300.7200000000003s)]
*  But in a situation where she allegedly or presumably went back into the relationship, there's a [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2302.8s)]
*  little bit of a weakness presenting, at least early on, we're not in court yet, but at least [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2310.1600000000003s)]
*  in the lawsuit papers, there's a little bit of a weakness presenting there. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2315.52s)]
*  But he's in trouble because of his personality, his career, his reputation. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2319.64s)]
*  That's a big amount of trouble. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2326.04s)]
*  But he's not under arrest. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2328.44s)]
*  And that's a distinction here that should be pointed out. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2329.96s)]
*  OK, a joke, no joke. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2332.7599999999998s)]
*  You've I think taken a view that he was just very dumb and naive to be with this kind of [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2336.16s)]
*  girl at all. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2342.12s)]
*  Why do you feel that way? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2344.96s)]
*  I mean, for one, first, how you doing this? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2348.12s)]
*  The girl was so young. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2355.24s)]
*  I mean, at his age, he shouldn't be dealing with anyone at that age. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2357.68s)]
*  She's probably to be his granddaughter. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2362.3999999999996s)]
*  For him to be doing like, I can't defend Shana Shaw when it comes to this, just for the fact that the age of the girl. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2367.04s)]
*  How old is he now? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2378.92s)]
*  Just to be clear, how old is he? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2380.8399999999997s)]
*  He's older than me. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2384.68s)]
*  Fifty seven? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2387.16s)]
*  Fifty six, I'm hearing. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2388.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, fifty six. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2389.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2390.2s)]
*  It's a massive age gap. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2390.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, if you're famous as him, are you inviting trouble? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2393.08s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2397.24s)]
*  Of course. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2399.44s)]
*  And not to mention that she's Caucasian. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2400.44s)]
*  You know, you've got a Caucasian young girl that you're sitting around here dating and talking very crazy to. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2403.88s)]
*  And in a time where people are using the Man Act and civil lawsuits just as a come up. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2412.2799999999997s)]
*  And this is another one. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2420.72s)]
*  And he put himself in that line of in the line of fire. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2422.0s)]
*  So this is where he is. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2425.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, Lord Jamal, let's play two clips. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2428.0s)]
*  The first one is is Shannon Sharp emphatically denying wrongdoing. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2429.7999999999997s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2434.7599999999998s)]
*  To my family, friends, supporters and colleagues, I want to speak to you directly and from the heart. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2436.52s)]
*  This is a shakedown. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2442.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm going to be open, transparent and defend myself because this isn't right. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2443.7999999999997s)]
*  This is all being orchestrated by Tony Busby, who is targeted Jay-Z. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2448.2799999999997s)]
*  Tony Busby targets black men, and I believe he's going to release a 30 second clip of a sex tape that tries to make me look guilty and played into every stereotype you could possibly imagine. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2453.04s)]
*  That video should actually be 10 minutes or so. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2463.3999999999996s)]
*  Hey, Tony, instead of releasing your edit, put the whole video out. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2466.16s)]
*  I don't have it or I would myself. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2469.8399999999997s)]
*  You know what happened and you're trying to manipulate the media. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2472.08s)]
*  The encounter in question took place during the day at her invitation, and now that appears to be a deliberate setup. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2475.2s)]
*  Well, the accuser's lawyer also released an audio tape in which you can hear Sharp appearing to threaten to choke the woman in public. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2481.96s)]
*  Take a listen to that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2490.64s)]
*  Well, OK. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2492.48s)]
*  OK, what? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2496.2s)]
*  I'm not really interested. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2498.2s)]
*  And. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2504.7599999999998s)]
*  Getting choked, so I guess we're going. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2507.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I might choke you in public. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2512.56s)]
*  Big black actual small white woman. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2518.24s)]
*  It's not a good look, Shannon. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2522.6s)]
*  Not a good look that you do with the shit you did to me. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2526.52s)]
*  Lord Jamal, what is kind of complex about this is that he's sort of pulled a Justin Baldoni who's got his ongoing battle with Blake Lively. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2530.72s)]
*  He's released a lot of text messages, which at the very least put a certain different gloss on some of this, one of which I'm just reading. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2540.12s)]
*  I won't read the whole thing because it's pretty graphic and full on. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2549.52s)]
*  But it certainly appears to be an invitation from that woman to him to say that she wants him to go around and choke her while they're having sex. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2552.8s)]
*  Now, this could get very murky, very nasty between them. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2564.2400000000002s)]
*  But where do you think we are with this? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2569.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, as more and more stuff comes out, what do you feel about this case? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2571.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, how you doing, Pierce? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2577.8s)]
*  Shannon Sharp, to have a name like Sharp, this was very dull what he did with his, you know, mentally. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2581.76s)]
*  I'm going to be honest with you, I have a friend that says he saw a piece of this tape. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2590.0800000000004s)]
*  I guess the 30 seconds that they're talking about that he saw this. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2598.0400000000004s)]
*  And apparently on the tape, the young lady is vocally saying, you're choking me, you're choking me. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2601.92s)]
*  Now, do we know if this was something that she called him over there and said, I want you to do this to me? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2608.2s)]
*  And, you know, they're just framing this because, you know, you don't know what's outside of the frame. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2614.12s)]
*  That's what is really in question here. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2619.3999999999996s)]
*  But what I will tell you, the person that saw this said that part made him look very, very bad. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2623.64s)]
*  So, you know, we're going to see everything is prosecuted in the court of public opinion before it even gets to a court of law. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2630.88s)]
*  So he's not looking good in the court of public opinion right now. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2642.04s)]
*  Right. I think that's probably right. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2646.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, Sean French, you know, like all of these things, it's very messy. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2648.0s)]
*  His lawyers, when they release these text messages from the alleged victim, they are very graphic. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2653.0s)]
*  I can't even read some of it out, even on a show called Uncensored. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2660.08s)]
*  But his lawyers said this evidence presents a clear picture. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2664.7200000000003s)]
*  This was a consensual adult relationship, including role playing, sexual language and fantasy scenarios explicitly requested by the accuser. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2667.92s)]
*  And I guess it could all come down to that. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2677.76s)]
*  I mean, if there is clear demonstrable evidence, however unpalatable it seems his behaviour has been from what the clips we're seeing and hearing about him. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2679.92s)]
*  If it's then put side by side with direct entreaties from this young woman for him to do exactly that to her, where does that leave us with this case? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2690.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's a tough one, Pierce. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2703.08s)]
*  You know, I'm not going to defend what's going on, but I think the main thing to really realise is when you look at all the text messages that have been released, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2704.16s)]
*  a lot of it seemed like she was saying a lot of things to him that she wanted him to do to her sexually. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2710.96s)]
*  And then now we're here and all the stuff is being pinned against him. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2716.4s)]
*  And listen, it doesn't look good. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2719.92s)]
*  I agree with most everybody on this panel that this is not a good look. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2722.0s)]
*  You know, it's looking pretty rough for him. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2725.6800000000003s)]
*  But the main thing is that we've got to ask ourselves, when did it, where was the line drawn? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2727.88s)]
*  Right. When did he cross that line to a point where these things that were welcomed now are all of a sudden being, you know, kind of shaped in the like that he assaulted her. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2732.64s)]
*  And again, I'm not saying he's right. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2743.48s)]
*  I want to be very clear. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2745.84s)]
*  It looks bad and not a good look for Shannon Sharp. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2747.28s)]
*  But, you know, when you look at the text messages and then what was being invited and then to the actual tape, where was the confusion? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2750.96s)]
*  Or, you know, did she put a time where she said, hey, I'm not good with this anymore. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2760.08s)]
*  He took it too far. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2764.88s)]
*  I think that's what everybody's got to get down. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2765.7200000000003s)]
*  That's what we got to find out. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2767.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2768.6400000000003s)]
*  Also, it's a two year relationship. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2769.1600000000003s)]
*  This is not just a short fling. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2772.0s)]
*  There's something got wildly out of hand. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2774.84s)]
*  I mean, you know, there'll be there'll be a lot of women I know say what she put up with this for two years. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2776.68s)]
*  What's that all about? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2781.88s)]
*  There'll be other women who go, it doesn't matter. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2782.88s)]
*  You can have a 20 year relationship. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2785.4s)]
*  And if at some point that line gets crossed in the way that she claims it has into a non-consensual rape, it doesn't matter about how long we've been with each other. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2787.16s)]
*  Sure, there's a lot of nasty messages, you know, that. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2797.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2801.4s)]
*  Yeah, well, let me bring let me bring Stacey back in on that. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2802.16s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2804.68s)]
*  I mean, apparently, according to Sharpe's lawyer, they made an offer of 10 million dollars to this woman to resolve this matter without any admission of wrongdoing. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2806.2s)]
*  That was rejected. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2816.56s)]
*  And this all came amid the backdrop of a lot of reports in the media that Sharpe was about to sign a deal exceeding 100 million dollars for his club Shae Shae podcast. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2817.52s)]
*  So you've got a story swirling around the airwaves that he's about to make 100 million. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2829.28s)]
*  She's already been offered 10 million. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2834.76s)]
*  Now she's asked for 50 million. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2836.92s)]
*  You know, there will be a lot of people saying, well, she hasn't gone to the police. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2839.48s)]
*  Las Vegas police said there's no no allegation against Sharpe being investigated at all. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2843.5600000000004s)]
*  There'll be a lot of people say, including a lot of women, this is a shakedown. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2850.1600000000003s)]
*  It can be looked at that way. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2856.28s)]
*  I mean, I'm not saying it is. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2857.64s)]
*  I mean, it's got to play out in the civil court. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2859.3599999999997s)]
*  But the thing is, him offering her any sum of money is no indication that he did these alleged acts. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2862.2s)]
*  It's his way of trying to get rid of a very big problem, a very big PR problem. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2869.24s)]
*  And this is not a cut and dry case of sexual assault. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2874.7999999999997s)]
*  Like what you just brought up here is she was in a two year relationship. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2879.12s)]
*  If I were going into court on this case defending him, I would bring up every single text message, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2884.24s)]
*  email, phone call from her inviting him, implying consent, implying that she wanted to be there. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2890.08s)]
*  She was he did not come up upon her allegedly in this situation and commit acts of violence. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2897.48s)]
*  These were two people who were in the same room together by choice, apparently from everything they've said and done on tape. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2904.24s)]
*  So this is not a straightforward case. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2912.04s)]
*  It's a lot of money. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2914.4s)]
*  And I just want to say in the scheme of things, being offered 10 million dollars to settle a civil case is a lot of money. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2915.56s)]
*  To turn that down is bizarre because in a civil case, you have to prove you are damage. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2922.84s)]
*  You need medical bills. You need psychiatric bills. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2928.12s)]
*  You need things to show that these alleged acts, whether they're offensive, violent, illegal, horrible, they have to cause the alleged victim damage. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2930.36s)]
*  She's got to prove her damages. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2940.52s)]
*  That's harder in a civil case, much easier in a criminal case. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2942.64s)]
*  The crime occurred. That's all you need to prove. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2946.12s)]
*  That's the damage. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2948.64s)]
*  So it's odd that you turned down a 10 million dollar offer. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2949.92s)]
*  I also want to play a clip. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2954.56s)]
*  This is from Charlemagne the God talking about this case. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2955.64s)]
*  You know, like, you know, Shannon is 56 years old. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2960.04s)]
*  There is absolutely no reason for a 56 year old man, 54 year old man at the time to be hollering at a 19 year old. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2964.36s)]
*  Now, at 19 years old. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2970.92s)]
*  She's not 19. She's 22 now. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2972.1600000000003s)]
*  She was 19 when he met her. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2975.84s)]
*  He was 54 because a 54 year old person with that much to lose should not be talking to a 19 year old. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2977.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, listen, it may be legal, but just common sense should say, you know what, this is not what I want to be. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2983.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, no joke. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2991.4s)]
*  They went on to say that if you date an only fans model as a 99 percent guarantee, you're going to get set up at some point. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=2993.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's probably not wrong that assessment because that's somebody who's already making a ton of money out of their body and so on. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3002.1600000000003s)]
*  But putting aside what people may think, Madonna has dated men with a much bigger age gap than that. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3009.0s)]
*  So I don't think the age gap itself should be something as a stick to beat him with. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3016.6s)]
*  The real question is whether anything that he did to this young woman was actually non-consensual, as she claims, or whether it was all part of role play. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3021.88s)]
*  You know, I remember interviewing Armie Hammer, whose career was pretty well ruined in not totally dissimilar fashion by women who claimed who had long relationships with him, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3032.08s)]
*  who all claimed all sorts of fantastical things about him being a cannibal and so on and so on. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3041.48s)]
*  He showed me the text messages from one of them, which were extremely lurid and would certainly asking him to come and do all sorts of things to her, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3047.0s)]
*  which put a very different perspective to me on at least one of the women who made allegations against him. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3056.7200000000003s)]
*  And it does seem to be we've moved, you know, 30 years ago, this kind of case wouldn't happen if a woman was on record as asking for X, Y, Z and got X, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3061.88s)]
*  Y, Z. It would not be categorised as rape or non-consensual sex. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3071.36s)]
*  These days you're seeing a rise in this kind of thing against high profile people. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3077.6s)]
*  And I think that is concerning. It's not to say she's not telling the truth. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3082.08s)]
*  I don't know. I wasn't there. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3086.0s)]
*  But it is concerning when you see the juxtaposition of very lurid text messages asking Shannon Sharp to do stuff to her and then her claiming actually she didn't want this stuff done to her. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3087.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, I agree with Charlamagne with what he said with the age gap. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3101.32s)]
*  There's no reason for him to be talking to her because of the age difference. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3108.92s)]
*  And I'm disappointed in Shannon Sharp because when I was in my acting days, I did a Charles Swarbrough commercial with him. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3114.48s)]
*  So I looked up at him as this, you know, positive figure in our community. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3122.0800000000004s)]
*  But now to see him at 54, dating a 19 year old, it goes to show that he learned nothing from R. Kelly. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3130.72s)]
*  The girl Asriel Clary, her parents, Alice Clary, Angelo Clary, it was entrapment with R. Kelly. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3138.4s)]
*  It was the same thing. The girls sat there and she defended R. Kelly until she was mad at him. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3146.4s)]
*  And then she turned around and he went to jail. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3153.24s)]
*  This is the same situation with Shannon. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3156.0s)]
*  It probably was consensual in the beginning. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3158.8s)]
*  You're dealing with an immature woman that is just coming into her emotions and her feelings. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3161.56s)]
*  And you're playing a dangerous game with the age gap. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3170.04s)]
*  And this is the result of it. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3174.92s)]
*  And like I said, he did not learn from R. Kelly. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3177.0s)]
*  This is the same thing that R. Kelly is. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3179.68s)]
*  And to add on to this, it was like when we were young coming up in the industry, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3181.7999999999997s)]
*  and Lord Jamal, he could assess to this, there were the girls that, you know, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3187.64s)]
*  had their eyes on the guys that were going to be athletes like Carmelo Anthony or somebody young. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3194.12s)]
*  And the older women, they know these guys are getting ready to go pro. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3201.2s)]
*  So they prey on them and they get them. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3206.16s)]
*  And then they got a career. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3208.88s)]
*  Well, it started with the rappers, then it became the sports athletes. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3210.56s)]
*  And then they moved on to, you know, you see women, rappers like E with Billionaire Men. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3216.48s)]
*  You know, they is the elevation of the opportunity that you are. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3223.32s)]
*  And right now, this girl caught Shannon Shaw in the new hustle, which is kind of the same thing they did. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3228.7999999999997s)]
*  And now, you know, the city is going through with Cassie, allegedly. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3238.2s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. OK, so you mentioned Diddy. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3242.3999999999996s)]
*  Let me come to you, Lord Jamal, on Diddy, because his trial kicks off next week. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3244.64s)]
*  It won't be televised. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3249.3599999999997s)]
*  Some people thought it might be, but it won't be. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3250.8399999999997s)]
*  It's been announced. It's also been revealed he's turned down a plea deal. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3252.8799999999997s)]
*  So he clearly wants to have his day in court to clear his name, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3256.7999999999997s)]
*  which is, you know, interesting in itself. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3259.96s)]
*  And apparently, Lord Jamal, one of his main defences is going to be that [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3262.3199999999997s)]
*  of a kind of swinging scene. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3266.7599999999998s)]
*  His representation apparently claimed he merely engaged in swinging. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3269.64s)]
*  This was what the free coughs were all about. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3273.3999999999996s)]
*  There's a lifestyle, they say. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3276.12s)]
*  Call it swinging or whatever you will, that he thought was appropriate because it was common. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3277.48s)]
*  That's his lawyer, Mark Agnifilo, apparently argued at the courthouse. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3282.6s)]
*  So what do we make of this? Diddy didn't do a deal. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3288.0s)]
*  So clearly wants to try and clear his name, didn't want to go to jail by admitting anything. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3291.36s)]
*  And they're going to try and say that all these free cough parties were swinging. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3296.8s)]
*  I mean, it's quite possible, you know, when you just brought up Diddy and we transitioned from Shannon, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3302.2400000000002s)]
*  two things that I kind of saw in my mind at that time, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3308.6400000000003s)]
*  because we can't really ignore the racial component to this. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3315.04s)]
*  These guys kind of remind me of Jack Johnson, the boxer Jack Johnson back in the days. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3318.52s)]
*  He was a successful black man who blatantly flaunted his wealth [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3323.72s)]
*  and was having relationships with white women at a time when that was super taboo. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3329.44s)]
*  And I think, you know, within the DNA, especially here in America, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3336.52s)]
*  you know, you have certain black men that are trying to prove that, oh, I'm successful now, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3342.36s)]
*  I can do what I want to do. I can have white girls. I can have, you know, they can be as young as I want them to be. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3346.52s)]
*  I can have free cough parties. I'm free. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3351.56s)]
*  Like, you know, these are people with money that are trying to say that they're really free. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3354.36s)]
*  And the system will be like, hang on now, we don't necessarily care how much money you have. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3358.72s)]
*  Slow it up. You're still black in America. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3366.68s)]
*  And I think that's a component that, you know, it's a silent component, but it's loud at the same time. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3371.7599999999998s)]
*  OK, Sean French, I mean, I haven't I have not heard that defence of it, that it's potentially related to his skin colour. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3378.24s)]
*  Oh, not a defence. It's not a defence. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3385.4399999999996s)]
*  No, no, no. It's a possible explanation. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3387.24s)]
*  I mean, Sean French, do you think there's any merit to that? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3391.52s)]
*  Or do you think that... I mean, look, Harvey Weinstein obviously was a white guy who got brought to book. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3394.9599999999996s)]
*  Kevin Spacey got brought to book. I can think of Armie Hammer. They're all white. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3399.4s)]
*  I'm not entirely sure that the skin colour part of this carries much water, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3403.44s)]
*  given how many white guys have also been brought down since the Me Too thing certainly started. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3408.2000000000003s)]
*  But this also this wider thing of him trying to frame it as swinging the free cough parties and stuff, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3415.6s)]
*  do you think that that will carry any water? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3422.8s)]
*  I mean, I'm certainly not going to shoot down his perspective. I'm going to respect it. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3426.12s)]
*  But I think it's more about the the public eye. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3429.16s)]
*  It's more about being a big public figure and having all the money and doing whatever the hell you think you can do. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3434.24s)]
*  But it's like, I'm going to do this because I have this status. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3440.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, so to me, it's more about that. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3444.8399999999997s)]
*  And, you know, these free cough parties, swingers, hey, man, swing is not illegal. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3447.3199999999997s)]
*  It's not the lifestyle that I would want to live. Right. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3450.64s)]
*  But but the fact of the matter is, it's not illegal to do so. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3453.24s)]
*  So I don't know where the disconnect is. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3456.8s)]
*  Again, you know, we have to wait for facts of trials coming up. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3459.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't have all the documents. I don't have all the evidence. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3462.0400000000004s)]
*  But it doesn't look good. But I surely feel this is more about a public figure exercising his control on the industry because of his prominence. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3465.1200000000003s)]
*  That's the way I see it. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3474.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Stacey, from a legal perspective, it's interesting that he's turned down any kind of deal. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3476.1200000000003s)]
*  I would expect him to turn down a deal. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3483.5600000000004s)]
*  You never he's being prosecuted by the federal government. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3485.36s)]
*  It isn't a state crime. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3488.6400000000003s)]
*  And they're actually charging him with racketeering. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3490.6400000000003s)]
*  And they're alleging that he's using all of his business enterprises to transport sex workers over state lines to conduct these alleged free cough parties. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3493.52s)]
*  And so there are so many more counts than just individual alleged sexual abuse. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3504.1600000000003s)]
*  Did he like this whole scheme and the type of case that the government has brought against him is very similar to a mob case. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3509.36s)]
*  I frankly have never seen anything like it, specifically in New York, where those type of cases are brought by the federal government, you know, mob type of racketeering cases that they've turned and entertainers. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3517.1600000000003s)]
*  Alleged proclivities or whatever he's doing. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3529.6000000000004s)]
*  And I'm not diminishing it again, because we haven't seen all of the evidence. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3531.84s)]
*  We've only seen what's in the indictment. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3534.6400000000003s)]
*  I've seen that, you know, I've read part of his indictment. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3536.56s)]
*  I think it's extraordinary that the government has gone to the lengths it's gone to to allege the number of counts against him for that type of activity. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3541.6s)]
*  I'm not saying the activity is legal or illegal. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3551.12s)]
*  Again, I'm not making a judgment. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3553.16s)]
*  But just looking at it from the defense attorney perspective, the case is a little bit outrageous at the the the breadth of what they've brought and how broad it is. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3554.52s)]
*  And his defense of saying for now that this is something I can do with my money, that will be a legitimate defense. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3566.4s)]
*  But because the government has cornered him on so many other allegations by involving these allegations against using sex workers and transporting them into the parties, he's facing a very tough battle. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3576.76s)]
*  So I don't blame him for not taking a deal because that deal would not have been an easy, sweet deal. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3590.52s)]
*  But it would have been a lot of time involved in whatever the government has offered him. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3595.8s)]
*  OK, a joke, no joke. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3599.36s)]
*  Just when you thought it couldn't get worse for him, Kanye West has raced to his defense, which I suspect will not be very helpful. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3600.7200000000003s)]
*  But one thing I thought was really particularly disturbing really was the the way that Kanye framed the security camera footage of Diddy clearly attacking his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3609.28s)]
*  We all saw it with our own eyes what he was doing. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3622.4s)]
*  And Kanye tweeted, When a man truly loves a woman, he may express it in rage. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3625.28s)]
*  I empathize with both sides. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3631.92s)]
*  You have to truly get to be you have to be truly in love to get to the point of risking everything. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3634.6800000000003s)]
*  And then he's released a track that appeared to feature a recording of Diddy speaking from jail in which Kanye West talks to him, says, I love you so much, just like you raised me. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3640.7200000000003s)]
*  Even when I didn't know you, Diddy responds, saying, I feel the love, man. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3649.48s)]
*  So full on defense. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3653.7999999999997s)]
*  But this idea that when a man truly loves a woman, he might beat her up is for the birds, isn't it? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3656.04s)]
*  I mean, I don't know any man personally who would think that is a way to express love for a woman. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3663.08s)]
*  No, I don't agree with that at all. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3670.8399999999997s)]
*  And we know Kanye has been doing all that for attention. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3673.08s)]
*  But to give back that, just to echo on the Diddy thing real quick. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3678.2s)]
*  I'm going to a Lord Jamal said, the man that I don't know if Harvey Weinstein and these other guys are what you charge with the man. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3682.68s)]
*  And you know, that's the difference in them being convicted for similar allegations, because the man that is what they use to arrest not only Jack Johnson, Chuck Berry, but R. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3691.8799999999997s)]
*  Kelly. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3708.9199999999996s)]
*  And they use it against Diddy. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3709.64s)]
*  R. Kelly was hit with the man act. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3711.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's the same thing like Stacey said, just because it's the swing of lifestyle. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3715.08s)]
*  That's the same thing with R. Kelly, because it was Asriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3721.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3728.68s)]
*  So that's how they got R. Kelly with using the man act for it to charge him with a RICO, which she said, which was in New York State, which is a mob thing. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3729.24s)]
*  Like you got a rock star going to jail for a rock star lifestyle. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3740.68s)]
*  Yeah, but maybe, yeah, but isn't the point that he might have been behaving like a mobster if he really was, you know, racketeering and trafficking girls over state lines and so on, then he's not behaving. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3746.7599999999998s)]
*  But he's not behaving. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3759.08s)]
*  Listen, we haven't seen the evidence yet. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3759.8799999999997s)]
*  What we do know is the feds have a pretty well, almost 100% record of nailing people when they come after them like this. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3762.44s)]
*  So I am very curious to see what the actual evidence is. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3768.92s)]
*  I mean, the conviction rate is high because most of those people plead guilty. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3772.36s)]
*  Now R. Kelly was offered 10 years. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3777.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, also because the evidence is often overwhelming. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3779.48s)]
*  So I think we've got to. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3785.08s)]
*  And it's very, sorry, I mean, it's very, very hard to beat a federal case in the Southern District of New York. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3785.8s)]
*  They are airtight. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3791.16s)]
*  They dot their eyes. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3792.76s)]
*  They cross their teeth. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3793.8s)]
*  That's the point. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3794.84s)]
*  They don't bring an indictment. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3795.4s)]
*  So I think we have to wait. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3796.36s)]
*  I think we have to. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3797.32s)]
*  Look, we did. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3798.04s)]
*  The good news is the speculation will end quite soon and we will have it all laid bare in a courtroom. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3799.56s)]
*  But my suspicion is that the feds have only brought this case because they believe it's a watertight case of him actually trafficking girls over state lines to perform criminal activity. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3805.88s)]
*  And by doing so, and if that's, that may not be true. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3817.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3822.36s)]
*  It may not be true. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3822.6800000000003s)]
*  But I think we should now probably wait and see what emerges in court before we all hang. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3823.96s)]
*  So you're telling me R. Kelly was trafficking those two girls? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3828.52s)]
*  Those were his girlfriends. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3832.44s)]
*  Well, in R. Kelly's case, wasn't one of them underage? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3833.8s)]
*  Wasn't that the issue? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3836.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but she was 18. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3839.1600000000003s)]
*  But her parents lied. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3841.7200000000003s)]
*  She lied. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3843.88s)]
*  Everybody lied. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3845.2400000000002s)]
*  And then the court in New York State law, they didn't allow the parents to be subpoenaed to court to testify. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3846.2000000000003s)]
*  How do you got a case about an underage girl, but you don't allow the parents to testify? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3854.44s)]
*  Well, okay. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3859.8s)]
*  We haven't got time to talk about R. Kelly. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3861.48s)]
*  You raise an interesting point. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3863.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm really, really curious to see what comes out in court because it's going to be fascinating to see. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3864.36s)]
*  But as far as Kanye goes, Kanye is only supporting Diddy for attention. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3869.32s)]
*  Of course he is. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3874.84s)]
*  Kanye, listen. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3875.4s)]
*  Let me be quite clear about Kanye West. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3877.32s)]
*  Kanye West is a fucking idiot. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3880.28s)]
*  Pardon my French. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3885.4s)]
*  Kanye West is a fucking idiot. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3886.36s)]
*  He should not be allowed anywhere near social media. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3889.0s)]
*  He should not be allowed near any social media platform. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3892.36s)]
*  He has gone completely nuts. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3896.36s)]
*  He is deliberately abusing, insulting, harassing, threatening, defaming anyone he can think of for attention. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3898.44s)]
*  Including himself. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3906.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, including himself. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3907.56s)]
*  He's wrecking his own reputation minute by minute. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3908.84s)]
*  But I actually think he's broken every rule that X has, for example. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3912.76s)]
*  Five million people a year or accounts get suspended by X for a lot less than what he's been doing. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3917.1600000000003s)]
*  And so it's completely baffling to me why Elon Musk allows him to continue doing this stuff. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3923.2400000000002s)]
*  In often, in some cases, lawlessly. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3928.92s)]
*  He breaks the law with impunity. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3931.1600000000003s)]
*  Threatening and harassing Jewish people and so on. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3933.4s)]
*  Anyway, that's for another time. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3935.4s)]
*  I want to end just with something a little lighter but totally bizarre. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3937.16s)]
*  This is a clip of Bill Belichick, obviously the great NFL coaching legend. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3940.52s)]
*  He was on CBS and they played this clip from the interview. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3946.7599999999998s)]
*  Jordan was a constant presence during our interview. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3952.92s)]
*  You have Jordan right over there. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3956.3599999999997s)]
*  Everybody in the world seems to be following this relationship. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3959.56s)]
*  They've got an opinion about your private life. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3962.2799999999997s)]
*  It's got nothing to do with them, but they're invested in it. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3964.12s)]
*  How do you deal with that? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3967.48s)]
*  Never been too worried about what everybody else thinks. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3969.48s)]
*  Just try to do what I feel like is best for me and what's right. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3971.96s)]
*  How did you guys meet? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3975.24s)]
*  Not talking about this. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3977.0s)]
*  No? [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3978.7599999999998s)]
*  No. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3979.3199999999997s)]
*  It's a topic neither one of them is comfortable commenting on. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3980.04s)]
*  Though Hudson has recently posted about it on Instagram. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3983.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean this on every single level, Sean, this is utterly ridiculous. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3988.04s)]
*  Apart from we talked about an age gap earlier. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3992.8399999999997s)]
*  The age gap. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3995.64s)]
*  Belichick is 73. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3996.2s)]
*  She's 24. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3998.28s)]
*  So he's 49 years older than she is. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=3999.56s)]
*  I thought ever since they started holding hands in public it was utterly ridiculous. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4002.36s)]
*  An age gap even Madonna would shy away from. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4006.84s)]
*  Then to watch this interview, watch this guy whose reputation is one of the [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4010.76s)]
*  hardest, toughest, meanest, most successful coaches in the history of American football [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4015.0s)]
*  getting bossed around by this girl about what he can and can't say. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4021.56s)]
*  And the utter hypocrisy of Miss Hudson posting all over her Instagram endless stuff about [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4025.24s)]
*  their relationship and then saying we're not talking about that. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4032.2s)]
*  Well they would just ask when did you meet? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4035.32s)]
*  All of it is preposterous. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4038.36s)]
*  I said on X yesterday, I mean it today. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4040.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it's time his family and friends did an intervention. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4042.84s)]
*  Save him from himself. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4047.48s)]
*  Also from that sweatshirt. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4049.48s)]
*  Somebody should save him from that interview. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4050.7599999999998s)]
*  He loves holy sweatshirts guys. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4053.64s)]
*  He loves that stuff. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4055.3199999999997s)]
*  So bizarre. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4056.2s)]
*  Sean, am I being unfair? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4059.3199999999997s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4061.88s)]
*  Look, this whole thing is big, right? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4063.0s)]
*  I mean you're talking about the most prominent coach potentially in NFL history. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4065.24s)]
*  Anything he does is going to be amplified. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4069.64s)]
*  People are going to pay very close attention. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4072.2s)]
*  The dude won how many Super Bowls? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4075.16s)]
*  And now he's potentially going to go win national championships at UNC and then brings a 24 year old [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4076.84s)]
*  girl, right? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4082.5200000000004s)]
*  Or woman, sorry, onto the field and most in in in allowing her to become part of football operations. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4083.48s)]
*  And and listen, if she was employed by the university to do so, cool. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4090.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean there's many amazing women sportscasters, but this woman is going for attention. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4095.1600000000003s)]
*  And the bottom line is my first knee jack knee jerk reaction to that whole thing is like, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4101.320000000001s)]
*  why are you even asking about his relationship? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4106.04s)]
*  How y'all met? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4109.24s)]
*  I mean this is the the best coach ever. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4110.04s)]
*  Like let's have him on this show and talk about what really matters. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4112.76s)]
*  But then I sat back and looked at it. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4116.6s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, they're going to draw attention to them. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4117.96s)]
*  People are going to ask about it. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4121.88s)]
*  Honestly, it's too big of an age gap. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4124.28s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4126.36s)]
*  Look, Lord Jamar. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4127.08s)]
*  Go get your boy, man. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4128.6s)]
*  Yeah, Lord Jamar. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4129.8s)]
*  A guy that age, of course he can date a young woman. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4131.56s)]
*  We've seen millions of these stories of Hugh Hefner onwards. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4134.92s)]
*  Of course he can if he wants to. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4137.72s)]
*  But don't expect not to be ridiculed. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4139.32s)]
*  Particularly, I mean, I thought it was amazing that CBS showed us that footage, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4141.639999999999s)]
*  which clearly they never imagined Bella Chicken and his girlfriend would be released that way. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4145.8s)]
*  I would think. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4151.08s)]
*  But so toe-curlingly embarrassing, wasn't it? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4152.599999999999s)]
*  It definitely was. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4156.599999999999s)]
*  I think she didn't want him to answer that question because the answer would have been [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4157.639999999999s)]
*  Chuck E. Cheese. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4162.12s)]
*  Come on, man. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4164.2s)]
*  Ski ball, bro. Ski ball. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4168.5199999999995s)]
*  Now, what baffles me, though, is Bill Belichick as a coach, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4170.679999999999s)]
*  you're supposed to be cerebral. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4175.96s)]
*  You're supposed to be able to dissipate. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4177.639999999999s)]
*  How can he not say what's happening? [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4180.04s)]
*  And even a Shannon Sharp. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4181.72s)]
*  These guys are sports legends. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4184.44s)]
*  That's not just physical things. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4186.5199999999995s)]
*  There's so much mental stuff that goes into this. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4188.04s)]
*  How are you so stupid to let somebody almost 50 years younger than you boss you around [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4191.16s)]
*  and tell you what to do and just not see that this is like a money play? [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4198.599999999999s)]
*  She only wants you for your money. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4203.32s)]
*  Do you think this guy is really satisfying? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4204.84s)]
*  You never know in this era of Viagra. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4210.599999999999s)]
*  I did think that also. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4218.12s)]
*  How is he doing that? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4219.32s)]
*  It's a bad visual. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4220.2s)]
*  We don't want to think too much about Bill and his Viagra stash, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4222.28s)]
*  but I just think that it was the fact that she felt she could control Stacey, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4224.679999999999s)]
*  a CBS interview about their life, given how much of their life she's put out there already. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4229.16s)]
*  I just thought it was ridiculous. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4234.44s)]
*  Yes, but he's bringing that to the table for his interview. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4238.04s)]
*  He is controlling that interview and letting her control that interview. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4242.92s)]
*  So it is a matter of his choice. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4247.0s)]
*  But I look at it a little differently. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4248.84s)]
*  A man's in power and a man is wealthy. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4251.64s)]
*  He can do whatever he wants. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4254.92s)]
*  And who are we to criticize him? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4256.6s)]
*  If he wants to date someone who's crazy, I'm sorry, I don't mean crazy. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4259.08s)]
*  That was me before Ian. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4262.84s)]
*  She looked pretty crazy to me. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4263.64s)]
*  The situation is crazy. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4265.32s)]
*  She thinks she can get CBS to do that without any fool-out. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4268.92s)]
*  She's nice. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4272.4400000000005s)]
*  I take that back. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4272.76s)]
*  Yes, I thought that her statement was crazy. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4273.8s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4276.12s)]
*  If he wants to do that, more power to him at that age that he can get away with dating [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4277.08s)]
*  a girl like that and letting her rule the roost. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4281.48s)]
*  So why put him down? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4284.28s)]
*  Let him enjoy his life. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4285.48s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you why. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4286.52s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4287.24s)]
*  Okay, but I said, all right, but look, joke, no joke. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4288.92s)]
*  The reason I said it's time for an intervention, I think we all know how this movie ends. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4292.12s)]
*  And it doesn't end well for Bill, right? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4296.92s)]
*  If anybody seriously think these two are going to be together in a year's time or whatever, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4299.48s)]
*  I think they're living in cloud cuckoo land. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4304.6s)]
*  I just think the whole thing is deeply embarrassing. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4306.52s)]
*  And I'd imagine his family and friends are like completely nonplussed about what he's doing. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4309.160000000001s)]
*  He's one of the most smart people in American sporting history. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4314.68s)]
*  He's an absolute hero. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4319.320000000001s)]
*  And yet here he is making a complete fool of himself. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4321.080000000001s)]
*  But he doesn't think he's making a fool of himself. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4324.76s)]
*  He's enjoying the ride. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4326.68s)]
*  He may not, but I wonder. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4327.4800000000005s)]
*  I know love is blind, but joke, no joke. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4329.64s)]
*  Love may be blind, but sometimes when you watch back a clip like that, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4331.8s)]
*  it is humiliating for Bill Belichick. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4335.72s)]
*  And I feel for him, I don't want his reputation to continue to be destroyed like this. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4337.96s)]
*  And if I were close to him, I'd be like, mate, this is crazy. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4343.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4349.639999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't think he's crazy. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4350.12s)]
*  I think that there's some times with men that they may, he may not even be [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4351.96s)]
*  romantically involved with or it may not even be intimacy. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4361.0s)]
*  But he might see something in this young lady that as the person that he is, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4365.16s)]
*  because we know he's intelligent, right? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4370.2s)]
*  You know he's smart. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4373.24s)]
*  And he might just see something in this young lady that he wants to empower. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4374.44s)]
*  Sometimes us as men, you know what I'm saying? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4380.5199999999995s)]
*  You might date a younger woman and have no intentions of being with her in that way. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4384.2s)]
*  But she may come from a different type of lifestyle and you just want to show her [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4391.32s)]
*  something different. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4396.599999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4397.88s)]
*  And you know what? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4398.759999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying, you know what? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4399.88s)]
*  I think I know what he's doing. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4400.679999999999s)]
*  Joe, no joke. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4402.599999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I don't think I do know what you're saying. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4403.4s)]
*  I think it's completely insane. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4405.719999999999s)]
*  You lost me, bro. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4407.88s)]
*  I love you, man. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4409.0s)]
*  But I'll be honest with you. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4409.639999999999s)]
*  I just think my instincts about these things are really, really wrong. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4411.16s)]
*  I don't think you should either marry this girl or have children with this girl. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4415.719999999999s)]

*  I will stake my entire reputation and what's left of it on that never happening. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP3WWs0X6hc&t=4420.68s)]
