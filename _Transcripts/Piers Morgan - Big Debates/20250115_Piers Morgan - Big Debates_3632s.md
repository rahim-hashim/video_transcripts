# "He's a W*NKER!" Pete Hegseth, Trump Hostage Deal & LA Wildfires
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM)
*  I'm a change agent and a threat to them because Donald Trump was willing to choose me, to empower me, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=0.0s)]
*  to bring the Defense Department back to what it really should be, which is war fighting. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=5.36s)]
*  I think he's going to reform the military very quickly and I think we're going to get back to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=9.52s)]
*  having a functioning military that people can be proud of rather than counting, you know, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=14.08s)]
*  how many lesbian generals that wear dog collars we have. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=18.32s)]
*  I spent more than 10 years at Fox News. I don't think I'm qualified to run the DOD. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=21.12s)]
*  The most egregious accusation you make against him though is that he's an extremist because he [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=25.6s)]
*  has a tattoo. Could you tell us what the tattoo is? Oh my lord. Breaking news, Donald Trump has [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  gone on his true social platform. We have a deal for hostages in the Middle East. They will be [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=36.24s)]
*  released shortly. Thank you. Whether it's Trump who does it, whether it's Biden who does it, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  the war has to end. What did Gavin Newsom do to prevent this? He did absolutely nothing. I'm sure [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=45.44s)]
*  you all saw the video of that woman coming up to him. Am I allowed to use the word that starts [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=52.4s)]
*  with W on your show? Absolutely. He's a wanker. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  Pete Haysa faced the Senate yesterday as head for confirmation as the US Secretary of Defense. He'll [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=63.44s)]
*  lead a department of three million people at a budget of 800 billion dollars. Ultimately, he'd [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=68.96s)]
*  be responsible for ensuring the world's most powerful military is ready, trained and equipped [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=73.28s)]
*  to meet any emergency and fight any war. While listening to some of the questions he faced, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=77.68s)]
*  he'd be forgiven the thinking he was auditioning to be a spiritual leader. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=81.6s)]
*  I assume that in each of your weddings you've pledged to be faithful to your wife. You've taken [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  an oath to do that, haven't you? Senator, as I've acknowledged to everyone in this committee, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  not a perfect person, not claiming to be. But no, I just asked a simple question. You've taken an [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=95.28s)]
*  oath like you would take an oath to be Secretary of Defense in all of your weddings to be faithful [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  to your wife. Is that correct? I have failed in things in my life and thankfully I'm redeemed [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=102.8s)]
*  by my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Well, the Democrat Senator Tim Kaine, who endorsed Bill [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=108.48s)]
*  Clinton for president and campaigned as Hillary Clinton's running mate. I wonder if he asked [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  same questions of them. If past marital problems are now a barrier to entry for government service, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk's cost-cutting mission is probably going to get a lot easier. There may not be [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=123.12s)]
*  many senators left. Hexham was also grilled on his past statements that women should not serve in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=127.36s)]
*  frontline combat roles and was accepted in a nomination. He's made clear that women can [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=132.24s)]
*  serve in those roles provided they meet the same standards as men. That's an inherently common [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=136.32s)]
*  sense position but not for Senator Elizabeth Warren. Some of our greatest warriors are women [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  and use support having them serve in combat. Now, that is a very, very big about face in a very, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=149.6s)]
*  short period of time. So help me understand Mr. Hegseth, what extraordinary event happened [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  in that 32-day period that made you change the core values you had expressed for the preceding [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=169.76s)]
*  12 years? Senator, again, I very much appreciate you bringing up my comments from 2013 because [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  for me this issue has always been about standards. Unfortunately, because of some of the people that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=189.36s)]
*  have been in political power for the last four years, priorities other than standards, lethality [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=195.52s)]
*  and meritocracy have driven decision making. I'm quoting you from the podcast. It went on and on [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=201.12s)]
*  like that. She really didn't let him answer. It was more about the gotcha. Yes, Hegseth has clearly [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=208.72000000000003s)]
*  sovereign his position in order to secure a job. That's how this whole politics thing works. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=214.4s)]
*  Politics and power are not puritanical. It's about getting things done. If you trade 25% of your [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=219.68s)]
*  vision for 75% of your plan, it's normally a pretty good result. There are plenty of question [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=225.12s)]
*  marks about Pete Hegseth's qualifications for this job at a time when the modern world was [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=229.68s)]
*  seldom felt more dangerous. But there wasn't the tone for most of his hearing. At times both sides [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=233.76s)]
*  seemed bent on grandstanding and using headsets to score political points. I thought he hit Manet [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=238.32s)]
*  on the head when he said this. Unlike the current administration, politics should play no part in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=243.36s)]
*  military matters. We are not Republicans. We are not Democrats. We are American warriors. Our standards [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=250.24s)]
*  will be high and they will be equal, not equitable. That's a very different word. We need to make sure [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=258.32s)]
*  every warrior is fully qualified on their assigned weapons system. Every pilot's fully qualified and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  current on the aircraft they are flying and every general or flag officer is selected for leadership [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=273.04s)]
*  or promotion purely based on performance, readiness and merit. So is Pete Hegseth the man for the job? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  Will Senator Marco Rubio make America safe again as Secretary of State? Did Trump just seal the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  Israel Hamas ceasefire? He's literally just written on social that the deal has been agreed [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  and as Los Angeles braces for more winds and warnings of extreme danger, who will be held [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=298.32000000000005s)]
*  accountable for disaster in failed preparation? Joining me to debate all this, the host of The [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=302.56s)]
*  Michael Noll Show on daily wire, Michael Nolls, Dave Rubin, host of The Rubin Report, Wajahat Ali, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=306.88s)]
*  the host of Democracy-ish and Julie Roginski, the Democrat strategist and author of the Salty [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=312.4s)]
*  Politics newsletter. Okay, well welcome to all of you, a stellar panel if I may say so, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  and happy new year to you all. Let me start with Dave Rubin. I watched most of Pete Hegseth's stuff [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=323.2s)]
*  yesterday and all I kept thinking to myself, I've got a lot of military in my family, my brother was [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=329.28s)]
*  a British army colonel, my sister married a British army colonel, my grandfather was a decorated [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=333.52s)]
*  commando, my great uncle was a decorated war hero and so on. So I watched with great interest, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  thinking one thing, if I was in the US military would I feel good or bad about what I heard from [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  Pete Hegseth and I concluded I'd be pretty happy that I had a guy there who not only had served his [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=351.84s)]
*  country for a long period with great personal courage himself but seemed to really understand [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=357.6s)]
*  what is required from a military and also seemed to pride actual meritocracy over mediocrity or [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=364.8s)]
*  virtue signaling or box ticking or DEI or any of these things and I thought yeah if I'm in the US [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=373.6s)]
*  military I think I'd probably like this guy being at the top of the pyramid. What did you think? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=379.36s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right and I can speak as someone that's on this side of the pond that I [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=384.96s)]
*  have friends and family in the military and they're happy about this too. You know there's two things [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=389.36s)]
*  going on with Hegseth here despite the I would say hysterical virtue signaling of some of the senators [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=393.28s)]
*  that you just showed there. The things are that he's qualified, there's very little question about [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=398.8s)]
*  his qualifications but the other thing that I think is really allowing him to shine right now [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=403.52s)]
*  is his decade plus time at Fox News where he is able as a TV presenter, that's what he's been [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  and a talk show host, he's able to communicate these ideas clearly when he went out of his way [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=414.64s)]
*  to talk about equality and not equity and that we should have meritocracy and its qualifications [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=420.64s)]
*  that should matter. These are all of the important things that we need to reintegrate not only into [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  the military in America very obviously instead of lowering our standards and caring about skin [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=431.52s)]
*  color and genitals and sexuality but we need to reintegrate it across all of our institutions. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=436.96s)]
*  That's the work for the broader Trump administration but I think Hegseth, well we also know he's going [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=442.08s)]
*  to pass. I mean Boone who's the majority leader has already said it. I mean it's basically a done [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=447.35999999999996s)]
*  deal already but I think he's going to reform the military very quickly and I think we're going to [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=452.79999999999995s)]
*  get back to having a functioning military that people can be proud of rather than counting [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=457.84s)]
*  you know how many lesbian generals that wear dog collars we have. As important as that is Michael [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=462.48s)]
*  Knowles. Why are you pointing at me? Hold on. I'm not going to bring that allegation to the fore [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  before we have a senate inquiry. Let me go to Mujahid. Mujahid, I mean I've heard the criticisms [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=472.88s)]
*  about Pete Hegseth. I know him a bit from when I've done stuff with Fox. He's always been [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=478.88s)]
*  perfectly good to me and always I thought a very good performer on television but I also thought [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=482.8s)]
*  that under fire yesterday and some of you got a bit personal and ferocious, he conducted himself [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  calmly. He seemed very well informed. He clearly has some opinions about the military which others [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=493.91999999999996s)]
*  may not share but I certainly didn't get a feeling of somebody out of his depth and when you actually [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=498.79999999999995s)]
*  look at people who've held that job in the past, yes some have been generals but they can be pretty [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=503.91999999999996s)]
*  intransigent sometimes in their view about how things should be and some have not been generals [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  and are immediately less qualified than Pete Hegseth. So what was your view? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=512.88s)]
*  Look I know that Republicans actually like affirmative action because they're perfectly [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=518.48s)]
*  fine with mediocre magna man and lowering the standards to the point where Pete Hegseth, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=522.32s)]
*  a Fox News host, can slither under it and be the Secretary of Defense. For people who don't know, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=526.24s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense overlooks a budget of over 900 billion dollars, three million people. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=530.88s)]
*  He is responsible in particular for defense policy making. We're talking about law and order, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=535.36s)]
*  national security. You're going to give it to Pete Hegseth, a man who was in the National [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=539.6s)]
*  Army Guard. His fellow colleague in the Guard looked at his tattoos and actually reported [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=543.28s)]
*  him to be an insider threat because it was so extreme. This is a man who wrote a book called [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=549.12s)]
*  American Crusade. In his book, Pete Hegseth said, I am too extreme for the U.S. military. In his [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=552.32s)]
*  book, Pete Hegseth said, I support these militias, these paramilitary forces. In his book, he calls [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  the enemies liberals extremists. So much for unity. This is a man not just adultery, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=564.16s)]
*  but sexual impropriety. He has been alleged of sexual impropriety and sexual assault. If he has [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=568.9599999999999s)]
*  nothing to hide, release the woman that he has signed to an NDA and paid off. Let her tell her [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  story. This is a man whose own mother sent one of the most damning emails I have ever heard and read [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=579.12s)]
*  in my life. If your mother sends the email that Pete Hegseth's mother said you have failed in life, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=584.64s)]
*  accusing him of being a sexual abuser. A man whose own Fox colleagues have said, allegedly in the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=588.8s)]
*  New York Times, that they are worried about his alcoholism and alcohol problem and a man who has [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  economic impropriety allegations. He was released from two nonprofits. What are we doing here, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=599.3599999999999s)]
*  Piers? Listen, with Marco Rubio, I disagree with him. You don't see me here complaining. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=604.64s)]
*  Qualified guy, intelligent guy, Secretary of State, fine. Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=609.12s)]
*  what are we doing? You guys are putting lipsticks on a pig and you're making America less safe. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=614.96s)]
*  And the right wing in MAGA is doing this for Pete Hegseth. You're making this country less safe [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=619.44s)]
*  just because you're bending the knee to Donald Trump and he wants a lap dog, who by the way, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=624.64s)]
*  I'll agree with Dave on this, who's good on TV. So that's what we're going to do. We're going to [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=628.72s)]
*  trade our national security for Pete Hegseth, release the woman from the NDA, I want to hear [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=633.36s)]
*  from the woman. Secretary of Defense, let's defend women for Pete Hegseth. That's my take. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=637.76s)]
*  You made your point. Any negatives while we're at it? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=641.68s)]
*  He was a joke. It was a joke. It was a joke. I'm not going to take that seriously. Let me [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=646.4799999999999s)]
*  bring Michael in here. I mean, look, a whole list of stuff there, almost all of which was put to [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=652.2399999999999s)]
*  Pete Hegseth. I thought he actually batted away all of that stuff. We've got a clip actually of [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=656.64s)]
*  him batting away one. I'll just take a look. All they were out to do, Mr. Chairman, was to destroy [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=661.28s)]
*  me. And why do they want to destroy me? Because I'm a change agent and a threat to them because [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=666.8s)]
*  Donald Trump was willing to choose me, to empower me, to bring the Defense Department back to what [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=672.56s)]
*  it really should be, which is war fighting. So I'm willing to endure these attacks, but what I will [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=677.3599999999999s)]
*  do is stand up for the truth and for my reputation. False attacks, anonymous attacks, repeated ad [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=683.04s)]
*  nauseam, printed as nauseam, as facts. We have provided to the committee, Mr. Chairman, and I [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=690.8s)]
*  know you're going to share, on the record statement after on the record statement from people who have [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=697.28s)]
*  served with me, worked with me at Fox News, Concern Vets, Vets for Freedom, you name it, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=702.0799999999999s)]
*  from the top of the chain to the bottom, who will say I treat them with respect, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=707.92s)]
*  with kindness, with dignity. That's men, that's women, that's black, that's white, that's every [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=712.56s)]
*  background. I have prided myself as a leader of respecting people, being professional. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=719.04s)]
*  Michael, I thought that was quite an effective response really because a lot of it is just [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=725.4399999999999s)]
*  innuendo. Here's say unsubstantiated allegation, other stuff has been settled as what Jahat says, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=729.36s)]
*  that's not uncommon in America. It's incredibly common for people to do NDA settlements or [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=736.8s)]
*  whatever with no blame or liability attached. Where do you sit with this? I mean, it looks like [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=742.88s)]
*  Hegseth is going to get- I don't know about you, that's not common. Sorry? That's not common, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=747.52s)]
*  not for me, I don't know about you, but that's not common. I'm not saying for you or me. There's a [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=752.24s)]
*  police report where I sexually assaulted a woman and I signed her to an Indian, but okay. In America, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=755.28s)]
*  that kind of settlement is not uncommon, is my point. Just generally, in the American system, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  a lot of things get settled that way without any admission of liability or wrongdoing, which is [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=763.36s)]
*  the case with Pete Hegseth. Michael, where do you sit with this? Well, so much of what YJHAD just [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=767.36s)]
*  said is not true or as you point out, Pierce is completely unsubstantiated, like the allegations [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=772.88s)]
*  that Pete Hegseth shows up drunk to work. Absolutely true. I've been, excuse me one second, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=778.0s)]
*  YJHAD. I've been on that morning show with Pete a number of times, I've been in studio with him [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=781.04s)]
*  a number of times. The only thing you could accuse Pete of is being too alert and energetic. I found [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=785.36s)]
*  it overwhelming actually while I was there, tired, trying to dust the sand out of my eyes. But you [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=790.4s)]
*  suggest that the graduate of Princeton and Harvard, who for decades has been in the US military, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=796.4s)]
*  served his country honorably, that he's somehow unqualified to work at the Pentagon. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=801.52s)]
*  The most egregious accusation you make against him, though, is that he's an extremist because [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=807.6s)]
*  he has a tattoo. Could you tell us what the tattoo is? The tattoos, specifically, I did not make the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=812.3199999999999s)]
*  allegation that he's an extremist. It was actually a fellow colleague who called him an insider threat. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=819.52s)]
*  Yeah, right. So what's the tattoo? It was not me. It was his fellow colleague. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=825.4399999999999s)]
*  Let YJHAD answer. YJHAD raised the tattoo. YJHAD, it's a fact question. What is this tattoo that you're so upset about? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  I mentioned the facts. It was his colleague. Wait, wait, wait. YJHAD, hang on. Simple question. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=837.2800000000001s)]
*  What is this tattoo that you're so upset about? I wasn't the one upset about it. I was talking about [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=841.9200000000001s)]
*  his fellow colleague, this is exactly what I said. His fellow colleague. Do you know what it was? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=847.2800000000001s)]
*  In the US Army, called him out as a potential insider threat. What is the tattoo? You don't want to [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=851.0400000000001s)]
*  answer that. Also, I called him an extremist based upon his own book. Read the book. What is the tattoo? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=856.32s)]
*  If you don't know what the tattoo is, just admit it. Oh my lord. Listen. What is it? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=863.36s)]
*  I'm genuinely intrigued. Do you know what it is or not? Go ahead. We've got a panelist. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=870.0s)]
*  She hasn't spoken yet. A woman hasn't spoken yet. She's going to answer the question you're not [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=874.6400000000001s)]
*  answering. Final question to you, Vagayat. I did answer it. But go ahead. I got my colleague right here. Be honest. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=879.2s)]
*  Do you actually know what that tattoo is or not? Listen, what I do know is I read his book. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=884.96s)]
*  In his book, if you read it, called American Crusade. In his book, wait a second. Be honest. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=890.48s)]
*  I am, look, you guys are putting lipstick on a pig and literally bending the knee for Donald Trump. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=897.12s)]
*  But do you know the answer? Hitting our national security at risk for Pete Hexen. I am telling you [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=903.04s)]
*  everything and you guys are finding ways to spend. Why are you guys okay with a man who has an NDA [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=907.84s)]
*  with a woman that he allegedly sexually assaulted? Do you know what the tattoo is? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=913.12s)]
*  It was his colleague. His colleague called him out as an insider threat. Not me. His colleague. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=918.08s)]
*  And I also said go to his book. Read his words. Just to be clear, Vagayat. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=923.2s)]
*  Where he says I am too extreme for the US military. Pete Hexen's own words. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=927.04s)]
*  Vagayat. Stop talking for a moment. Vagayat. You don't know, do you? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=931.12s)]
*  Why are you guys okay with that? Where literally in his book, American Crusade, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=934.08s)]
*  he says he's too extreme for the US military. Vagayat. You don't know, do you? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=938.16s)]
*  Oh my gosh. All right. Let's look it up right now. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=941.12s)]
*  I'd also love to know the names of some of my Fox colleagues. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=944.4s)]
*  Don't look it up. Let's go back to Michael. Michael. Hang on. Michael. We gave him his [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=946.48s)]
*  chance. He obviously has no idea. Michael, what is the answer? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=951.2s)]
*  This falls along a threat as an insider threat. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  No, no. I'm going back to Michael. No, you haven't talked about it. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=957.12s)]
*  The 2021 Pete Hexen as a potential insider threat and Beoswald tattoo. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=958.8s)]
*  Vagayat, you had 98 chances to answer and you failed the test. Sorry. I'm going to Michael. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=961.36s)]
*  Beoswald tattoo. I don't understand. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=965.6s)]
*  Don't talk over each other. Michael. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=967.2s)]
*  The tattoo in question is called a Jerusalem cross. This is a medieval Christian symbol, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=969.44s)]
*  goes back a long time. In fact, at Jimmy Carter's funeral, there was a Jerusalem cross on the floor [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=976.6400000000001s)]
*  of the cathedral and on the program for the funeral. There's one other tattoo that some [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=980.72s)]
*  have suggested could be extremist. It's the phrase Deus volt, which is a medieval Christian [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=984.72s)]
*  slogan, a long traditional slogan that refers to God's will and it goes back a long way. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=990.72s)]
*  These are very traditional, very mainstream Christian symbols that not only are not extreme [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=996.08s)]
*  in any way, but which even the people who want to accuse him of extremism couldn't possibly name. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1002.08s)]
*  That is pathetic. All right. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1007.76s)]
*  His insider guardsman did it, which is what I said. And also I said that he called himself [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1010.5600000000001s)]
*  too extreme for the US military in his book. That's pathetic. Is Pete Hexen lying that he's [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1014.72s)]
*  too extreme in his book? Let me go to Julie. He's been waiting. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1020.08s)]
*  He's too extreme for radical leftists. Let me go to Julie. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1022.72s)]
*  He said it. Is he lying? Be gentlemanly, please. We have a lady who's not spoken. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1026.08s)]
*  Julie, be very patiently. Your view of this? I'll tell you what, before you answer. I know [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1030.0s)]
*  you said in your sub stack about this. Under normal circumstances, he, Pete Hexen, would be [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1036.6399999999999s)]
*  precluded from serving in any leadership role. So explain why you said that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1042.0s)]
*  Well, let me, I will explain in one second. Let me go back to something that was said in the very [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1048.8s)]
*  beginning, that he spent more than 10 years at Fox News and that's what qualifies him to be [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1052.24s)]
*  in this position that he wants to be in. I spent more than 10 years at Fox News. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1057.36s)]
*  I don't think I'm qualified to run the DOD whatsoever based on my time at Fox News. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1061.28s)]
*  I said that was one of the things. If you, if you, well, I don't think that's even a remote [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1065.04s)]
*  qualification. That's one. Two. Being able to communicate ideas as the secretary of defense [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1069.84s)]
*  and explain policy is actually a very big part of the job. There are plenty, there are plenty of [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1074.56s)]
*  qualified Republicans out there who can run the DOD who also are good on television. It does not [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1080.24s)]
*  need to be Pete Hexen. Secondly, again, you talked about NDAs. I am bound by an NDA at Fox News. If [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1085.68s)]
*  I were not bound by an NDA and if Fox News wanted to release me from that NDA, I could tell you about [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1092.16s)]
*  my time with Pete Hexen. Unfortunately, that's not possible. But I will say that the reason that [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1096.4s)]
*  there are so many people who anonymously came forward at Fox News is that because they're also [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1101.04s)]
*  bound by confidentiality provisions, which one third of all American workers need to sign on [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1105.44s)]
*  their first day of work and if they were to go public, they could get sued. The reason this [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1109.68s)]
*  accuser is not heard from is because according to the New Yorker, she tried desperately to meet with [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1114.4s)]
*  Joni Ernst on the committee and Joni Ernst turned her down. So the reason that she has not been able [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1120.0800000000002s)]
*  to come out publicly is because she has an NDA and even privately she could not meet with a senator [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1126.72s)]
*  on this committee who's also a rape survivor to share her story because that rape survivor did [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1133.28s)]
*  not want to hear from a woman who was going to put her potentially in a position to vote against [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1138.16s)]
*  Pete Hexen. Pete Hexen has written himself while at Princeton saying that women who are passed out, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1142.5600000000002s)]
*  if you have sex with them while they're unconscious, that's not really rape. Right? Now, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1149.76s)]
*  the American military has a tremendous sexual assault problem, a horrible sexual assault problem. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1154.96s)]
*  I have spoken to women in the military who say on deployment, it's not a question of if, but a [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1162.3200000000002s)]
*  question of when they will be sexually assaulted. You cannot possibly have somebody running our [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1167.44s)]
*  military who has said that women who are unconscious deserve to be raped because it's not really rape. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1173.8400000000001s)]
*  You can just go have your way with them. So I don't know which soldiers you've been talking to who [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1179.44s)]
*  think Pete Hexen is a great thing for the military. There's not one woman out there [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1184.0800000000002s)]
*  who cares about being assaulted on deployment, who thinks that this is the person that needs to be [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1190.24s)]
*  in charge of the United States military. And as for the cross that you talked about, yes, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1195.2s)]
*  Deus Vult, which is the cross that he has and the slogan that he has, is an old Christian cross. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1198.88s)]
*  The phrase, excuse me, the phrase. The phrase, however, was uttered by crusaders as they were [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1204.24s)]
*  slaughtering Jews and Muslims during the Second Crusade specifically. So it's not just a random [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1210.72s)]
*  cross. It's not just a random phrase. That is not true. The phrase was uttered after the Council of [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1216.72s)]
*  Claremont when Pope Urban II declared the crusade. It was actually probably Dieu le Vule, but it's [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1224.64s)]
*  been rendered in Latin as Deus Vult. It has nothing to do with slaughtering Muslims because the [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1230.0s)]
*  Muslims had invaded Europe, not the other way around. Oh my God. Are you really saying that [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1236.0800000000002s)]
*  the reason the crusade, which was sent to the Holy Land to liberate the Holy Land, from whom? From [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1242.72s)]
*  Jews and Muslims. The crusade began because the Eastern Emperor asked for help. I'll tell you why [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1247.5200000000002s)]
*  the crusade began because the Eastern Emperor asked for help from the Western Pope because the [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1252.72s)]
*  Seljuk Turks were slaughtering Christians in the Holy Land because those lands were Christian before [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1257.76s)]
*  the Muslims invaded in the 7th century. So that's why. No, no, no. Those lands became Christian [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1261.92s)]
*  after the First Crusade, okay? So let's be very clear. The lands were Christian in the first and [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1273.3600000000001s)]
*  second centuries and then the Muslims. Islam didn't exist before the 7th century. What are you [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1277.52s)]
*  talking about? Okay, listen, listen. I can go all day if you want to talk about the crusades, but the [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1282.56s)]
*  point is, I can't say it was quite fascinating actually. What that has to do with Pete Hexeth is [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1288.56s)]
*  it's not that he has a random cross that talks about his faith in Jesus Christ. He used a very [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1297.84s)]
*  specific terminology, but putting all of that aside. A phrase that was first uttered to defend [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1302.8s)]
*  persecuted Christians in the Middle East just like they're being persecuted today. Okay, if you want [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1306.56s)]
*  to talk about the crusades being- And that's who you want as the Secretary of Defense. Wonderful. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1312.08s)]
*  Yes, someone who defends the Crusades. If you want to talk about the crusades- [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1315.36s)]
*  Judy, finish your point and I'll go to Michael, to David. My point is that I cannot even believe [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  that something the Vatican apologized for is something you're defending, which is the slaughter [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1325.28s)]
*  of Jews and Muslims during the crusades. What did the Vatican apologize for? What are you talking [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1329.04s)]
*  about? Oh my Jesus. You know what? Why don't you give me a call after this and I will walk you [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1333.84s)]
*  through exactly what the Vatican apologized for when it came to the treatment of Muslims. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1337.92s)]
*  Time out. Time out. We'll do a separate crusade debate another time. Let me bring Dave Rubin in. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1342.24s)]
*  Dave, the issue of DEI came up quite a lot in Pete Hexeth's day yesterday, and there's certainly [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1348.0s)]
*  been a growing sense of DEI invading almost every aspect of American life, society, culture, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1354.24s)]
*  and so on, including the military. I thought you landed some pretty effective points on that as [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1360.88s)]
*  well. And coming at a time when you see people like Martin Zuckerberg who were leading the kind [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1365.1200000000001s)]
*  of charge of DEI and liberal woke policy, now doing me screeching U-turns, recognizing that actually [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1370.32s)]
*  it wasn't right. It wasn't fair. It wasn't equitable. It effectively has collectively [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1378.24s)]
*  encouraged mediocrity over meritocracy and so on. And I thought he was effective on that, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1384.32s)]
*  Pete Hexeth. Oh, I thought he was quite effective because he is a TV presenter and knows how to [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1388.6399999999999s)]
*  communicate ideas effectively. He has been well versed in interviewing people and discussing this [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1394.32s)]
*  and talking to people inside the military and inside of all of our institutions and corporations [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1399.6799999999998s)]
*  that have been wrecked and ransacked by DEI. The idea of America is based on individual rights. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1404.08s)]
*  We do not care about your sexuality or your gender or your skin color or any of those other [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1410.3999999999999s)]
*  immutable traits. What we care about is especially in the military, which we all, regardless, I think [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1415.6799999999998s)]
*  of political allegiance, would like to be effective and be able to protect Americans and American [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1421.6s)]
*  interests. We want people who are competent, who are physically fit and mentally fit to do these [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1427.84s)]
*  jobs. We can all, I mean, there's a million examples I can give you here, Piers, but we only need to [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1434.32s)]
*  look at what's going on with the California fires right now and the amount of time that the fire [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1438.48s)]
*  department and the administration and Gavin Newsom and the mayor and LA and California as a whole [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1443.36s)]
*  spent on diversity in the fire department rather than figuring out ways to go about combating fire [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1448.72s)]
*  properly and preventing these things. And that's the exact same thing that the military is going [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1455.12s)]
*  through. It's, by the way, exactly what Mark Zuckerberg was going through at Facebook where [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1459.12s)]
*  he was dealing with an insurrection of his own employees who were woke and trying to silence [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1464.0s)]
*  everybody and the rest of it. So all of these things are deeply connected. And I would say, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1469.36s)]
*  if we're going to save America, which I think we're five days away from turning around a lot of this [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1474.56s)]
*  nonsense, these hearings are a great example of seeing how these, the ideas of equity are [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1479.36s)]
*  actually completely antithetical to everything that this country was founded upon. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1486.8s)]
*  Yeah, but I actually want to segue to something else, which is the breaking news. As we started [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1491.4399999999998s)]
*  this, Donald Trump has gone on his true social platform. We have a deal for hostages in the [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1499.9199999999998s)]
*  Middle East. They will be released shortly. Thank you. The BBC also reporting a deal between Israel [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1505.04s)]
*  and Hamas has been agreed. It's a complex deal. It involves the release of 30-odd hostages over [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1510.56s)]
*  a period of six, seven weeks and many more Palestinians being released from jail and [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1517.92s)]
*  various other security guarantees and ceasefires and so on. All multi-layered complex has to be [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1524.0s)]
*  seen whether, A, this is official, which it looks like it may be in the next day or two. And secondly, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1530.96s)]
*  if it's workable and if it actually gets carried out. But what is your gut reaction to the [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1536.8s)]
*  overall deal that is apparently in play here? You know, I've been on your show for the past [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1542.8s)]
*  15 months, Pierce, and you and I have talked about what's been happening. I think initially [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1548.64s)]
*  October, you know, you and I agreed that Hamas did was a terrorism attack. It was atrocious. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1553.52s)]
*  Israel had a right to respond, but you and I have also seen the devastation of the past 15 months. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1558.4s)]
*  The Lancet just came out with this journey with this peer reviewed study that said actually the [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1562.96s)]
*  casualties might be 40% more appears. So right now we know that 45,000 Palestinians have been killed. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1567.44s)]
*  That could be up to 65,000, 70,000. We know Israel has bombed churches. I know Michael cares a lot [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1572.72s)]
*  about churches right now, but I'm curious to see if he's okay with Israel bombing churches, mosques. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1579.2800000000002s)]
*  It has killed UN workers. It has killed journalists. It has not allowed journalists [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1583.84s)]
*  inside to look at the damage. It has actually killed refugees. It has bombed refugee camps. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1588.56s)]
*  It has bombed UN workers. More children have been killed in the past two years in Gaza than all the [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1593.52s)]
*  war zones combined in the past two years. Right now we know that the majority of the people that [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1598.4s)]
*  have been killed have been women, children, and the elderly civilians. So in this particular case, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1603.6s)]
*  we've heard this before in the summer, right? There was a deal. What's the best deal? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1608.48s)]
*  Ceasefire hostages. There are about a hundred Israeli hostages who are still captured by Hamas. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1612.96s)]
*  I talked to a father of an Israeli hostage, Yehuda Cohen, who blames Netanyahu for the current [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1617.68s)]
*  situation. He says that Netanyahu has to blame for being belligerent, for advancing this war, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1623.6000000000001s)]
*  for rejecting the ceasefire deal when it was in place right in the summer. It was President Biden. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1627.92s)]
*  Remember that Pierce I was on your show. President Biden came out and said, hey, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1632.8000000000002s)]
*  this is Israel's deal. Let's do it. And they keep slow walking it because they have an expansionist [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1636.08s)]
*  view. They want everything from the river to the sea. I hope this time, Pierce, and I said this [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1641.12s)]
*  before on your show, whether it's Trump who does it, whether it's Biden who does it, the war has [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1645.04s)]
*  to end. Ceasefire deal for the hostages. Bring the hostages home. Do a ceasefire deal. End this [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1650.3999999999999s)]
*  bombing. End this pain. End the suffering. A genocide according to Amnesty International. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1657.36s)]
*  A genocide according to Human Rights Watch. A genocide according to Israeli scholars of genocide [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1661.9199999999998s)]
*  who've been saying it for a while. This particular situation where both Hamas leaders and Netanyahu [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1668.08s)]
*  are war criminals according to the ICC. End this once and for all. If it happens, then maybe, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1673.28s)]
*  just maybe, there could be some peace. You need rebuilding humanitarian aid in Gaza. You need the [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1678.56s)]
*  Gazans who've been displaced to come back to the North. You need the hostages to be released. So if [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1682.9599999999998s)]
*  it can happen, Pierce, I don't care if it's Trump who does it. I don't care if it's in the last week [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1688.08s)]
*  of Biden. It has to be done. OK. Michael, it seems to me that all the heavy lifting has been done in [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1691.84s)]
*  the last few days by Trump and his Middle East envoy and that that's really speeded things up. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1697.36s)]
*  I think Trump's saying, if this isn't resolved by my inauguration, there's going to be hell. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1702.0s)]
*  And I suspect Hamas have taken him at his word. We never quite explained what that hell would [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1706.0s)]
*  entail. But they clearly, I think, have been racing to try and do a deal that they will maybe [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1711.4399999999998s)]
*  procrastinating over. Your response to Mujahid, what do you feel about this deal? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1716.24s)]
*  Well, I think every person of goodwill agrees with Wajihat on the narrow point that we want to see [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1720.96s)]
*  an end to the war. Probably not with some of his claims about the war, but we want to see an end [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1728.48s)]
*  to the war. That includes Jews. That includes Muslims. That includes Christians, as Wajihat [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1731.92s)]
*  mentioned. Ancient churches, churches that have existed in the Holy Land long before Islam ever [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1736.24s)]
*  existed have been... We lost Michael. Let's bring in Dave as his running mate. Dave, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1741.28s)]
*  we'll bring you in here because we lost Michael Nolza. God probably intervened on that one. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1748.08s)]
*  Michael is a good expert on the crusades, but I think I can handle the rest of it. Look, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1753.44s)]
*  everyone wants an end to the war and the war could have been over on October 8th. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1756.3999999999999s)]
*  All they had to do was release all of the hostages and no one would have been supporting any sort of [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1759.76s)]
*  military action. That's obvious and real and we all know it. Hamas has intentionally placed [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1765.36s)]
*  civilians in the way. We all know that as well. There is no genocide. I would love to hear [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1772.24s)]
*  any panelists call for Egypt to open up the border and let all the Gazans in, but no Arab country, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1777.76s)]
*  no Muslim country wants any of the Palestinians. There never was a Palestinian state and if there [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1783.36s)]
*  was, tell me who the prime minister was. This is just an endless assault on Israel. There's not [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1789.04s)]
*  going to be peace in any real way. There's no such thing as the two-state solution. There never were [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1796.8s)]
*  two states. Palestine used to be the place that the Jews lived. A lot of Jews just celebrated Hanukkah. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1800.6399999999999s)]
*  You know where Hanukkah took place? The Judean Hills, which we now unfortunately call the West [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1806.24s)]
*  Bank, but that's because the Jews lived there. This is largely... We can get into the, okay, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1811.12s)]
*  give away 30 hostages or they're going to get one hostage back for 30 Palestinians who have [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1819.68s)]
*  blood on their hands or anything else. That tells you right there who actually values life here. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1824.56s)]
*  So I'm not... Look, it'll be nice to get back some people and hopefully Americans. As an American, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1828.72s)]
*  I do hope that the five or six Americans who have been held will return, but I'm not bullish on [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1832.96s)]
*  peace or anything else at the moment. Julie, what do you feel about this? I mean, it's obviously [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1839.92s)]
*  an extraordinarily complex situation. I don't think there'll be any clean way out of this for [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1846.1599999999999s)]
*  many years, but do you feel that this deal which they're talking about is at least a step in the [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1851.4399999999998s)]
*  right direction? Yeah, you're absolutely right that it's too complex to lend itself to short [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1857.84s)]
*  soundbites. It's a deal, right? And it's a deal. I'm happy for the families whose loved ones are [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1866.08s)]
*  being released, but I think Dave did touch on something. I don't agree with a lot of what he [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1871.68s)]
*  said, but he did touch on something, which is I don't know what the end solution to this is, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1875.8400000000001s)]
*  because you had Ariel Sharon give Gaza, effectively give the land that Gaza's... The [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1880.72s)]
*  Gazan land right now to the Palestinians, and in an election, they elected Hamas after a short [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1886.3200000000002s)]
*  period of time. And so what do you do if you're Israeli when you have that kind of threat on your [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1891.76s)]
*  border? It's not to excuse what the Israelis are doing in the West Bank right now. It's [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1897.76s)]
*  absolutely atrocious, and I say that as somebody who has a lot of family in Israel, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1902.8799999999999s)]
*  and I don't support it. I'm fully for the two-state solution, but it has to be two states where one of [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1905.84s)]
*  those states is not run by a terrorist organization like Hamas. No, it doesn't have to be a two-state [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1910.56s)]
*  solution. There's no reason for anyone to think there should be a two-state solution. They can [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1915.2s)]
*  go to Jordan. They can go to Egypt. Gaza was part of Egypt. Remember? West Bank was part of Jordan. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1919.44s)]
*  Judea and Samaria was part of Jordan. Why would they have to go to Jordan and Egypt when they've [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1924.96s)]
*  been living on this land for generations? I mean, the reality is... Well, if they're being [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1930.96s)]
*  genocided and all of the other things that the other panelists said right there, they might want [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1934.72s)]
*  to look into that. You might want to if any of that is true. Or how about... There's one place [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1938.64s)]
*  in the Middle East where Jews and Christians and Muslims live peacefully. It's Israel, ironically. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1945.28s)]
*  Piers, I have a solution. Listen, have you been to Israel recently? Let me just say this. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1951.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I was there twice in the last year. Let's be very clear. Okay. So let's be very clear. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1955.9199999999998s)]
*  There are places in Israel where they live peacefully, and there are places in Israel [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1961.12s)]
*  where settlers are not allowing Muslims to live peacefully. So let's not put this all on just [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1965.76s)]
*  the Muslim population of what is Israel and the West Bank. Where are the Muslims allowing the [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1971.12s)]
*  Jews to live peacefully? I walked around in Jerusalem where you can walk around with Orthodox [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1976.56s)]
*  Jews walking next to women in burkas. Where are the Muslims allowing the Jews or the Christians [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1981.04s)]
*  to live peacefully? Ask the Coptic Christians of Egypt. How many Jews are left in Morocco? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1986.08s)]
*  Any Jews in Jordan these days? We could go through all the countries? Listen, I'm not disagreeing [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1991.28s)]
*  with you on how the Muslim countries have treated Jews. You're absolutely right. I will answer your [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=1997.36s)]
*  question. You're right. There's two million Muslims in Israel. They live with equal rights. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2002.0s)]
*  So you're not allowed to answer the question. May I as a resident Muslim? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2008.16s)]
*  The job has a solution. Sure, sure. The job has a solution. Go on. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2011.44s)]
*  No, go ahead. But you wanted to finish your point. Please go ahead. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2016.4s)]
*  Well, my only point that I want to finish is, look, there's no question that in the West Bank, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2020.32s)]
*  which I would hope would one day lead to an independent, safe Palestinian state that wants [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2024.88s)]
*  to live in peace with its Israeli neighbors, that there are settlers there who are not necessarily [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2030.0s)]
*  allowing Muslims to live in peace at the moment. Okay. I'm not suggesting that Gaza is a whole [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2034.96s)]
*  different story, but you can't put this just on the Palestinians. There are elements within Israeli [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2040.48s)]
*  society that are also prone to violence. And you can't say that there aren't. It's not a black or [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2046.88s)]
*  white issue. It's a deeply complex issue. The Israelis have offered peace deals about a half [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2052.56s)]
*  dozen times over 20, 30 plus years. You're absolutely right. The Palestinians have rejected [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2055.44s)]
*  every single peace deal. You're absolutely right. Here I go. Here's my solution. You're [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2060.32s)]
*  absolutely right. And nobody has screwed the Palestinians more than their leadership. You're [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2064.64s)]
*  absolutely right on that. I think we can probably agree with that. No Israeli government has actually [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2068.08s)]
*  ever tried. Israeli governments, whether they're labor or Likud, have never tried ending the [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2072.88s)]
*  occupation in the West Bank, in East Jerusalem, and in Gaza. What they haven't done is end the [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2077.6s)]
*  settlements. The settlements have actually expanded in the West Bank. Right now in the West Bank, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2082.4s)]
*  Hamas is not under control. There's two and a half million Palestinians who live under military law. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2087.92s)]
*  There's about 750,000 Israelis who live under Israeli law. An unequal system. You've been there, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2093.36s)]
*  Pierce. I've been there. It's horrifying. This is why Desmond Tutu and Jimmy Carter, rest in peace, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2099.52s)]
*  called it what? Apartheid. Their words, not mine. I've been there. I've seen it. We are complicit [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2104.08s)]
*  in it. Hamas is not in control. There's no excuse. We have Ben Gavir, the national security [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2109.92s)]
*  minister, a man who Israeli reporters told me is like, imagine if the KKK was elected as a national [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2114.16s)]
*  security minister. That's the national security minister under Netanyahu. Netanyahu has openly [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2119.76s)]
*  said, I want river to the sea. He laughed and mocked and said, aha, I have blocked the peace [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2124.88s)]
*  deal. I have blocked two state solutions. When President Biden said end settlements, he added [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2130.2400000000002s)]
*  3000 more settlements. When President Biden said don't bomb Ruffa, he bombed Ruffa. Why should Jews not be allowed to live in Judea? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2134.32s)]
*  President Biden said don't kill civilians. He bombed the World Trade Central kitchen staff. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2138.72s)]
*  Remember that? It is a chaos to the point where everyone in the world, except in the U.S. and [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2143.52s)]
*  except in Israel, they see Israel as becoming a pariah, increasingly an extremist Jewish supremacist [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2148.24s)]
*  state. If it was up to David, river to the sea, let Israel do what it wants and continue the [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2154.3199999999997s)]
*  occupation. Dave said Palestinians do it because there's no such thing as Palestinians. So David, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2159.52s)]
*  today you have gone on the side against justice and on the side of Pete Hexeth, but since you're so good on TV, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2164.8s)]
*  let me finish. I let you say your hateful stuff. Let me finish. Since you're so good on TV, based on [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2170.96s)]
*  your own logic, you should replace Mike Huckabee as the ambassador to Israel. You're great on TV. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2177.44s)]
*  All right, let me switch to something else. You mentioned President Biden. He's come out with his [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2183.1200000000003s)]
*  farewell letter, Dave, President Biden. I mean, I've read some deluded claptrap in my time, but [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2187.52s)]
*  Biden's self-appraisal of basically how he saved America and the world is pretty priceless. And I [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2193.68s)]
*  watched his stuff he said on television the other night as well. The guy seems to be tripping towards [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2200.64s)]
*  retirement in an utterly deluded manner about his presidency, doesn't he? Dave, that's for you. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2207.36s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't hear who the question was for. Well, look, this is the [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2217.2799999999997s)]
*  obvious end to an utterly embarrassing pandering and I would say, frankly, almost illegal presidency. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2221.2799999999997s)]
*  The man has been cognitively impaired. We all knew it or most of us knew it. I was doing videos on [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2229.12s)]
*  this back in 2019. The idea that he's been in charge of this administration is a complete sham. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2234.48s)]
*  He can't speak off the cuff, obviously. He can barely read off the prompter. We're just watching [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2240.3999999999996s)]
*  the end of something that, look, they cooed him over the summer. He wanted to run. We know [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2246.48s)]
*  Jill wanted him to run. Kamala Harris and Barack Obama and whatever party leaders, they threatened [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2252.56s)]
*  him with the 25th Amendment. This entire thing has been one sham after the other. And I think [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2257.76s)]
*  after we have five more days of this, we're going to probably see Joe Biden about three more times [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2263.2s)]
*  and then there will suddenly be a letter released and it will say that he has been dealing with [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2267.84s)]
*  these cognitive issues. They knew it, blah, blah, blah. And then it will leak out. Over the course [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2272.96s)]
*  of the next year, there will be plenty more to leak out, but he has not been in charge. It is [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2277.92s)]
*  a miracle we got through these four years and we're going to have to deal with a lot of the fallout [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2281.76s)]
*  that he put in. But I'm very bullish, obviously, on Trump and this administration and the people [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2286.16s)]
*  he's bringing in, including Pete Hegseth. And I think we're going to see a lot of positive [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2290.32s)]
*  change very quickly and it couldn't come too soon. Yeah. I mean, Julie, I've heard Democrats trying [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2294.2400000000002s)]
*  to defend Joe Biden. They're sort of running out of energy for it. I think everyone kind of knows [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2299.28s)]
*  now this is an old guy probably suffering from a form of dementia who's just stammering and [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2306.0s)]
*  stuttering and falling his way through to the end of what has turned out to be a pretty poor [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2312.1600000000003s)]
*  presidency, isn't it? Have you listened to Donald Trump? I mean, I'm listening to this and I'm kind [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2318.0800000000004s)]
*  of in shock. Have you listened to what comes out of Donald Trump's mouth, who, by the way, is an [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2325.2s)]
*  insurrectionist? Well, I listen to Donald Trump and all I see is a guy. I see, well, it's interesting [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2329.12s)]
*  you mentioned Trump. So I see a guy in Trump who's two years younger than Biden, but looks about 20 [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2334.24s)]
*  years younger than Biden and still has... Well, I'm sure if you got... He does. Yeah, Biden makes the [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2339.9199999999996s)]
*  mistake of not getting airbrushed every day. But look, here's the bottom line. Joe Biden is leaving [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2346.0s)]
*  Donald Trump a very strong economy. Donald Trump promised, he promised to bring down, and I quote, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2351.28s)]
*  the price of bacon, the price of eggs, and the price of apples. I can't wait to watch those [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2358.32s)]
*  promises. And on January 20th, that clock starts. Those are commitments that he made, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2364.0800000000004s)]
*  and he's going to have to live up to them. He's going to have to live up to the fact that he is [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2369.2000000000003s)]
*  going to explode the American economy even more, even more than his gangbusters right now. And you [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2373.44s)]
*  have to admit the American economy is doing better than any other Western country at the moment. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2379.28s)]
*  He's going to have to come through on his promises to deport people. Wait a second, deport people. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2383.0400000000004s)]
*  Wait, stop, stop, stop. Mass deportation, tariffs on everybody, and keep the economy going, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2388.32s)]
*  and bring down the price of goods. I can't wait to see him pull that rat... Listen, I'll be the [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2396.48s)]
*  first to say when he does that, I'll be the first to compliment him. But right now I'm going to sit [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2400.5600000000004s)]
*  back and watch him try to do that. Okay, good. I look forward to it. You're right, it's on Trump. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2404.32s)]
*  Turning now to the LA wildfires, the bill for rebuilding Los Angeles is now estimated to be [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2410.56s)]
*  $250 billion, even if the city braces for yet more devastation today. House Speaker Mike Johnson [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2414.7200000000003s)]
*  suggested that federal aid for California may be conditional on big changes from local government. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2420.48s)]
*  Well, that hasn't gone down well with some, including Woodpeak Goldberg, who says it's unfair [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2425.1200000000003s)]
*  to hold anyone accountable for an historic natural disaster. Having lived in California, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2429.28s)]
*  having lost every house, save for one, that we ever lived in, I take great offense at pointing [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2434.4799999999996s)]
*  fingers. You should be pointing fingers about how can we help? It's too soon to be saying, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2444.7999999999997s)]
*  oh, it's Gavin's fault. It's nobody's fault. It's like us taking seriously that there are [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2450.64s)]
*  you know, magic lasers in the sky that direct the weather. That doesn't work. It doesn't happen. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2456.56s)]
*  It's a catastrophe and this is what's happened. And let's try to figure out how to work towards [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2464.0s)]
*  not having it happen again. But you know, we don't control Mother Nature. Mother Nature doesn't give [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2470.4s)]
*  a damn what we want. Mother Nature does what she does. And if you're in the way, this is what [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2475.68s)]
*  happens. And California is chock full of people. Well, we've got Michael back. Michael, welcome back. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2482.48s)]
*  Sorry we lost you temporarily. Let's start with you, given you've rejoined us. You know, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2488.2400000000002s)]
*  I just couldn't disagree with it more. And also, I have a fundamental belief that if it was a [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2493.12s)]
*  Republican controlled setup in California, she'd be saying the complete opposite. The view regularly [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2497.28s)]
*  rants about Republican failures of accountability. And the truth is, I have a home in LA, which [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2503.92s)]
*  thankfully is still standing and I hope it continues to do so. But I know so many people [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2508.8s)]
*  who've lost their homes who are incandescent with rage about what they perceive to be persistent [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2512.88s)]
*  failures right across the board of the mayor, Karen Bass, who fled the country. Having said she'd [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2518.2400000000002s)]
*  never leave the country, she went to Ghana for an inauguration as these winds were coming in, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2523.6800000000003s)]
*  as fires were breaking out. Unbelievable dereliction of duty. You've got the Justin Trudeau of the [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2529.2000000000003s)]
*  operation in Gavin Newsom, who I think deserves a lot of heat, literally, for what is going on here [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2534.56s)]
*  and a lot of accountability. So this idea that they all should be blameless because, you know, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2542.4s)]
*  nature, I think is for the birds, isn't it? Of course. And Whoopi's argument here that this was [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2547.52s)]
*  unpredictable and inevitable would be more persuasive if you hadn't had many people, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2553.92s)]
*  up to and including President Trump, personally warning Gavin Newsom that this would happen [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2559.52s)]
*  in 2018, 2019, just at the end of last year in 2024. It was not inevitable and an act of nature [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2564.64s)]
*  that 95% of Delta rainwater was sent into the Pacific Ocean rather than filling reservoirs. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2572.64s)]
*  It wasn't an act of nature that the Pacific Palisades reservoir was empty, was turned off [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2578.32s)]
*  before the predictable perennial Santa Ana winds. It was not unpredictable that you'd have 100 [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2583.6s)]
*  mile an hour wings. That happens regularly in LA. It was not nature and inevitable that LA wouldn't [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2588.88s)]
*  have cleared its brush. You know, these were basic political problems. Even people who were not expert [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2594.96s)]
*  in it could have seen this coming a mile away and did. And so the residents of LA, I'm a former [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2600.96s)]
*  Angelino myself, they deserve some answers. And the politicians, Newsom and Karen Bass in particular, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2606.6400000000003s)]
*  need to be held accountable. Of course, Karen Bass, who's turned out to be utterly useless, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2612.7200000000003s)]
*  from her silence when she finally flew back from this jolly to Ghana, which she had no need to be [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2617.52s)]
*  at and she knew these winds were coming in. She says nothing to Sky News and the most paralyzing, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2622.88s)]
*  embarrassing scene I've ever witnessed of a mayor coming back to a disaster. And every public utterance [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2628.7200000000003s)]
*  since has been frankly just utterly pointless and nonsensical and contributes nothing to anyone. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2633.84s)]
*  The idea that she should continue to be considered blameless because of nature, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2640.88s)]
*  when you've got the person she beat, Rick Caruso, who I think lost because he's a rich white billionaire, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2646.0s)]
*  but actually specializes in property and development. You know, it comes down to this for me. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2652.16s)]
*  Who do I trust more to rebuild LA? Is it Karen Bass or is it Rick Caruso? And if it's obviously [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2657.12s)]
*  Rick Caruso, then why is she still mayor? Why isn't she being held accountable right now? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2664.4s)]
*  Why aren't they kicking her out and getting someone in who understands reconstruction, for example? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2670.08s)]
*  Who are you planning on having her kick out? I mean, she's, listen, there's going to be an election [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2676.88s)]
*  or there's going to be some sort of recall. If that's the case, then she'll be recalled. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2681.28s)]
*  If people agree or don't agree. But I mean, I think right now people are a little too concerned [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2685.52s)]
*  about saving their lives and saving their houses to worry about recalling Karen Bass at the moment. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2688.88s)]
*  I don't agree. I see that. But Julie, I don't agree with that. I mean, I had Dennis Quaid on yesterday. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2693.92s)]
*  He knows a hundred people who've lost their homes. He wants a recall immediately. He thinks she lives [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2699.76s)]
*  literally disappeared. Fine. Then he should get the signatures, circulate the petitions to get a [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2705.76s)]
*  recall. That's not a problem. I mean, listen, the beauty of living in this country is there are [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2711.52s)]
*  mechanisms with which to do that if you so choose. I would say to you, however, the larger issue here [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2715.6000000000004s)]
*  is that California is not the only state that deals with natural disasters and Republicans will [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2721.76s)]
*  not be in charge forever. What goes around comes around. And I would be very, very wary [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2727.36s)]
*  of throwing out these kinds of contingencies because one day Donald Trump will not be president. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2733.52s)]
*  One day Mike Johnson will not be speaker. One day there will be Democrats sitting in both those [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2737.92s)]
*  offices. And one day Louisiana, Mike Johnson's home state or Florida, Donald Trump's home state, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2742.6400000000003s)]
*  probably sooner rather than later is going to have a horrible natural disaster. And on that day- [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2748.08s)]
*  It's already happening. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2754.2400000000002s)]
*  When that happens. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2754.96s)]
*  But we have them and we have competent governments. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2755.52s)]
*  Of course. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2757.84s)]
*  Have you met Ron DeSantis? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2758.08s)]
*  Plenty, plenty, plenty of Democrats. This happens all the time. Listen, I'm from New York [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2760.0s)]
*  and I recall very clearly when Ted Cruz would not vote for Hurricane Sandy relief. And then a few [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2764.5600000000004s)]
*  years later, all of a sudden this horrible situation in Texas happened and he came crawling [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2768.8s)]
*  hat in hand to New York senators and to New York members of Congress, begging them for money for [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2773.52s)]
*  Texas. So if you want to go down this road, feel free. If you want to take advantage of people's [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2778.2400000000002s)]
*  natural disasters, feel free. But the reality is when that happens to you- [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2783.0400000000004s)]
*  Can I say something? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2786.88s)]
*  Expect that what goes around comes around. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2787.84s)]
*  But Jaha? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2789.76s)]
*  Yeah, real quick. California is my home state. It is the fifth largest economy in the world, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2791.1200000000003s)]
*  the most populous state in the country, 40 million people currently suffering from one [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2794.6400000000003s)]
*  of the most devastating fires over a hundred thousand people have been displaced. You know [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2799.6000000000004s)]
*  what's free? Compassion. You know what's free? Decency. You know what's free? Empathy. The [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2802.8s)]
*  United States of America can afford that. The president of the United States of America, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2807.52s)]
*  Donald Trump, at the very least he can do that. Don't be cruel. Don't promote misinformation. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2810.8s)]
*  Don't promote an AI-generated image of Los Angeles on fire and replacing Hollywood Trump [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2816.24s)]
*  was right. You know what you can also agree on is climate change, which is here, which will exist [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2822.0s)]
*  after Republicans and Democrats. And if I take the logic of Michael and Dave and cruel MAGA folks, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2826.4799999999996s)]
*  then Ted Cruz should not have gone to Cancun while his state was freezing. These dumbass Republicans [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2832.3199999999997s)]
*  in Texas- [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2838.72s)]
*  He shouldn't have done. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2839.2799999999997s)]
*  This is for everyone watching around the world. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2839.8399999999997s)]
*  He shouldn't have done. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2840.72s)]
*  For the sake of politics, not for the sake of money, not for the sake of national security, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2841.12s)]
*  they are off the national grid. They have their own grid. So if they want to actually resign, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2845.2s)]
*  if you want leaders to resign, Texas Republicans should resign for literally helping their own [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2850.0s)]
*  consumers. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2855.6s)]
*  All right. Okay. All right. Commendable, what about, sorry. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2856.08s)]
*  Climate change. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2859.2799999999997s)]
*  Wait, wait. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2859.9199999999996s)]
*  Commendable, what about? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2860.56s)]
*  Climate change. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2861.52s)]
*  In fact, climate change actually bears very little contribution to this. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2862.08s)]
*  No, a study came out just today. Climate change could be blamed for- [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2866.3999999999996s)]
*  I have studied it probably more than you've studied it, I can guarantee you. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2869.3599999999997s)]
*  And actually the reality is- [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2873.2s)]
*  Pierce, just today, UCLA scientists came out and said that climate change could be blamed for- [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2874.16s)]
*  Also, historically, Los Angeles- [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2878.56s)]
*  25% of the fuel available for the fires, but the fires would have happened regardless, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2880.0s)]
*  but climate change made it worse. Just like the cataf- [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2884.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I keep talking. You haven't even said that. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2887.52s)]
*  Yeah, the truth. I mean, I'll come to Dave. I mean, the truth, Dave, about California and LA [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2889.92s)]
*  in particular, is that for 100 years or so, it's had very hot winters, very wet winters. This thing, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2893.7599999999998s)]
*  this cyclical thing builds up against Santa Ana, come and go. There's nothing particularly [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2900.8s)]
*  different about this other than freakishly, they had two very wet winters followed by a very, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2904.88s)]
*  very dry one this time, which meant there was a lot more vegetation out there to then get very, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2910.7200000000003s)]
*  very dry. And that has meant the whole thing has become a bit of a tinderbox, which by the way, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2917.28s)]
*  should have been spotted and dealt with in a much better way, in my opinion, by the politicians. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2922.48s)]
*  And it wasn't. So, Dave- [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2928.1600000000003s)]
*  And Michael, Michael made the point that Donald Trump warned Gavin Newsom about this years ago. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2929.52s)]
*  There is plenty of video of them standing at a party talking about it. I would also mention [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2934.3199999999997s)]
*  that the personal insults of the other panelists aside for a moment. If you actually believe in [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2938.16s)]
*  climate change, if you believe in climate change, it's the Democrats that have been president for [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2943.68s)]
*  the last four years. It's the Democrats that have the governorship of California. It's the Democrats [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2949.04s)]
*  that have the mayorship of Los Angeles. It's the Democrats that have a super majority in the [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2953.44s)]
*  legislature in California. So if you believe in climate change, I do not, but if you do, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2957.68s)]
*  what did Gavin Newsom do to prevent this? He did absolutely nothing. And it's not only that he did [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2962.8799999999997s)]
*  nothing, but then he gets up there and he lies to everyone and takes no culpability. I'm sure you [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2968.72s)]
*  all saw the video of that woman coming up to him saying, we need help, we need help. And he says, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2974.96s)]
*  I'm on the phone with the president of the United States right now, literally. He says, literally. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2979.04s)]
*  And then a moment later, he says, oh, I have no cell service. The man's inclination is to lie. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2984.16s)]
*  Well, funny enough, funny enough, Dave. He should have gone to camp late. I don't want to interrupt, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2989.2s)]
*  Chas. But Dave, you've teed this up perfectly because you're a professional, even though you [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2994.16s)]
*  didn't know about this. I'm going to let you guys go because I know, Julie, you've got a hard out, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=2998.48s)]
*  but also because I actually do have the LA resident, Rachel Darvish, waiting, who was the [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3002.8799999999997s)]
*  woman involved in that interaction with Gavin Newsom. So those of you who didn't see it, let's [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3008.3199999999997s)]
*  take a look at the original incident. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3012.56s)]
*  Let's get it. Let's get it. I want to be here when you call the president. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3042.56s)]
*  So the question is, has the governor lived up to his word? Joining me now is Rachel herself. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3046.7999999999997s)]
*  Rachel, great to have you on Uncensored. I watched that with mounting anger, actually, on your behalf [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3050.56s)]
*  because you were just getting so obviously fobbed off by Gavin Newsom and your anger was palpable [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3057.2s)]
*  and entirely justified. How do you feel now, now that everyone's seen this video, how do you feel [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3063.44s)]
*  about it? I'm an American, Piers. Thanks for having me on. Am I allowed to use the word that [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3068.96s)]
*  starts with W on your show? Absolutely. She's a wanker. That's all I can say. It was insanity. It [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3075.44s)]
*  was pure insanity. It's still insanity. I was standing in front of my daughter's preschool, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3084.88s)]
*  for God's sake, Methodist preschool, looking at the rubble of her school, looking at the rubble [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3089.6s)]
*  of school where all those kids, I was up on a mountain coming down the hill when the fire [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3095.92s)]
*  started. I was one of the first people to know about this fire. I got to tell you what, we were [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3102.88s)]
*  the second home in at the top of the hill. It took me five hours to get down the hill, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3107.28s)]
*  not a single fire truck, not a single bit of assistance, no warning, no nothing. And then [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3111.84s)]
*  to come down the hill, ask somebody else to watch my daughter and then know that that person's house [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3116.56s)]
*  burned down. And in a matter of moments, to see that I'm standing in front of the man who's been [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3122.32s)]
*  in charge of my state since 2011 in some way, shape and form, boy, there's so much that goes [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3129.04s)]
*  on inside of you. And I just had to ask him. And then to be lied to so bald-faced, I'm looking at [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3135.84s)]
*  his phone. He actually offered his phone to me, Piers. And was he on the phone to President Biden, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3141.44s)]
*  do you think? Or was that, did he make that up? Was he on the phone with President Biden? The [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3147.52s)]
*  cameras were running, obviously. I caught him from the time I was in my vehicle with the Sky TV, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3152.88s)]
*  and I rushed over to him. I didn't do anything to change his particular circumstances. He was not [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3158.4s)]
*  on the phone with the president. The very first call on his call log was to a woman. It was his [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3164.64s)]
*  wife. So what does that tell you about Gavin Newsom? The same thing that everyone's known for years. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3169.12s)]
*  The same thing that everyone's known for years. Look, if you study history, you just don't want [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3176.08s)]
*  to see history repeat itself. 2011, we've had Gavin Newsom in charge of our state. We've had [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3183.2799999999997s)]
*  2011 to 2025 for this guy to be ready for us. And when the time came, boy, was he not ready. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3190.0s)]
*  Man, you know, Piers, the water ran out at 3.30 in the morning. I mean, it's unbelievable. Where [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3197.92s)]
*  did our money go? Where did all our property taxes go? Where did 250 million in your coffers? You [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3205.92s)]
*  couldn't send a fire truck up there. You couldn't keep the hydrants full, man. Come on. The thing [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3213.12s)]
*  is, I sat here listening to your panel, and it actually is exactly what inspired me. I'm listening [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3221.52s)]
*  to each one of those people that spoke. And let me tell you, I heard something great from each one [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3228.08s)]
*  of them. I really did. But I can tell you who's the Democrat, and I can tell you who's the [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3231.84s)]
*  Republican. Wouldn't it be beautiful if we took each and every one of what they said that was so [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3236.56s)]
*  good and so right, and we took that and put someone like that in office? Someone who didn't care, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3241.28s)]
*  Whoopi Goldberg, what are you talking about, Whoopi? We shouldn't be pointing fingers. How are we [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3247.44s)]
*  going to fix this? Those two people are so irrelevant to the solution here that let's just point those [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3251.84s)]
*  two fingers right at them and say bye bye. Do you think that Mayor Bass should be recalled? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3259.12s)]
*  There's no thinking involved in that. There's no thinking involved in that, Pierce. I believe [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3266.96s)]
*  they've already started the petition. The problem is that they should not even be here in the first [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3270.48s)]
*  place, but I can't fix that. So California has a lot to deal with at the moment. And I hope that [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3278.16s)]
*  while we are in the midst of trying to find a place to live, while we're in the midst of trying [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3284.7999999999997s)]
*  to get clean water, while we're getting ourselves out of this war zone that we're in, that we have [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3288.64s)]
*  something going on up here, that we don't let this happen again. And Rachel, what is your personal [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3293.68s)]
*  situation at the moment? I'm going to be homeless for a little while. I'm going to be homeless. I'm [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3300.08s)]
*  fighting with the thousands of displaced people trying to find a place to live that will accommodate [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3306.64s)]
*  my elderly mother and my three-year-old daughter. Was there anything left of your home? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3314.16s)]
*  I can tell you that yesterday and the day before and every day before that I've gotten more and [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3320.16s)]
*  more information. Whether my home is standing or not almost doesn't make any difference. My home [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3324.56s)]
*  is standing, but I can't get there. I believe it's actually part of what could be a crime scene, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3330.64s)]
*  Pierce, as this continues. So every single person in the Palisades is facing a completely [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3336.7999999999997s)]
*  different circumstance in front of them. Some people have a home, some people don't. You have [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3342.96s)]
*  a home, you've got nothing to go home to. And then we face other battles, the insurance battle, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3346.8s)]
*  we are facing the rains that are going to inevitably come. I live right behind a hill. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3352.64s)]
*  I texted the governor's office this morning and last night asking him for assistance for the [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3358.88s)]
*  future. I asked him if he could have the foresight to know that what's next on the horizon are rains. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3365.2s)]
*  And we're going to have mudslides and we're going to be whatever was theirs is going to be destroyed [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3371.44s)]
*  even further if these guys don't pay attention. I haven't heard back from them. A lot of people [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3376.48s)]
*  feel that LA has always been pretty Democrat, but they feel that what's happened here on the Democrat [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3381.28s)]
*  watch will lead to a lot of people flipping and voting Republican in the future. Do you get that [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3387.92s)]
*  sense as well? I got to tell you the first call I got from someone was a really good friend of mine. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3393.36s)]
*  Total lifelong Democrat. And I won't use the words she used. She's a doctor, very professional, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3400.48s)]
*  but very professionally told me that she would not be voting for the Ds ever again. And I actually [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3405.92s)]
*  think that's a fabacy. I think that's a shame because I'm sure there are wonderful Democrats [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3412.64s)]
*  out there who don't fall into the category of a Gavin Newsom or an incompetent Karen Bass. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3416.16s)]
*  So I'm sure that's the reality. Let's not make the Democrat or Republican thing the big issue. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3421.2s)]
*  We just got some really S-H-I-N-Y people in charge right now. Have you heard from Gavin Newsom since [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3426.72s)]
*  your exchange went viral? No, I have not. I have texted and had a few exchanges with somebody in [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3434.24s)]
*  his office. I've gotten copy paste responses. I have asked. I asked on camera. I asked Governor [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3440.9599999999996s)]
*  Newsom if I could be there when he was meeting with the president. I want to be there when he [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3448.24s)]
*  meets with the president elect because I don't trust this man. And look, I'm just a mom from [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3452.88s)]
*  Pacific Palisades. I just wanted to have an in with the man responsible for where my money goes. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3457.84s)]
*  And where did my money go? It went to no fire hydrants, no reservoirs full. It went to [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3467.2000000000003s)]
*  the destruction of a town built by some really, really great people who never wanted to leave. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3475.04s)]
*  Wait until the Olympics comes. What are we going to do? What are we going to do then? Wait till [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3481.52s)]
*  what's coming up? The World Cup, the Olympics. We have the Super Bowl coming to LA. We're in big [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3486.64s)]
*  trouble if we let Whoopi Goldberg or anyone else like that make decisions for us down the line. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3493.52s)]
*  Karen Bass, Gavin Newsom. But how do we get there? How do we get to the point where we don't make [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3498.88s)]
*  these kind of decisions again? That, I think, is something we need to be talking about [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3506.16s)]
*  hardcore with the people of Los Angeles so that we are not in this predicament again. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3511.04s)]
*  Yeah. Finally, Rachel, if he's watching this and he might be, what's your message to Gavin Newsom? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3516.16s)]
*  The same it was the first time I saw you. I've never met you before, Governor. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3522.08s)]
*  Please ask me for help. Please let me come there and help you. I told you I said I would fill up [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3525.68s)]
*  the fire hydrants. You know, I know, I hope you know that that's, that was my way of saying, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3530.32s)]
*  I'd like to help. Please respond to me. How else can I get in touch with you? I have a direct line [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3536.56s)]
*  to your office and you still won't respond to me. Maybe the president-elect will take me up on [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3544.4s)]
*  my offer to have Palisadian mothers be present when their town is being rebuilt. But I am asking [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3550.1600000000003s)]
*  for some way to be part of this problem so that we can make it make a solution that my neighbors, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3555.76s)]
*  my residents, the people I live with don't have to worry whether the fire department is going to [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3561.44s)]
*  come and save our lives when we pay their, we pay their salaries. Yeah. Rachel, you're a very [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3566.5600000000004s)]
*  powerful and eloquent advocate for change in LA. And I really do respect you. I respected you in [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3572.96s)]
*  the way you dealt with Gavin Newsom. I respect you more having interviewed you. Thank you very [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3581.36s)]
*  much for joining me. Thanks for your time, Piers. I appreciate your words. I wish you and everyone [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3585.92s)]
*  there all the very best. I've got a house in LA and up in Beverly Hills. Thankfully that hasn't [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBr_9NpEOVM&t=3591.28s)]
