Video Description: At least 54 Palestinians were killed in two separate Israeli strikes on Sunday night, including on a school that was sheltering displaced families. Meanwhile, last week in Washington a young couple working for the Israeli embassy were shot dead outside a Jewish museum, with the suspected assailant telling officers he “did it for Palestine”.
Such extremism on both sides shows why this war should end, and soon - but how?
Piers Morgan speaks to CEO of FAJR Global* Dr Mosab Nasser, who has lost 74 members of his family to what he says is a genocide in Gaza. Then, Uncensored is joined by two people with very differing views on the warl Professor Norman Finkelstein and Israeli historian Benny Morris.
*CEO of FAJR Global is a humanitarian organization operating in Gaza and around the world sending surgeons and aid to crisis areas.

# "CLEARLY An Ethnic Cleansing!" Norman Finkelstein vs Benny Morris on Gaza
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs)
*  We're left with no choice but to speak up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=0.0s)]
*  Hit injuries, amputations, some are, you know, many are burned to lives. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2.64s)]
*  Show me the gas chambers. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=6.8s)]
*  You spoke about objectivity or something. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=8.0s)]
*  The man is a total Hamas propagandist. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=10.08s)]
*  Fully one half of Israeli Jews believe that Israel should conduct a genocide in Gaza. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=12.96s)]
*  That is a lie. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=18.64s)]
*  I know, Benny, Benny, everybody's lying. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=19.84s)]
*  We are looking at the Holocaust live on 4K screens, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=23.52s)]
*  and our politicians, our human human rights organizations, you'll help us. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=27.84s)]
*  It may not be the death of absolutely everybody, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=33.36s)]
*  but it means killing a lot of Palestinians and kicking the rest out of the area. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=36.24s)]
*  And that is a genocide. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=40.72s)]
*  Genocide is something which is carried out systematically. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=42.32s)]
*  That's not what is happening. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=44.96s)]
*  They may even have a genocidal mentality, but they do not control government policy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=46.32s)]
*  That's done by the generals. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=51.28s)]
*  And unfortunately, in my mind, by a man called Netanyahu, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  who's totally a corrupt and incompetent. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=56.64s)]
*  At least 54 Palestinians were killed in two separate Israeli strikes overnight, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=60.24s)]
*  including on a school which was sheltering displaced families. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=64.16s)]
*  Israel says they were targeted attacks on a Hamas command center. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=67.76s)]
*  But it's now undeniable that the civilian death toll from the latest bombardments [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=71.36s)]
*  and blockade is intolerable. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=75.68s)]
*  The ugly ripples of this increasingly ugly war are still being felt across the whole world. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=78.0s)]
*  A young couple were shot dead outside a Jewish museum in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=82.96s)]
*  both Israeli embassy staffers. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=88.16s)]
*  Suspected gunman Elias Rodriguez told officers, I did it for Palestine. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  There's been a big reaction to what I said last week with many of Israel's backers attacking me [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  with the same venom that pro-Palestinians tend to do. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=99.91999999999999s)]
*  And they don't like what I have to say the other way around. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=102.72s)]
*  So let me just be clear again. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=104.8s)]
*  I don't pick sides. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  I try to follow the facts and call out extremism on both sides. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=108.16s)]
*  When facts change, so do my opinions. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=113.52s)]
*  And if your opinions don't change with facts change, then maybe you're the problem, not me. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=116.48s)]
*  What is clear to me is that what started as a justified war, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Israel's right to defend itself against a horrific terrorist attack, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=127.6s)]
*  has become something that has crossed any line. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=132.0s)]
*  And that is why this war has got to end and it has to end very soon. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=135.60000000000002s)]
*  In a moment, I'll talk to Benny Morris and Norman Finkelstein. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=141.28s)]
*  The first one year after he spoke to me from the hospitals inside Gaza, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=144.0s)]
*  I'm joined by the American medic, Dr. Mossab Nasser. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, Dr. Nasser, great to have you back on Uncensored, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=150.96s)]
*  albeit in even more appalling circumstances than the last time we spoke. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=154.08s)]
*  Just tell me what it's like there right now in Gaza. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  What you're hearing, what you're seeing, what the reality is. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=164.0s)]
*  Because international journalists like me aren't allowed in. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  As I keep berating Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  if you want people to believe what you're saying about this, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  let the international journalists in. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=178.48s)]
*  But they don't. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=180.32s)]
*  So we're reliant on very scant detail other than people like you who really know. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=181.28s)]
*  Well, thank you, Piers, for having me again. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=189.44s)]
*  It's been a year since we've talked. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=192.24s)]
*  I believe last time was May 2024 when I was actually at the European hospital in Gaza. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=193.68s)]
*  There was actually recently a bond and many, many civilians were killed in that attack. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=199.44s)]
*  You asked me how it is in Gaza today. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  The best example I can tell you as someone who lives in Texas [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  is that the Israelis, unfortunately, or the Israeli army, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=213.68s)]
*  treats the Palestinians in Gaza like animals. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=217.52s)]
*  Almost like the game hunting in a ranch in Texas where you have these high-fenced [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  ranches with exotic animals where hunters go and chase these animals from one side of the fence [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=230.56s)]
*  to the other and kill these animals. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=236.56s)]
*  That's unfortunately how the Israeli army treats the Palestinians in Gaza today like game. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  You can actually see the gratification on their faces when they [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=244.96s)]
*  hunt a child or a woman or destroy a school or a kindergarten. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  It's very sad to see that we have reached this reality that at this time in history, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=254.96s)]
*  people are treated like animals. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=262.72s)]
*  This is what we've heard at the beginning of the war that Palestinians are human animals. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  They have been treated as such for the past almost two years now while the entire world is watching. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=271.6s)]
*  Probably this is the best example as someone who lives in Texas and sees how [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  hunters go to these ranches to chase game. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  That's what we see in Gaza today. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  You have, I know, huge amounts of family and friends in Gaza. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=288.24s)]
*  How many have lost their lives, people that are close to you? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=292.08s)]
*  So far, personally, my entire family is in Gaza. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  I've lost 74 members so far. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  One of them is actually was my mother. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=303.12s)]
*  She died last year, almost a year ago. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=307.04s)]
*  And I just lost my nephew, who was 20 years old, had a life ahead of him, such a handsome, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=311.76s)]
*  intelligent, bright young man who went again like game in Texas. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=320.08s)]
*  He went to look for food for his family. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=326.96s)]
*  And he was targeted in Israeli airstrike and died of shrapnels in the chest and the head. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=329.36s)]
*  And in fact, he died between his father's arms. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=336.88s)]
*  He bled to death. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=340.72s)]
*  And by the time the ambulance arrived to take him to the hospital, he was declared dead. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=342.56s)]
*  So this is the reality. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=348.48s)]
*  I mean, so far, 74 members of my family have been lost in this vicious war. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=349.6s)]
*  And I can tell you, Piers, as a Palestinian, I'm not going to lie. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=354.32s)]
*  And I can tell you, Piers, as a Palestinian, I lead a humanitarian organization. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=357.52s)]
*  And we try to be as much as we can neutral and unbiased in our judgment. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=364.24s)]
*  But we're left with no choice but to speak up. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=370.08s)]
*  And I can tell you, watching these images coming out of Gaza on a daily basis of children [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=374.4s)]
*  being amputated, malnourished, head injuries, amputations, many are burnt to lives. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=378.32s)]
*  Until last night, we've seen those images coming out of Gaza. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=384.72s)]
*  I can tell you, show me the gas chambers, honestly. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=387.68s)]
*  The death in a gas chamber is 100 times more merciful than being burnt alive in an Israeli fire. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  That is the reality where we are today. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  So we are looking at the Holocaust live on 4K screens. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=400.24s)]
*  And our politicians, our human rights organizations, our celebrities are just watching and feel helpless. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=404.72s)]
*  I don't know if they endorse it or they can't speak up, but it's time to speak up. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=412.8s)]
*  You cannot just sit on the sidelines watching this horrific murder take place right on front [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=417.04s)]
*  of our eyes and then maybe 10 or 100 years from now say, well, we wish we've done something about it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=423.12s)]
*  This is the time. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=428.88000000000005s)]
*  As you know, the Israeli argument has remained that they are on a mission to take out Hamas. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=431.36s)]
*  They say Hamas continue to operate and live amongst civilian populations. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=439.04s)]
*  And therefore, as they take out the terrorists with these strikes, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  they are inevitably going to kill civilians in the process. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  But that doesn't make it an unjust or immoral war that they are defending themselves against [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=453.92s)]
*  a terrorist attack of enormous and horrific scale. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=460.16s)]
*  And this is the only way that they can dismantle Hamas. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  What is your response to them? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=467.28s)]
*  Piers, I think if that is really the case, that's the most failed military operation in history. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  You have one of the most sophisticated armies in the world with the most sophisticated technologies. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=475.84s)]
*  They can go and surgically get to Hamas, terrorists from Gaza or in Gaza if they want to. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  But that is not the case. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=488.4s)]
*  What we see is deliberate targeting of schools, of homes. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=489.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, my nephew was not a Hamas. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=495.2s)]
*  He's not even a Hamas sympathizer. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=497.52s)]
*  He went to look for food and he was killed, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  along with 24 innocent people like him were waiting in line to get food for their families. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=501.68s)]
*  It's a trophy hunt. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=506.24s)]
*  It has absolutely nothing to do with Hamas today. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=507.2s)]
*  It is basically an obvious and clear ethnic cleansing. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=510.48s)]
*  And only someone that lives in denial or someone who's honestly completely crazy would believe otherwise. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=513.92s)]
*  Well, you know, I've resisted the call from many that it's a genocide on the basis that [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=520.88s)]
*  it seemed to me that Israel for a long time, I believe, had a fundamental right to defend itself. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=528.0s)]
*  And that's what they were doing. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=532.64s)]
*  I have to say, when I listened to Smodrich, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=534.0s)]
*  one of the more right wing of a very right wing cabinet under Netanyahu talking the other day, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=536.88s)]
*  he was talking in clear genocidal language. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=542.32s)]
*  It was unarguable. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=544.96s)]
*  And when you look at what's happening on the ground in Gaza, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't see any plan other than the apparent total disintegration of all infrastructure there [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  and the killing of as many people as possible, all under the pretext that they say that they're [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=557.12s)]
*  going after only going after Hamas and doing so in as humane a way as possible. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=563.28s)]
*  It just doesn't seem that what we're seeing on a daily basis and hearing on a daily basis [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=568.48s)]
*  represents that pretext at all. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=574.64s)]
*  And I also see no endgame. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't understand what Israel's plan is here other than what Smodrich said it is, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=579.68s)]
*  which is to clear everybody out, which is that that is genocide. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=584.4799999999999s)]
*  If you eradicate a people from their home based on ethnicity, that is a genocide. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=588.4s)]
*  So, you know, all those who've been calling it that, and I've been resisting, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=594.0s)]
*  I've now been saying I find it very almost impossible to disagree now, given what we're [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=597.36s)]
*  witnessing. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=603.04s)]
*  Well, you've come a long way, Piers, and I admire you and I respect that you have really [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=605.36s)]
*  changed your position on what's happening in Gaza. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=610.56s)]
*  As I said, it's obvious you can't really deny the fact that what's happening is a genocide. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=614.9599999999999s)]
*  What's happening is an ethnic cleansing of an entire population. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=620.56s)]
*  Are you still with me? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=624.56s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=626.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=627.92s)]
*  So there's, it's undeniable. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=628.24s)]
*  You know, the mass starvation of children, the malnutrition that the children of Gaza [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=631.76s)]
*  are facing. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=638.72s)]
*  You know, we've just evacuated five children out of Gaza to Texas, actually, for treatment. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=639.2s)]
*  And one of them really straight to the ICU from Gaza, malnourished, broken bones, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=644.48s)]
*  amputated arm. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=650.08s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=651.76s)]
*  I carried those children between my arms all the way from, you know, from Egypt, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=652.64s)]
*  first evacuated from Gaza to Egypt and then to the U.S. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=656.88s)]
*  It's heartbreaking to see these children having to suffer that level of suffering [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=659.44s)]
*  for absolutely no reason. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=664.72s)]
*  This is not a war about Hamas. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=666.32s)]
*  This is not a war about, you know, defending the, you know, Israel defending itself. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=667.84s)]
*  This is simply a clear ethnic cleansing. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=672.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer or an attorney to give a label for what's happening, but many of the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=675.44s)]
*  historians, many of the lawyers have basically described what's happening in Gaza as a genocide. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=681.5200000000001s)]
*  And in fact, the food distribution plan that Israel is enforcing and forcing upon humanitarian [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=688.88s)]
*  organizations today clearly reflects that this is basically an ethnic cleansing of the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=695.28s)]
*  Palestinians, you know, having, you know, having the Palestinian household or family [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=700.56s)]
*  members basically to go and pick their aid from a specific location that's highly fenced with [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=707.04s)]
*  checkpoints effectively. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=714.16s)]
*  Again, it's another reason for Israel to kidnap more Palestinians and for them to disappear [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=715.92s)]
*  forever. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=721.84s)]
*  I still have many of my colleagues from Nasser Hospital have been kidnapped since the beginning [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=722.48s)]
*  of the war. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  These doctors have never come back. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=727.92s)]
*  You know, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiyah, he fought, you know, for his patients until the last second. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=730.4s)]
*  No one knows where his whereabouts. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=735.6s)]
*  All the news indicates that he's being tortured in Israeli jails. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=737.6s)]
*  Many, many amazing doctors had absolutely nothing to do with Hamas. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=741.36s)]
*  They just disappeared. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=745.44s)]
*  The targeting of journalists, targeting of aid workers, the targeting of children. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=747.5200000000001s)]
*  What does that have to do with Hamas? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=752.48s)]
*  And again, as I said, if you cannot defeat Hamas throughout all this time, almost what, 16, 17 [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=754.32s)]
*  months, to me, that's the most failed military operation in history. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=760.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, it's clearly not working because the hostages haven't been released. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=765.44s)]
*  They should be, absolutely should be, but they haven't been, which means the military [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=769.2s)]
*  operation by Israel's forces to secure the release just isn't working. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=773.92s)]
*  This strategy just does not work. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=777.92s)]
*  Listen, Dr. Nasser, it's great to talk to you. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=780.56s)]
*  Thank you for the work that you do. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=782.56s)]
*  I'm so sorry about the incredible loss to your family and your mother and your nephew [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=785.52s)]
*  and all the others that you've lost from your extended family and guys. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=789.8399999999999s)]
*  And my heart goes out to you and to your family. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=793.04s)]
*  It's become an utterly horrific war, this, and it has to end. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=795.68s)]
*  But I thank you for joining me again. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=800.0799999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Pierce. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=801.36s)]
*  Well, I'm going to be joined now by two people with very different views about the war, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=802.96s)]
*  Professor Norman Finkelstein and Benny Morris, Israeli historian. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=806.72s)]
*  Well, welcome to both of you. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=810.88s)]
*  Benny Morris, my main question right now for Benjamin Netanyahu, I put it to him on X directly. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=812.16s)]
*  And I said, if you're doing everything by the book and everything is justified and everything [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  is legal and you're not committing any war crimes or any of these things, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=826.96s)]
*  I simply asked him one simple question. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=831.36s)]
*  If you're doing nothing wrong, let international journalists go in and see for themselves. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=833.36s)]
*  And I think it is completely shameful that the Israeli government continues to stop [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=839.28s)]
*  international journalists from doing their job. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=844.56s)]
*  And it's down to the individual risk assessment will be by the journalists and their companies. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=846.8s)]
*  It was put to me two, three days ago by an IDF member that some house has been [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=851.36s)]
*  done for the safety of the journalists. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=858.1600000000001s)]
*  It's not. It's complete nonsense. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=859.6s)]
*  And that's not down to Israeli government anyway to make that call. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=861.36s)]
*  I mean, do you at least accept that it is wrong that journalists are not allowed in there? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=864.32s)]
*  I completely agree with you, Pierce. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=870.72s)]
*  The government has made a terrible mistake in not allowing journalists in. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  And whoever dies there dies, but they should have allowed them in. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=878.72s)]
*  But I would like to make a comment about what your previous guest was saying. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=882.16s)]
*  He said he spoke about objectivity or something. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=889.1999999999999s)]
*  The man is a total Hamas propagandist. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=892.16s)]
*  Half the things he said were outright lies. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=896.16s)]
*  Lots of doctors have been abducted and have disappeared. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=898.96s)]
*  It's total nonsense. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=902.0s)]
*  I know of one or two cases of doctors who were taken to an Israeli detention center. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=903.04s)]
*  What happened to them afterwards, I don't know. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=908.72s)]
*  I don't think they've been killed. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=910.48s)]
*  I think they are under arrest for whatever reason. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=912.0s)]
*  But he said that many doctors have been... [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=914.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, you're basically agreeing with him, aren't you? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=917.68s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=920.88s)]
*  I'm saying that he talked about many doctors. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=921.52s)]
*  You just said you know of some doctors who were detained. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=922.88s)]
*  You have no idea what happened to them. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=925.92s)]
*  I know of one or two doctors... [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=927.6s)]
*  You're confirming his story. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=929.4399999999999s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=932.24s)]
*  I'm confirming a small part of what is true. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=932.8s)]
*  The rest is a lie, as is a large part of what he's saying. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=936.0s)]
*  Had Israel wanted to kill all the Palestinians, that's what genocide actually means, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=939.76s)]
*  there would have been many, many, many more deaths in Gaza. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=945.04s)]
*  Each time Israel launches an air raid, we hear of the Palestinians saying 24 people have died, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=949.04s)]
*  30 people have died, and I'm sure many of them are civilians. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=955.92s)]
*  But I'm also sure that the Air Force going in against these targets is attacking Hamasniks. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=959.52s)]
*  We never hear from the Hamas how many of their people are being killed in these strikes. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=965.6s)]
*  All we hear about and all we see on television is dead babies and dead women. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=969.9200000000001s)]
*  They never show grown male, army-aged males being taken out of these ruins. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=974.32s)]
*  And the Hamas uses these things systematically. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  They have the schools, the hospitals, various so-called safe compounds to hide in. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=983.2s)]
*  Okay, but out of interest. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=990.48s)]
*  And behind this civilian shield. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=991.52s)]
*  But out of interest. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=991.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=992.5600000000001s)]
*  Benny Morris, when you hear someone like Smodrich last week talking about the campaign [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=993.68s)]
*  to just clear everybody up. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=998.48s)]
*  He's disgusting. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=999.68s)]
*  You don't have to convince me he's disgusting. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1000.24s)]
*  Right, but so my question for you, my question for you though is this. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1002.8s)]
*  All right, he's disgusting. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1007.44s)]
*  What he said was disgusting. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1008.72s)]
*  What he said was also genocidal. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1010.4s)]
*  So whereas you do not believe it's genocide what's going on, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1012.72s)]
*  he clearly is talking in a way which made me believe that actually [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1017.2s)]
*  maybe the intention is genocide. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1022.08s)]
*  It may not be the death of absolutely everybody, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1024.48s)]
*  but it means killing a lot of Palestinians and kicking the rest out of the area. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1027.3600000000001s)]
*  And that is a genocide. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1031.8400000000001s)]
*  No, no, a genocide is something which is top down government policy [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1034.64s)]
*  and carried out systematically. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1039.6000000000001s)]
*  That's not what is happening. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1041.1200000000001s)]
*  He is definitely some of his speeches are genocidal. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1043.04s)]
*  I don't know what he means exactly. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1046.16s)]
*  And there are other ministers who speak like him [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1047.76s)]
*  and they shouldn't be doing that. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1051.12s)]
*  And they may even have a genocidal mentality, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1053.12s)]
*  but they do not control government policy [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1056.1599999999999s)]
*  and they do not control what the army is doing. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1058.4799999999998s)]
*  That's done by the generals. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1060.8s)]
*  And unfortunately, in my mind, by a man called Netanyahu [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1062.3999999999999s)]
*  who's totally a corrupt and incompetent. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1066.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, okay, let me bring in Norman Finkelstein. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1069.12s)]
*  It's got nothing to do with, but it's got nothing to do with genocide. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1070.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, I think you're getting perilously close to agreeing with me. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1075.12s)]
*  Norman Finkelstein, I mean, the bottom line is, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1078.08s)]
*  if it sounds from the rhetoric like a genocide, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1080.8s)]
*  if the actions on the ground are becoming increasingly genocidal, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1085.04s)]
*  if there's no other plan being put out there [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1089.1999999999998s)]
*  for what happens to Palestinian people other than many more will die [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1091.28s)]
*  and the rest will be thrown out of Gaza, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1095.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't know what else you end up calling this. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1098.96s)]
*  And, you know, I listened to that doctor. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1101.6799999999998s)]
*  I didn't hear somebody that I felt was a Hamas sympathizer or propagandist. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1104.08s)]
*  He went out of his way to say he wasn't. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1109.52s)]
*  No, he's just a liar. He's a liar. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1111.12s)]
*  Well, he's a liar who's lost 78 members of his family. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1113.28s)]
*  So, I mean, Norman Finkelstein. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1116.32s)]
*  Maybe, maybe, and I agree, I feel sorry for him, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1118.0s)]
*  but they are caught up in a relatively bad situation [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1121.76s)]
*  where Hamas controls the population [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1124.6399999999999s)]
*  and is willing to sacrifice as many civilians as they can [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1128.6399999999999s)]
*  to win world support. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1132.08s)]
*  Well, which is exactly what Israel also seems like they're prepared to sacrifice. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1134.8s)]
*  Norman Finkelstein. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1138.72s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me on the program, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1141.6s)]
*  and I hope that you'll hear me out. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1143.84s)]
*  Is it a genocide? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1146.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, as you know, Pierce, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1148.08s)]
*  from the first time I appeared on your program many months ago, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1149.9199999999998s)]
*  I said it was a genocide. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1154.0s)]
*  I said it was perfectly obvious when October 9th, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1156.1599999999999s)]
*  the then Defense Minister Galon said, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1160.56s)]
*  we're not going to allow in any food, fuel, water or electricity. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1163.44s)]
*  Well, for a hermetically sealed population, that's a genocide. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1168.88s)]
*  When the head of state, Mr. Netanyahu, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1174.32s)]
*  compared the current situation with Amalek [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1177.76s)]
*  and invoked the biblical reference, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1181.44s)]
*  it was clear, as the Israeli human rights organization, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1184.0s)]
*  that Selim put it, that he was talking about genocide. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1187.28s)]
*  Now, in the 19 months that have elapsed, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1192.16s)]
*  there have been adjustments in Israeli policy due to external pressure. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1195.76s)]
*  That's called politics. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1201.36s)]
*  So when the external pressures escalated, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1203.52s)]
*  they had to diminish the genocide. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1206.8s)]
*  And then beginning roughly when Kamala Harris was [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1211.2s)]
*  nominated for president in the United States, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1215.2s)]
*  and all the cameras switched to the American election, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1218.64s)]
*  Mr. Netanyahu, who's very sensitive to and knowledgeable of the American media, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1223.52s)]
*  he then escalated the genocidal assault on Gaza again. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1229.92s)]
*  And then as you remember, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1235.3600000000001s)]
*  because I did several programs with you at that time, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1236.8s)]
*  as you'll remember, every day there was another massacre. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1241.28s)]
*  There were so many massacres, it was impossible to keep count, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1245.76s)]
*  and it was impossible to remember. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1249.68s)]
*  Now, again, there was something— [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1252.8s)]
*  But you forgot the first massacre. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1253.92s)]
*  —some lessening— [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1254.96s)]
*  You forget the first massacre, which was launched by Hamas. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1255.44s)]
*  I've not forgotten it. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1258.56s)]
*  Danny, but you have to remember manners. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1260.0s)]
*  I'll remember the massacres, and you remember manners. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1264.96s)]
*  I'm speaking now. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1268.4s)]
*  So there were times when Israel, as I said, escalated the genocide [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1270.24s)]
*  and then diminished the genocide. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1277.1200000000001s)]
*  Now, let's talk about the responsibility and the mindset. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1279.68s)]
*  You've mentioned Mr. Smoltrich. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1284.56s)]
*  I mentioned Mr. Netanyahu. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1287.3600000000001s)]
*  There was also several others whose names have constantly come up, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1290.4s)]
*  obviously Defense Minister Galant, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1294.24s)]
*  who was indicted along with Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1297.28s)]
*  by the International Criminal Court. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1301.28s)]
*  But it's not just the leadership. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1304.0s)]
*  It's not just the leadership. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1306.64s)]
*  The most recent poll showed that fully one-half of Israeli Jews— [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1308.88s)]
*  we're talking now about the population— [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1314.88s)]
*  fully one-half of Israeli Jews believe [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1317.52s)]
*  that Israel should conduct a genocide in Gaza. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1320.48s)]
*  That's what the poll result showed. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1324.24s)]
*  82 percent— [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1327.2s)]
*  That's a lie. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1328.3200000000002s)]
*  I know, Danny, everybody's lying. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1330.64s)]
*  There's never been a poll about supporting genocide. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1334.0800000000002s)]
*  Please, Mr.— [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1337.3600000000001s)]
*  This is nonsense. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1337.92s)]
*  Danny, you're purveying lies. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1338.56s)]
*  Okay, Danny. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1343.04s)]
*  Danny, I mean, this is a case of each other calling the— [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1344.48s)]
*  What is that poll, Norman? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1346.96s)]
*  It seems a very important poll. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1348.4s)]
*  What is that poll you're referring to? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1349.6000000000001s)]
*  It was a university—if my memory is correct, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1352.08s)]
*  it was a University of Pennsylvania poll. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1355.36s)]
*  It was reported everywhere. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1358.32s)]
*  Benny Marvis knows about the poll. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1361.04s)]
*  He's fully informed of the poll, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1364.24s)]
*  but he's doing his job as an official Israeli propagandist. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1366.96s)]
*  No, no, I have no job. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1370.24s)]
*  I don't like these governments. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1371.68s)]
*  I'm not their spokesman. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1374.3999999999999s)]
*  You should lie. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1375.6s)]
*  You've reduced yourself—Mr. Benny, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1377.44s)]
*  you've reduced yourself to the level of a Holocaust denier. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1380.56s)]
*  It's a real shame that you have sunk so low. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1384.3999999999999s)]
*  But allow me to continue. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1387.76s)]
*  The polls show that 82 percent of Israeli Jews, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1389.84s)]
*  82 percent support a forced expulsion from Gaza. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1394.96s)]
*  That's not the same as genocide. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1400.6399999999999s)]
*  That may be true. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1402.1599999999999s)]
*  That may be true, but that's not genocide. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1403.44s)]
*  That's not genocide. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1405.44s)]
*  What you said before about genocide is total nonsense. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1408.48s)]
*  Total nonsense. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1412.48s)]
*  Piers, you're going to have to ask Benny Marvis [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1414.16s)]
*  to please allow me to speak. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1417.92s)]
*  Well, Benny, I will let you respond to this. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1420.72s)]
*  You're taking up all the time, though. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1421.76s)]
*  Norman, you must give him a chance to respond. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1424.16s)]
*  Okay, I will finish. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1427.1200000000001s)]
*  I will finish. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1430.0s)]
*  Then one of the leaders of the opposition in Israel [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1431.76s)]
*  described Israeli soldiers as killing children as a hobby in Gaza. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1436.08s)]
*  Now, yes, he took it back. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1443.6s)]
*  He took it back after he came under ferocious attack. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1446.8s)]
*  But he himself acknowledged when I debated Mr. Marris about a year ago [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1452.0s)]
*  and I said that Israel targets children, he laughed. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1459.04s)]
*  He thought it was such a funny remark by me. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1464.0s)]
*  It's absolute nonsense. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1466.64s)]
*  No, I'm wondering. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1467.84s)]
*  Absolute nonsense. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1468.64s)]
*  I'm wondering. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1469.76s)]
*  I'm wondering. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1471.52s)]
*  After the foreign doctors in Gaza, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1473.44s)]
*  after the foreign doctors in Gaza [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1477.52s)]
*  attested that the children were being shot in the head and the chest. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1481.28s)]
*  And when one of the leaders of the opposition in Israel said [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1487.2s)]
*  that the Israeli soldiers killed children as a hobby. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1491.76s)]
*  Yes, I must let Benny respond, Norman. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1495.36s)]
*  I must let Benny respond. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1497.68s)]
*  Benny. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1499.68s)]
*  There has never been a poll asking Israelis whether they support genocide. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1501.52s)]
*  This is a total lie. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1506.24s)]
*  And the 50% figure is also something completely out of Norman Finkelstein's imagination. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1507.6s)]
*  His twisted mind, actually. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1513.52s)]
*  There is no targeting of children deliberately. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1515.92s)]
*  And what this politician said, and he's actually a very clever politician [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1519.04s)]
*  and usually tells things straight and the truth was a slip of the tongue. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1523.92s)]
*  And he said, I made a mistake. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1527.52s)]
*  I said the wrong thing and I shouldn't have used that phrase. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1529.04s)]
*  Stupid phrase. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1532.08s)]
*  Israeli soldiers do not target as a rule children. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1533.2s)]
*  There may be, and I'm sure there are and have been, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1537.92s)]
*  war crimes committed by Israeli soldiers and pilots perhaps. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1540.56s)]
*  In this war in the course of 19 months. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1545.1200000000001s)]
*  But I don't think we should forget that Hamas is a homicidal, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1547.44s)]
*  homophobic, misogynist, totalitarian organization which tried to kill as many [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1552.24s)]
*  Israelis as they could, most of them civilians on the 7th of August. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1558.64s)]
*  And what befell Gaza as a result is revenge for that attack by the Hamas. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1562.72s)]
*  And the Hamas said they would do the same thing again [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1568.88s)]
*  if they are revived and resuscitated as a leading organization in the Gaza Strip. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1571.52s)]
*  And I think that's the objective of the Israeli army to end Hamas rule [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1577.04s)]
*  and to end the Hamas as an organization in the Gaza Strip. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1581.76s)]
*  And anybody normal who doesn't support Islamists, doesn't support anti-Semitism, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1585.36s)]
*  doesn't support misogyny, doesn't support homophobia should be against Hamas, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1590.96s)]
*  which Norman Finkelstein apparently isn't. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1596.24s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't hear people supporting Hamas in certainly in mainstream media [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1599.1200000000001s)]
*  or anywhere else. Everyone's of a unanimity that what they did was unconscionable [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1605.0400000000002s)]
*  and they should be held to account. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1609.76s)]
*  The problem is that the strategy that the Israeli government is... [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1611.0400000000002s)]
*  And what they still want to do... [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1613.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes, I heard... [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1615.6000000000001s)]
*  The problem is what they still want to do and say they want to do. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1616.24s)]
*  Benny, let's just assume because they said it themselves, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1619.3600000000001s)]
*  in fact the spokesman said it after October the 7th, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1622.8000000000002s)]
*  that if they can do it again and again they will. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1625.68s)]
*  So they want to get rid of all the Jews in Israel. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1627.92s)]
*  Okay, that is Hamas. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1630.96s)]
*  And of the state of Israel. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1632.4s)]
*  And of the state of Israel. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1634.24s)]
*  But the problem is, as I've always said from the start of this, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1636.24s)]
*  what is a proportional response to what happened? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1639.28s)]
*  And what is the end game? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1642.5600000000002s)]
*  What does Israel actually want at the end of this? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1644.0800000000002s)]
*  And I'm beginning to think they don't have any plan at all. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1647.28s)]
*  That actually what they're hoping is that they can pursue the line [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1650.0800000000002s)]
*  of many of the more right-wing members of that cabinet, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1654.0s)]
*  maybe Netanyahu himself now has been [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1656.72s)]
*  traduced into this because he has no incentive to end the war [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1659.2800000000002s)]
*  because the moment it ends, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1662.3200000000002s)]
*  he'll be held accountable for allowing October the 7th to happen [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1663.5200000000002s)]
*  in the first place, which was hugely unpopular for him [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1666.24s)]
*  and the polls with the Israeli people. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1669.3600000000001s)]
*  But secondly, he's facing corruption charges in a criminal court [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1671.0400000000002s)]
*  the moment this is all over. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1674.72s)]
*  There is no incentive for him to end it. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1676.0s)]
*  And so this carries on and on with more and more Palestinians being killed. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1678.0800000000002s)]
*  And all right, you might have a belief that the IDF [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1681.76s)]
*  never deliberately target children, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1686.08s)]
*  but they are deliberately and relentlessly targeting civilian areas [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1687.9199999999998s)]
*  in their estimation going after Hamas. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1692.56s)]
*  But in the process, they know they are going to kill on a daily basis [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1695.36s)]
*  dozens, if not hundreds of innocent people as well. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1700.8s)]
*  And that's been going on now week after week, month after month. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1704.72s)]
*  And at some point, you surely have to concede [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1708.6399999999999s)]
*  that this strategy is not working. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1712.08s)]
*  It's making Israel global pariahs. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1714.16s)]
*  It's making Israel global pariahs. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1716.88s)]
*  There is no evidence that Hamas is being dismantled. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1719.0400000000002s)]
*  In fact, the opposite appears to be happening [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1722.24s)]
*  where for every Hamas terrorist killed, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1724.72s)]
*  they're apparently replacing them with multiple more people [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1726.8000000000002s)]
*  who share the ideology. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1730.16s)]
*  The hostages are not being released. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1732.16s)]
*  God knows how many of those hostages may be killed now [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1734.3200000000002s)]
*  with these intensifying airstrikes. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1736.96s)]
*  No, no. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1739.1200000000001s)]
*  Israel now says it's launching... [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1739.44s)]
*  Can I correct you? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1740.4s)]
*  Israel now says... [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1741.0400000000002s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1741.52s)]
*  Can I correct you about the hostages? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1742.16s)]
*  Israel now says it's launching a massive new attack. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1742.96s)]
*  Well, okay, bully for Israel, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1746.0s)]
*  but actually none of this seems to be working. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1748.64s)]
*  And so at some point... [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1751.6000000000001s)]
*  Can I correct you? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1752.72s)]
*  I say enough. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1753.28s)]
*  Yes, correct me. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1755.04s)]
*  Okay, I understood that. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1756.32s)]
*  Can I correct you on one small point? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1758.8s)]
*  The Hamas took, kidnapped 251 hostages, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1760.72s)]
*  most of them Israelis, some of them Nepalese, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1765.2s)]
*  some of them Thai on the 7th of October, 23. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1767.52s)]
*  Of those, 177 were actually released [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1771.12s)]
*  as a result of the Israeli counteroffensive [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1774.56s)]
*  in interim arrangements. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1777.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, they were released by diplomacy, actually. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1778.4799999999998s)]
*  They were released through diplomacy. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1781.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but the Israeli... [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1782.3999999999999s)]
*  No, no, Israeli military pressure [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1783.84s)]
*  is what persuaded the Hamas, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1786.08s)]
*  because they also wanted to cease fires. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1788.32s)]

*  Why isn't it working now? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1790.4799999999998s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1793.28s)]
*  Firstly, there's only 20 alive Israeli hostages [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1794.1599999999999s)]
*  left in the Hamas' hands. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1797.1999999999998s)]
*  I do believe that the government... [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1798.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, you don't know that. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1800.4s)]
*  We don't know that. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1802.16s)]
*  We know there are over 50... [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1802.96s)]
*  No, no, no, we... [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1804.24s)]
*  Over 50 are not accounted for. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1805.3600000000001s)]
*  No, no, we know there's 20 live ones, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1808.5600000000002s)]
*  and assume 38 dead ones. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1810.48s)]
*  That's what the Israeli intelligence knows. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1813.2s)]
*  Assume, but nobody knows for sure. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1813.68s)]
*  Okay, nobody knows for sure. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1816.3200000000002s)]
*  The government now, which was incompetent, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1818.64s)]
*  and I think incompetently managed this war, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1821.52s)]
*  that's why it stretched out for so long. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1824.16s)]
*  Though don't forget, we also had a war with Iran [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1826.24s)]
*  and with Hezbollah, and we continue to have [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1829.2s)]
*  a war with the Houthis from Yemen. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1831.76s)]
*  So it's not just been Israel focusing only on Gaza. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1834.16s)]
*  But the government... [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1837.3600000000001s)]
*  No, but in the war, if I may say, before I go back... [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1838.0s)]
*  Hang on, before I go back to Norman, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1840.24s)]
*  with the war with Hezbollah, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1842.4s)]
*  that was a scenario where Israel, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1844.64s)]
*  in terms of military operation, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1849.44s)]
*  brilliantly targeted 3,000 Hezbollah terrorists [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1852.16s)]
*  in a way that begs the question, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1857.2s)]
*  why could they not have done a similar operation on Hamas? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1859.2800000000002s)]
*  And I've heard all the excuses and explanations and arguments. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1863.0400000000002s)]
*  But in one case, Israel has now, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1866.5600000000002s)]
*  since October the 7th, 2023, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1869.68s)]
*  just launched endless strikes and assaults [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1873.3600000000001s)]
*  on civilian populations in Gaza, killing, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1876.88s)]
*  we don't know how many, but we know it's many tens of thousands, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1880.24s)]
*  including over 20,000 children. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1883.8400000000001s)]
*  In a population with 50% under 18. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1886.32s)]
*  And in their offensive against Hezbollah, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1889.9199999999998s)]
*  which was incredibly successful, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1892.96s)]
*  they targeted 3,000 terrorists with pages, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1895.12s)]
*  which have got exposures in. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1898.24s)]
*  There's a massive difference in the way that Israel's gone about [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1900.0s)]
*  these two counter-terrorist operations, as they would put it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1902.8799999999999s)]
*  And I would argue the way they went after Hezbollah [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1906.24s)]
*  had global support in a way that the way they've gone after Hamas in Gaza [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1909.28s)]
*  is increasingly making Israel a global pariah. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1914.96s)]
*  Norman, your response? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1918.48s)]
*  I agree with you completely. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1919.68s)]
*  But there were two reasons for that. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1922.24s)]
*  The first one is that Hamas has systematically [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1924.4s)]
*  hidden behind civilians and in tunnels underneath civilian centers. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1927.68s)]
*  Are we having a monologue? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1932.4s)]
*  Norman. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1935.76s)]
*  With all due respect to you, Piers, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1938.72s)]
*  I think there is a misunderstanding about what's been happening since October 7th. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1941.5200000000002s)]
*  Once October 7th happened, it was a crisis for Israel. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1947.44s)]
*  About that, there's no dispute. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1951.3600000000001s)]
*  But it was also viewed as the cliche had it. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1953.6000000000001s)]
*  It was also an opportunity. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1956.88s)]
*  And the opportunity was to once and for all solve the Gaza question. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1959.7600000000002s)]
*  Now, from day one, it was perfectly obvious that the goal of Israel was [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1965.2800000000002s)]
*  to solve the Gaza question through three methods. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1970.72s)]
*  One, ethnic cleansing. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1974.48s)]
*  Two, make Gaza unlivable. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1976.96s)]
*  And three, mass killing, mass death and destruction. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1979.6000000000001s)]
*  Now, if you look at it from that vantage point, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1985.1200000000001s)]
*  the operation has been hugely successful. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1990.24s)]
*  I don't know why, with all due regard, and I do respect you, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1993.92s)]
*  I don't know why you keep saying it's been unsuccessful. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=1998.0s)]
*  They've destroyed about 90 percent of the housing in Gaza. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2001.68s)]
*  They've destroyed about half the hospitals in Gaza. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2005.92s)]
*  They've destroyed about half the universities in Gaza. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2009.6s)]
*  They've destroyed about half the arable land in Gaza. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2013.2s)]
*  Gaza won't be inhabitable any time in the next two decades, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2016.96s)]
*  according to the best estimations by the international community, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2022.72s)]
*  international organizations, the World Bank, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2028.24s)]
*  and the National Monetary Fund, UNCTAD and so forth. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2035.68s)]
*  It's been hugely successful. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2039.92s)]
*  Where we're at now is the final phase. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2042.3200000000002s)]
*  And the final phase is why all the rats, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2046.0s)]
*  like the leadership in the UK right now, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2049.92s)]
*  and the French and the Canadians, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2053.44s)]
*  they're trying to jump off the sinking ship [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2056.4s)]
*  because they know exactly what Israel has in mind. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2059.84s)]
*  We're now at the apocalypse, the final phase. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2063.28s)]
*  Mr. Morris has written a lot about 1948 in Israel. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2067.92s)]
*  And in fact, what's happening now is very similar [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2073.52s)]
*  to what happened in October 1948. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2076.8s)]
*  If you read his books, which I have, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2080.1600000000003s)]
*  you see a massive escalation of atrocities during the 1948 war [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2082.7200000000003s)]
*  as they're trying to finish the job. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2089.2000000000003s)]
*  And now Israel is trying to finish the job. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2091.92s)]
*  If you read your own Financial Times, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2095.6000000000004s)]
*  it described very beautifully what this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation was about. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2098.7200000000003s)]
*  They were going to set up two or three distribution points in the south of Gaza. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2104.7999999999997s)]
*  And then everybody from the north and the middle of Gaza [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2110.64s)]
*  would have to go to the south in order to get food or water or medicine. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2114.7999999999997s)]
*  And then when everybody was congregated in the south, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2120.64s)]
*  what do you think is going to happen? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2124.56s)]
*  Exactly what happened in October 1948. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2127.04s)]
*  There were going to be the massacres. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2130.7999999999997s)]
*  Massacres. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2132.88s)]
*  You know what they were going to say. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2134.08s)]
*  Can I say something? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2135.52s)]
*  There was rioting. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2136.08s)]
*  There was rioting at the food distribution centers. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2138.0s)]
*  The IDF felt afraid. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2142.6400000000003s)]
*  And then it started to fire. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2146.08s)]
*  And then they hoped in one fell swoop, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2148.48s)]
*  they could send the whole population over the border into Egypt. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2152.0s)]
*  He likes to lecture. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2156.0s)]
*  It's perfectly obvious what Israel is doing now. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2156.88s)]
*  It's the last stage, or I should say, it's the final stage of the final solution. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2160.8s)]
*  And now some of the Western leaders don't want to have to dirty their hands with it. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2167.6000000000004s)]
*  So suddenly people like Lammy are discovering that it's intolerable, the situation in Gaza. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2172.7200000000003s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2180.32s)]
*  It's been intolerable since October 8. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2181.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2185.28s)]
*  Final word very briefly to you, Benny. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2186.0800000000004s)]
*  As far as I've understood, firstly at the moment there's discussions of a prisoner exchange [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2191.76s)]
*  and a ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas, which may work out and give the Hamas a breathing [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2197.92s)]
*  space of 60 days at least in which to reorganize and whatever. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2204.0800000000004s)]
*  But the Israeli military plan as far as it's been published is to take over essentially [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2208.96s)]
*  75% and maybe by the end 100% of the Gaza Strip and root out the Hamas [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2215.1200000000003s)]
*  kill the Hamas people or get them to surrender and leave the territory [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2220.7999999999997s)]
*  and to supply the Palestinian population in three centers, not just in the south [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2227.68s)]
*  but also in the north with humanitarian aid if the Hamas will allow it to come through [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2233.68s)]
*  because the Hamas have been taking most of the humanitarian aid. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2240.4s)]
*  Stop the lying, Benny. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2242.72s)]
*  Benny, try to stop lying for one minute. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jN7IEYNOs&t=2243.92s)]
