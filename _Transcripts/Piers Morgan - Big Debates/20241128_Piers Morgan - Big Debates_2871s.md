Video Description: The total destruction of Gaza and the expulsion of its Palestinian inhabitants seems pretty much inevitable now, and while this suffering could not have happened without the actions of the Israeli Defence Forces, accusations for where ultimate responsibility lies have been thrown in all directions. 

As Piers Morgan Uncensored is a haven for freedom of speech, many points of view have been expressed on the show, and tonight, two of the most fervent supporters of each side, political scientist and pro-Palestine activist Norman Finkelstein and Israeli Special Envoy for Trade & Innovation Fleur Hassan, face off in the studio.

Finkelstein lays out the scale of the destruction and death that has blighted Gaza, while Fleur pokes holes in nearly all of his claims. There are moments when Piers struggles to keep the peace between them, but at least the discussion is anything but dull.

# “Gaza Is NO MORE” Norman Finkelstein vs Fleur Hassan | Israel Showdown
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [November 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc)
*  Gaza is no more. Gaza has been pulverized, it's been obliterated, and that was the Israeli goal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=0.0s)]
*  What happens to these people? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=7.84s)]
*  Well, Gazan civilians today have an opportunity after Hamas... [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  No, no, that's not my question. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=12.72s)]
*  ...that has subjugated them to rebuild their society. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=13.56s)]
*  Fine, that wasn't my question. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=16.48s)]
*  If I need psychoanalysis, I wouldn't go to a representative of a limited state. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  You have to understand where normal thinking stands in this head, okay? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=22.92s)]
*  First of all, he doesn't believe in the existence of the State of Israel. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  It's very difficult arguing with somebody that doesn't believe he should exist at all. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Mark, your imagination left. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=32.8s)]
*  Keep your distance, Kate. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=36.04s)]
*  The Nazis needed the cover of a war in order to carry out the final solution. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=37.72s)]
*  Everything this man talks about is a blood libel. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=42.96s)]
*  I want to ask... [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=46.76s)]
*  And he's having his five minutes in the sun because today it's trending to hate Israel and hate Israel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=47.56s)]
*  No. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=53.16s)]
*  He's a short-ass. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=53.68s)]
*  My answer is... [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=54.28s)]
*  He doesn't have short-asses. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=54.96s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=56.08s)]
*  Israel's war on Hezbollah is over for now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=59.56s)]
*  The ceasefire ends almost 14 months of fighting and two months of a direct and deadly assault by Israel inside Lebanon. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=62.56s)]
*  President Biden and the US administration push to get the deal done before Thanksgiving, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=69.56s)]
*  and no doubt this is the first good news from the Middle East in a long time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=73.76s)]
*  But 170 miles to the south has very little to feel grateful about. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=77.76s)]
*  Israel's war on Hamas continues unabated and the IDF's conduct is facing intensifying scrutiny. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=81.56s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and SACC Defence Minister Yoav Galant face ICC arrest warrants for war crimes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=88.56s)]
*  Reports by the New York Times and others accuse the IDF of habitually using captured Garzons as human shields. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=94.56s)]
*  President Trump has assembled a stridently pro-Israel cabinet with little patience for his critics. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=101.56s)]
*  Many supporters of the Palestinian cause fear that life beyond the war holds precious little cause for optimism [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=107.56s)]
*  and that the very concept of a two-state solution may now be dead. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=113.56s)]
*  To debate this, I'm joined by two of the strongest voices on this conflict, both with very opposite positions. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=117.56s)]
*  Fleur Hassam is the Israel special envoy for trade and innovation, as well as the former deputy mayor of Jerusalem. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=123.56s)]
*  Norma Finkelstein is a political scientist and pro-Palestine activist, also the new book, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=129.56s)]
*  Gaza's Grave Diggers, an inquiry into corruption in high places. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=134.56s)]
*  Well, welcome to both of you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=138.56s)]
*  I've never met either of you. I've interviewed you both several times, but it's great to meet you both in person. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=140.56s)]
*  And I appreciate you prepared to do this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=145.56s)]
*  A lot of people in this war period have not wanted to debate with people, especially on the other side. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=147.56s)]
*  So I appreciate that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=155.56s)]
*  Norman, you've got a new book out, and I'll come to that in more detail as we go on. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=156.56s)]
*  But just talking about where we are right now, we've got this ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=161.56s)]
*  There is no ceasefire yet with Hamas. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=170.56s)]
*  But where do you think this war now is? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=173.56s)]
*  Well, with all due respect, I have to disagree with your characterization of where it began and where it now is. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=178.56s)]
*  In my opinion, speaking on the basis of what Israeli leaders themselves said after October 7, this isn't a war against Hamas. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=187.56s)]
*  This is a war against Gaza. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=198.56s)]
*  In fact, it's not a war at all. It's a genocide. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=200.56s)]
*  And in the course of that genocide, we could say as of now, the best estimates are there are about 42 million tons of rubble in Gaza. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=204.56s)]
*  It would take about 10 to 15 years to clear out the rubble. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=215.56s)]
*  And even if the rubble were cleared out, there are no prospects for rebuilding Gaza, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=219.56s)]
*  because Israel will claim that any cement that enters Gaza will be used to build tunnels. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=224.56s)]
*  And so they'll bar cement, as they did after Operation Cast Lead in 2008-9. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=230.56s)]
*  So where we are now, I would say Gaza is no more. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=237.56s)]
*  Gaza has been pulverized. It's been obliterated. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=242.56s)]
*  And that was the Israeli goal from October 7. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=247.56s)]
*  As you recall for sure, the statements that immediately came out after October 7 spoke about Amalek, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=251.56s)]
*  spoke about there not being any civilians in Gaza. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=259.56s)]
*  The intention was to once and for all liquidate, solve the Gaza question. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=262.56s)]
*  And in my opinion, they have succeeded in that regard. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=269.56s)]
*  And the prospects for the people of Gaza, my guess is, and it's pure speculation here, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=273.56s)]
*  by Hook or by Crook, they're going to find a way to leave, because there is nothing that remains. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=280.56s)]
*  The estimate is about 60 to 70 percent of Gaza's infrastructure has been destroyed. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=286.56s)]
*  The hospitals were targeted. The universities were targeted. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=292.56s)]
*  Obviously homes were targeted. So there is nothing left. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=296.56s)]
*  And that was the intention. The Gaza Hamas aspect was pretty much a sideshow. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=301.56s)]
*  So for example, if you look at the statistics from the Israeli government, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=309.56s)]
*  less than one Israeli soldier has been killed each day in Gaza. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=313.56s)]
*  But that's not a war. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=319.56s)]
*  When you say it's a sideshow, I'm going to come to Fler for a proper response to that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=321.56s)]
*  Say it's a sideshow. You imply that Israel were going to do this anyway, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=325.56s)]
*  but they hadn't done this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=329.56s)]
*  And everything that they have done, they would say, was a direct response to what was a monstrous act of terrorism. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=331.56s)]
*  I mean, 1,200 people were killed. Nearly 7,000 people were wounded. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=337.56s)]
*  It's one of the worst attacks of modern times. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=341.56s)]
*  And as you know, we've debated this many times, but I have always supported Israel's right to defend itself. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=344.56s)]
*  In fact, I've always believed they had a duty to, given the scale of what happened with 3,000 people coming over a border [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=351.56s)]
*  and just murdering anyone who could get their hands on. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=356.56s)]
*  It's to me always been a case of what is a proportionate response, what is acceptable. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=359.56s)]
*  I personally feel it has gone way too far. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=364.56s)]
*  And for the reasons that you state, and I'll come to you, Fler, is that there's nothing left there now. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=368.56s)]
*  I don't know what people expect to happen. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=373.56s)]
*  Fler, let me bring you in. Let me pick up on that point first, and you can get into the rest of what Norman said. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=375.56s)]
*  But Gaza's just been flattened. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=380.56s)]
*  I mean, it is...I know people who've been there who just say it is an utter devastation. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=383.56s)]
*  What happens after this war? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=390.56s)]
*  I mean, assuming that it ends sooner rather than later. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=392.56s)]
*  We've seen Israel now end the war with Hezbollah, certainly for the next 60 days. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=395.56s)]
*  But what happens...Gaza's done this, isn't it? What happens to these people? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=400.56s)]
*  Well, I know. I actually think they have an incredible opportunity, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=404.56s)]
*  because in 2005, when Israel left Gaza, in order to give the Palestinian leadership a chance to create maybe the pilot [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=407.56s)]
*  of a Palestinian state and beautiful Mediterranean coastline, they could have turned it into Dubai or Singapore. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=414.56s)]
*  But instead, when Hamas got in in a brutal coup in 2006, what happened is they turned Gaza essentially into a military base. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=419.56s)]
*  They filled it out with tunnels, 800 kilometers of tunnels. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=428.56s)]
*  They built under hospitals. They built those tunnels. They built booby traps. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=430.56s)]
*  They didn't build tunnels under hospitals. They built hospitals on top of tunnels. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=436.56s)]
*  There's like 30 hospitals in Gaza. In the whole of Israel, there's like 12. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=441.56s)]
*  But that's 20 years ago, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=445.56s)]
*  Well, no, no. They've spent 20 years turning the whole of Gaza into one booby trap for this Armageddon moment. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=447.56s)]
*  But that's not an answer to my question. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=454.56s)]
*  The answer is what happens now? If you ask me... [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=456.56s)]
*  What happens to 1.9 million people who've been sent to refugee camps that have now been attacked as well? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=458.56s)]
*  What happens to these people? A lot of their homes are just gone. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=464.56s)]
*  To be clear, the refugee camps, there are safe spaces where Hamas also infiltrate, and they put their own people. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=467.56s)]
*  They use them as human shields, as we know has been reported, and they put their people in homes. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=474.56s)]
*  Where is their safe... [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=479.56s)]
*  What happens now? If you ask me where the light is... [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=480.56s)]
*  On that one point you just said, though, where are they supposed to go to be safe? Right now. Where did Gazans go? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=483.56s)]
*  Mr Finkelstein said that we're engaged in a genocide. If we were, why are we asking people to get out of the way? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=489.56s)]
*  Well, let me ask you again. Where can they... [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=495.56s)]
*  Why are we giving warning? Why are we damaging our own element of surprise? Why are we doing that? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=497.56s)]
*  My question was, where should the Gazan civilians go to be safe? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=502.56s)]
*  The Gazan civilians today have an opportunity after Hamas... [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=506.56s)]
*  No, no, that's not my question. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=509.56s)]
*  ...that has subjugated them to rebuild their society. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=510.56s)]
*  Fine. That wasn't my question. My question is, where can they currently go to be safe? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=513.56s)]
*  To the safe spaces that Israel has assigned, where Israel is not attacking. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=518.56s)]
*  Where? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=521.56s)]
*  Well, it depends where. At one point they moved them from Ra'afah. They said it couldn't be done. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=522.56s)]
*  You can't move a million people. We did, with absolutely almost zero casualties. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=526.56s)]
*  And so it can be done. You can move a population out of the way. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=530.56s)]
*  Hamas is actively putting them in the way. That is what nobody talks about. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=534.56s)]
*  The other argument... [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=538.56s)]
*  Double war crime of Hamas. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=539.56s)]
*  Yes, but the other argument is that Israel is indiscriminately attacking everywhere and then saying, you know what, Hamas are there. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=540.56s)]
*  And because no... Hang on. Because no journalists are allowed in to verify this because the IDF won't let them. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=547.56s)]
*  There is no independent way of verifying whether any of that is true. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=553.56s)]
*  If we were indiscriminately attacking, why are we asking people to get out of the way? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=557.56s)]
*  Why are we creating safe zones? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=561.56s)]
*  All of what he's saying... [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=563.56s)]
*  I will bring you in, Nomi. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=565.56s)]
*  You have to understand where normal Finkelstein is in his head, OK? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=566.56s)]
*  First of all, he doesn't believe in the existence of the state of Israel. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=569.56s)]
*  So it's very difficult arguing somebody that doesn't believe he should exist at all. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=572.56s)]
*  Secondly, as a Jew, he's got what I... As a Jew... [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=575.56s)]
*  Let me finish my point and then you can interrupt. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=580.56s)]
*  Please don't talk about my head. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=583.56s)]
*  As a Jew... [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=584.56s)]
*  Talk about your head. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=585.56s)]
*  As a Jew, you know, Norman Finkelstein has got what I describe as the abuse wife syndrome. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=586.56s)]
*  The abuse wife that stays with her abusive husband has to justify her staying in three ways. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=593.56s)]
*  One is saying, it's not all that bad, which is what he says about anti-Semitism. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=599.56s)]
*  The second is saying, well, they didn't mean it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=603.56s)]
*  Anti-Semitism, they didn't really mean to target Jews. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=606.56s)]
*  And the third way, which is he's actively engaging, is to saying, it's our fault. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=609.56s)]
*  It's my fault. The wife that says, I would have... [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=613.56s)]
*  All right, I'll come to Norman to respond to that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=615.56s)]
*  I provoked him. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=617.56s)]
*  Before I come... [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=618.56s)]
*  And this is the abuser's... [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=619.56s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=620.56s)]
*  ...abusive mindset... [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=621.56s)]
*  He made your point and he will respond. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=622.56s)]
*  ...that he is in. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=623.56s)]
*  The Israeli Jew is the liberated Jew... [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=624.56s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=626.56s)]
*  ...that has left the abusive husband. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=627.56s)]
*  Fine. Before I go to Norman to respond to that, which I'm sure he'll want to, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=628.56s)]
*  the point that you were going to answer, and I made you answer a different one [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=632.56s)]
*  because you raised it, but what happens at the end of this war? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=635.56s)]
*  You want to know what I think should happen? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=639.56s)]
*  No, what is going to happen? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=641.56s)]
*  Well, I believe... [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=642.56s)]
*  What's the plan? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=643.56s)]
*  I believe... [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=644.56s)]
*  What have Israel got as plans? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=645.56s)]
*  Well, I believe that with Trump coming into power in the United States [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=646.56s)]
*  and with a Saudi deal on the table, which has been on the table, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=649.56s)]
*  and this is one of the reasons that they started the massacre on October 7th... [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=652.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=655.56s)]
*  ...at the beginning, they understood where the... [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=656.56s)]
*  The Iranians understood where this was all going. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=658.56s)]
*  They deployed Hamas and they said, this is the moment now. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=661.56s)]
*  So I believe that there's a real opportunity for the Gazans, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=664.56s)]
*  for the good Gazans who want a decent life for themselves [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=667.56s)]
*  and not living a life of terrorism. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=670.56s)]
*  To do what? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=671.56s)]
*  To rebuild. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=672.56s)]
*  How? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=673.56s)]
*  Under the, maybe, civil administration of their own local leaders. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=674.56s)]
*  Where do they go to live when all their homes have been destroyed? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=679.56s)]
*  Where their own local leaders, with Saudis, with Emiratis, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=681.56s)]
*  who know how to build quickly, who have the resources to build quickly, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=684.56s)]
*  if we really have a consortium of countries, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=688.56s)]
*  like the Abraham Accord countries, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=691.56s)]
*  that can get together and rebuild, there is an opportunity. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=693.56s)]
*  But still under Israel control? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=696.56s)]
*  I don't think Israel should be controlling them. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=698.56s)]
*  So Israel would back off completely? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=700.56s)]
*  We have to retain security control so we don't have another massacre. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=702.56s)]
*  Right, so you would have control. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=704.56s)]
*  But not administrative control. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=705.56s)]
*  All right, well, you just said you would have control. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=706.56s)]
*  But eventually, eventually we don't have to have any control. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=708.56s)]
*  You know what, eventually it would be really nice, actually, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=710.56s)]
*  if Israel had no control over the Saudis. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=712.56s)]
*  Yes, why did we leave in 2005? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=713.56s)]
*  Let me bring it up. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=715.56s)]
*  Why did we leave in 2005? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=716.56s)]
*  Okay, I'm back to you. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=717.56s)]
*  Norman, your chance to respond. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=718.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=719.56s)]
*  Number one, totally trivial point. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=720.56s)]
*  If I need psychoanalysis, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=723.56s)]
*  I wouldn't go to a representative of a lunatic state. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=726.56s)]
*  I would go to a rational person. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=729.56s)]
*  Number two, Israel never left Gaza. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=731.56s)]
*  That's not my opinion. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=735.56s)]
*  In 2005, Israel relocated its troops from inside Gaza [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=737.56s)]
*  to the periphery of Gaza. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=744.56s)]
*  What goes into Gaza, what goes out of Gaza. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=746.56s)]
*  Who goes into Gaza, who goes out of Gaza? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=750.56s)]
*  The airspace, the water, everything was controlled by Israel. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=753.56s)]
*  The guardian of the Fourth Geneva Convention [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=758.56s)]
*  is the International Committee of the Red Cross. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=761.56s)]
*  The opinion of the Red Cross from 2006 to the present [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=763.56s)]
*  is that Israel remains the occupying power in Gaza. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=768.56s)]
*  That's the opinion of the United Nations. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=773.56s)]
*  It's the opinion of all human rights organizations. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=775.56s)]
*  I don't disagree with you about any of that. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=777.56s)]
*  But let me ask you this, Norman. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=778.56s)]
*  Straight question. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=779.56s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=780.56s)]
*  I actually don't disagree with your assessment, right? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=781.56s)]
*  I do think Israel has exercised a control over the people of Gaza [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=785.56s)]
*  ever since they said they ceded control to a government. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=789.56s)]
*  But let me ask you one question before you finish your answer, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=793.56s)]
*  which is this. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=795.56s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=796.56s)]
*  There can be no doubt that Hamas was given billions of dollars, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=797.56s)]
*  a lot of it encouraged by Netanyahu, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=801.56s)]
*  given billions of dollars, which they did in fact squander, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=803.56s)]
*  which they did squander to the detriment of their people, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=807.56s)]
*  which they did by building all these tunnels, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=810.56s)]
*  and which they did in the end when they invaded Israel, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=813.56s)]
*  October the 7th, they knew absolutely what would happen. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=816.56s)]
*  And therefore in that moment they sentenced to death [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=820.56s)]
*  tens of thousands of their own people. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=823.56s)]
*  Would you quibble with that? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=825.56s)]
*  And don't forget, their leaders are billionaires. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=826.56s)]
*  Their leaders are billionaires. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=828.56s)]
*  I will actually, with all due respect, because I respect the facts, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=829.56s)]
*  I'll quibble with everything you said. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=835.56s)]
*  Number one, the money that went into Gaza, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=838.56s)]
*  mostly from European countries and other international organisations, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=841.56s)]
*  they monitored where the money went very carefully. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=845.56s)]
*  They weren't about to endow Hamas. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=848.56s)]
*  There's no evidence. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=852.56s)]
*  How did Hamas build all the tunnels? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=854.56s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=856.56s)]
*  But how did they afford to? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=857.56s)]
*  They don't have one penny of accountability. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=858.56s)]
*  No, I'll come to you. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=860.56s)]
*  No, one penny of accountability. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=861.56s)]
*  I'll come to you to respond. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=862.56s)]
*  Allow me. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=863.56s)]
*  Allow me. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=864.56s)]
*  I will challenge both of you, but don't shout over each other. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=865.56s)]
*  No, one penny of accountability. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=867.56s)]
*  He's living in an alternate universe. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=869.56s)]
*  The European governments and many of the international economic [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=871.56s)]
*  organisations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=875.56s)]
*  UNCTAD, UN Conference for Trade and Development, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=879.56s)]
*  they all put out on probably a quarterly basis [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=883.56s)]
*  very precise reports on Gaza. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=886.56s)]
*  None, and I've read all the reports over 10 or 20 years now, 17 years. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=888.56s)]
*  None of the reports have claimed that the catastrophe, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=895.56s)]
*  the economic catastrophe in Gaza has been caused by Hamas. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=900.56s)]
*  None. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=904.56s)]
*  Now, if you claim that you have more expertise in the subject [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=905.56s)]
*  than the IMF and the World Bank and UNCTAD, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=909.56s)]
*  well, you can believe that. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=913.56s)]
*  I personally don't believe that. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=915.56s)]
*  The claim of all of these international respected organisations [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=917.56s)]
*  is the main source, the root cause of the catastrophe in Gaza [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=922.56s)]
*  prior to October 7. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=927.56s)]
*  The root cause has been the medieval blockade that Israel imposed on it [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=929.56s)]
*  and which Human Rights Watch just in November 2024, a month ago, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=934.56s)]
*  Human Rights Watch described as, quote, a crime against humanity. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=940.56s)]
*  But how did... [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=945.56s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=946.56s)]
*  But Norman, how did Hamas afford to build all these tunnels? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=948.56s)]
*  You know, Piers, I never quarrel with facts. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=952.56s)]
*  I'll give you an honest answer. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=956.56s)]
*  How does he afford? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=958.56s)]
*  He's going to tell you there's no tunnels in the minipias. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=959.56s)]
*  Well, I think the amount of tunnels has been vastly exaggerated, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=961.56s)]
*  but I'll admit I can't prove that. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=967.56s)]
*  I've talked to civil engineers in Gaza about the possibility [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=969.56s)]
*  Israel claims 450 miles of tunnels. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=973.56s)]
*  I find that totally incredible. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=976.56s)]
*  There are billions of dollars worth of tunnels. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=978.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=980.56s)]
*  I'm not a civil engineer. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=981.56s)]
*  He wants us to remain in power. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=983.56s)]
*  What I do know, I'm perfectly willing to discuss. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=985.56s)]
*  What I don't know, I'm not a civil engineer. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=988.56s)]
*  I can't answer. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=991.56s)]
*  What I can say is the following. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=993.56s)]
*  Let's get back to the question of what's happened in Gaza. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=995.56s)]
*  You said Israel is in the war with Hamas. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=998.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1001.56s)]
*  So has the other guest in this room. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1002.56s)]
*  My name's Fleur. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1004.56s)]
*  What is your name? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1006.56s)]
*  Fleur. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1007.56s)]
*  Fleur. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1008.56s)]
*  So has Fleur. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1009.56s)]
*  Let me ask you a simple question, okay? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1010.56s)]
*  If you're at war with Gaza, why are you shooting children [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1012.56s)]
*  in the skull and in the chest? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1016.56s)]
*  The New York Times published an article on that, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1018.56s)]
*  came under a lot of flak because they published [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1021.56s)]
*  that article. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1024.56s)]
*  They said we can't refute the evidence. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1025.56s)]
*  We have the X-rays in front of us. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1027.56s)]
*  They're shooting children in the head, in the skull, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1029.56s)]
*  and in the chest. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1032.56s)]
*  If you're engaged in the war in Gaza, why are you killing [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1034.56s)]
*  journalists? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1037.56s)]
*  Why are you killing medics? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1038.56s)]
*  Why are you killing UN workers? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1040.56s)]
*  If you're engaged in the war with Hamas, why is it that [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1042.56s)]
*  Human Rights Watch just this past week put out a report? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1046.56s)]
*  They tell people where to flee. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1050.56s)]
*  They say go to the safe zones. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1052.56s)]
*  Human Rights Watch says when the people are directed, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1054.56s)]
*  they're being shot at at the road. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1058.56s)]
*  Are you seriously saying? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1060.56s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1062.56s)]
*  When they get to the safe areas... [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1063.56s)]
*  I understand. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1065.56s)]
*  I've already made that point. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1066.56s)]
*  Israel drops 2,000-pound bombs on them. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1067.56s)]
*  I've made that very point. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1069.56s)]
*  Does that sound like a war or does that sound like a genocide? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1070.56s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1073.56s)]
*  Okay, let's get into that because it's an interesting part [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1075.56s)]
*  of the debate. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1078.56s)]
*  It's horrendous that UN workers, journalists, children, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1079.56s)]
*  women have all been killed. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1083.56s)]
*  Targeted. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1085.56s)]
*  They quibble with the word targeted. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1086.56s)]
*  They say it's collateral damage as they've gone after terrorists. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1089.56s)]
*  When you shoot a child... [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1092.56s)]
*  Here's my question, Norman. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1094.56s)]
*  When you shoot a child in the skull, that's not collateral damage. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1096.56s)]
*  Norman, can you tell me any war where innocent people have not [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1099.56s)]
*  been killed in large numbers? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1103.56s)]
*  I'm not talking about innocent people. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1104.56s)]
*  He's talking about Hamas terrorists. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1106.56s)]
*  This is not collateral damage. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1108.56s)]
*  This is not even indiscriminate killing. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1111.56s)]
*  This is very discriminated killing. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1115.56s)]
*  It's discriminately indiscriminate bombing of the entire infrastructure. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1118.56s)]
*  If they wanted genocide, though, why don't they just kill everyone [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1125.56s)]
*  in Gaza? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1127.56s)]
*  There's a very simple answer to that question, Piers, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1128.56s)]
*  because even take... [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1133.56s)]
*  I know you're not allowed to say it, but since I know the topic very [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1135.56s)]
*  well, take the case of the Nazis. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1138.56s)]
*  The Nazis needed the cover of a war in order to carry out the final [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1140.56s)]
*  solution. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1145.56s)]
*  Now, Hitler had plans earlier on, but it required a certain amount [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1146.56s)]
*  of cover, propaganda, and all sorts of other devices in order to [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1151.56s)]
*  carry it out. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1158.56s)]
*  Gaza is in the news. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1159.56s)]
*  It's very hard to carry... [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1161.56s)]
*  Do you believe Israel had a right to defend itself after October 7? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1163.56s)]
*  Actually, if you want to hear my full answer, I'm not giving you a [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1166.56s)]
*  yes or no. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1169.56s)]
*  What's the short answer? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1170.56s)]
*  It doesn't have short answers. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1171.56s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1173.56s)]
*  I don't have short answers. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1174.56s)]
*  I've said it to you before. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1176.56s)]
*  In my opinion, Israel... [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1178.56s)]
*  Here it's not my opinion. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1181.56s)]
*  I'll quote Giora Eiland, the former head of Israel's National Security [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1183.56s)]
*  Council. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1187.56s)]
*  Israel create, I'm quoting him now in 2004, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1188.56s)]
*  he said Gaza is, quote, a huge concentration camp. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1192.56s)]
*  Israel created a huge concentration camp in Gaza. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1196.56s)]
*  Israel imposed a medieval blockade on Gaza, which has been characterized [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1200.56s)]
*  as a crime against humanity. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1204.56s)]
*  Israel periodically went into Gaza on its high-tech killing sprees, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1207.56s)]
*  what they called operations. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1212.56s)]
*  I would say Israel created, I think I'm quoting now, the British economist [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1214.56s)]
*  called Gaza a toxic dump. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1221.56s)]
*  Israel created a situation where you have children. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1224.56s)]
*  I understand how old are your children? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1228.56s)]
*  From 31 down to 12. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1230.56s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1232.56s)]
*  Imagine if your child, you're a father, your child was born into what [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1233.56s)]
*  Giora Eiland called a concentration camp. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1241.56s)]
*  Your child was left to languish in that concentration camp. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1245.56s)]
*  It sounds like you're working up a justification. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1251.56s)]
*  He's completely justified. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1254.56s)]
*  I could explain where he's coming from. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1256.56s)]
*  I do need to bring Claire in. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1260.56s)]
*  This is not, yes, you do. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1262.56s)]
*  You need a psychologist. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1264.56s)]
*  She does need to respond. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1266.56s)]
*  This is a one-on-one interview. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1268.56s)]
*  She probably thinks you're a lunatic too. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1270.56s)]
*  Fine, fine. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1272.56s)]
*  And by October 7, as you recall, Gaza had disappeared from the [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1275.56s)]
*  international stage. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1282.56s)]
*  All the talk was about the Abraham Accords, whether Saudi Arabia. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1284.56s)]
*  So your child was destined to be born into languishing and die in a [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1288.56s)]
*  concentration camp. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1295.56s)]
*  Israel created those conditions. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1297.56s)]
*  My view is Israel forfeited its right of self-defence based on its [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1300.56s)]
*  criminal abuse of the population of Gaza for 20 years. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1309.56s)]
*  Just to extrapolate that. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1314.56s)]
*  I'm very clear. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1317.56s)]
*  There's no need for extrapolation. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1319.56s)]
*  Israel forfeited its right of self-defence. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1321.56s)]
*  Does that mean then that what happened was justified? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1324.56s)]
*  I will stick by my formulation. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1328.56s)]
*  Israel forfeited its right to self-defence by having... [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1331.56s)]
*  But was Hamas justified by your logic? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1335.56s)]
*  Was Hamas justified? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1338.56s)]
*  If your children were in that situation, I suspect as a final [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1341.56s)]
*  resort, they might very well have done what happened. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1350.56s)]
*  By his logic, there's 100 children in tunnels and dungeons in Gaza [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1355.56s)]
*  right now, innocent people, not soldiers, taken hostage. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1361.56s)]
*  If it was your child, then it justifies everything. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1366.56s)]
*  By his very logic, somebody takes away your children. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1369.56s)]
*  Let her respond. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1375.56s)]
*  First of all, let's just come back from Gotham. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1377.56s)]
*  Because Norman has gone as far as I've heard him do in effectively [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1381.56s)]
*  saying it was a justified attack. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1386.56s)]
*  Israel has no right to self-defence. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1389.56s)]
*  Of course he's going to say that because he doesn't believe Israel [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1392.56s)]
*  has a right to exist. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1395.56s)]
*  He doesn't believe Israel has a right to exist. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1397.56s)]
*  Could you let me answer my question? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1400.56s)]
*  He doesn't believe that Israel has a right to exist. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1403.56s)]
*  Has he ever said that? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1406.56s)]
*  My question is this. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1408.56s)]
*  If Israel doesn't have the right to self-defence, then it doesn't have [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1410.56s)]
*  the right to exist. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1414.56s)]
*  If Israel doesn't have the right to self-defence, it doesn't have a [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1416.56s)]
*  right to exist. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1421.56s)]
*  He believes the whole of the country is a settlement. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1423.56s)]
*  He doesn't believe it. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1427.56s)]
*  You've said it, you've implied it. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1429.56s)]
*  If you let me answer the question. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1431.56s)]
*  Let me answer the question. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1433.56s)]
*  Where did I say Israel had no right to exist? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1436.56s)]
*  Show me. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1439.56s)]
*  I've written ten books on this subject. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1441.56s)]
*  I think you should answer him because you have said it as a fact. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1443.56s)]
*  If you believe that Israel doesn't have the right to self-defence, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1446.56s)]
*  you are basically saying that Israel doesn't have the right to exist. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1449.56s)]
*  No, I never... [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1452.56s)]
*  Yes, you do. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1454.56s)]
*  So then we can exist but we can't defend ourselves after people attack us. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1456.56s)]
*  You can't defend yourself against concentration camps. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1459.56s)]
*  He keeps interrupting me. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1462.56s)]
*  He's just had a ten-minute monologue. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1464.56s)]
*  I agree. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1466.56s)]
*  He's just had a ten-minute monologue. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1468.56s)]
*  Give me a five-minute monologue, okay? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1470.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1472.56s)]
*  Since the beginning of the establishment of the State of Israel, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1474.56s)]
*  which he believes that we were the terrible people, displacing people. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1476.56s)]
*  Okay, we were also displaced. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1479.56s)]
*  Jews were also displaced from Arab lands. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1481.56s)]
*  And that's just what happened post-war, post-colonization of the world. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1483.56s)]
*  So let's look. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1487.56s)]
*  In 47, there was a two-state solution proposed. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1489.56s)]
*  The Arabs said no. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1492.56s)]
*  It's not that they wanted a state. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1494.56s)]
*  It's that they didn't want the Jews to have a state. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1496.56s)]
*  So we declared a state in 48. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1498.56s)]
*  What happens? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1500.56s)]
*  All the countries around us come to attack to create a genocide. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1502.56s)]
*  It was a miracle that Israel wasn't eliminated in that moment. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1504.56s)]
*  Move forward. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1507.56s)]
*  67, those territories in which we were attacked, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1509.56s)]
*  there was no Palestine, there was no Palestinians. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1511.56s)]
*  It was Jordan and Egypt and Syria and Lebanon that attacked Israel. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1514.56s)]
*  If they would never have attacked Israel in 67, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1518.56s)]
*  that land would have remained Arab land. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1520.56s)]
*  Okay, fast forward 73. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1522.56s)]
*  Another war that we didn't start. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1524.56s)]
*  Now, do we not have the right to defend ourselves from destruction? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1526.56s)]
*  We started in 67. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1529.56s)]
*  We didn't start in 67. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1531.56s)]
*  We didn't start. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1533.56s)]
*  Then we go and we crumble onto hope. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1535.56s)]
*  We hold onto hope. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1537.56s)]
*  We say, let's do the Oslo Accords. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1539.56s)]
*  We offered Arafat, and Clinton will say this himself. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1541.56s)]
*  He has said that. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1543.56s)]
*  Everything they said they wanted. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1545.56s)]
*  7% of the West Bank, half of Jerusalem, the lot. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1547.56s)]
*  And they said no. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1551.56s)]
*  And they started a bloody intifada in the streets of my city [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1553.56s)]
*  that killed many, many innocent civilians, Jewish and Arab alike. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1555.56s)]
*  Then we thought, let's try something else. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1559.56s)]
*  In 2005, let's do a unilateral withdrawal. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1561.56s)]
*  That's what Sharon did. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1564.56s)]
*  He said, maybe if we actually just leave, they'll have an opportunity. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1566.56s)]
*  There was never a blockade. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1569.56s)]
*  The blockade started when Hamas went into power, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1571.56s)]
*  and they were bringing in, contrabanding missiles in which to attack Israel. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1573.56s)]
*  That's when a country has to say, we need to defend ourselves. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1578.56s)]
*  Now, if there's a blockade, don't they have a border with Egypt? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1583.56s)]
*  Why don't you say a word about Egypt? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1587.56s)]
*  There's no blockade when it's three walls. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1589.56s)]
*  Where's the fourth wall? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1591.56s)]
*  It's Egypt. What happened to Egypt? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1593.56s)]
*  Didn't they have tunnels going in and out of Egypt? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1595.56s)]
*  In fact, it was Egypt that had a much harsher border than Israel. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1597.56s)]
*  We had 20,000 people coming in to work. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1600.56s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1602.56s)]
*  So what concentration camp has... [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1603.56s)]
*  Tell me something. What concentration camp has a country club? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1605.56s)]
*  What concentration camp has a country club? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1608.56s)]
*  You should go ask Giora Ireland. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1610.56s)]
*  What concentration... [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1612.56s)]
*  Yes, Giora Ireland thinks we should keep northern Gaza. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1614.56s)]
*  That's what he thinks. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1617.56s)]
*  So now you're quoting him? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1618.56s)]
*  Why did Giora Ireland call it a huge concentration camp? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1620.56s)]
*  Why? 2004. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1623.56s)]
*  I don't speak for him. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1624.56s)]
*  Hey, you could just go for it. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1625.56s)]
*  2004. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1626.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1627.56s)]
*  We left in 2005. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1628.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1629.56s)]
*  We called Gaza in 2004 a huge concentration camp. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1630.56s)]
*  Let me ask you, Fleur. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1634.56s)]
*  So we left in 2004. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1635.56s)]
*  Fleur, let me ask you. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1636.56s)]
*  You never left. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1637.56s)]
*  Fleur, in your imagination you left. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1638.56s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1640.56s)]
*  Keep your distance, please. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1641.56s)]
*  In your imagination you left. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1642.56s)]
*  So you understand that this man... [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1643.56s)]
*  According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1645.56s)]
*  you didn't leave. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1647.56s)]
*  Yes, we know how neutral they are. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1648.56s)]
*  According to Human Rights Watch, you didn't leave. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1650.56s)]
*  We know how neutral they are. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1652.56s)]
*  According to Amnesty International. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1653.56s)]
*  We know how neutral. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1654.56s)]
*  I know. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1655.56s)]
*  Everybody's an anti-Semite. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1656.56s)]
*  No, but a lot of people. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1658.56s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1659.56s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1660.56s)]
*  I want to just answer something. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1661.56s)]
*  Let me... [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1662.56s)]
*  Let me just make... [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1663.56s)]
*  Let me just get a time-out. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1664.56s)]
*  Let me just make up. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1665.56s)]
*  No, I want to ask you a question, which is this. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1666.56s)]
*  There can be no doubt that even if Israel says we unilaterally [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1668.56s)]
*  pulled out in 2005 and withdrew troops and so on to the border, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1672.56s)]
*  whatever, there's no doubt that Israel continued to exercise a [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1676.56s)]
*  form of occupying control. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1681.56s)]
*  And we saw that very clearly after October the 7th when Israel was, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1683.56s)]
*  at the flick of a switch, able to turn off the supplies of water, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1687.56s)]
*  of electricity, of food. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1690.56s)]
*  Why didn't they develop their own water? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1691.56s)]
*  No, but here's my question for you, Flo. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1692.56s)]
*  Why didn't they use their money to develop their own electricity? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1693.56s)]
*  Here's my question for you. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1695.56s)]
*  Here's my question for you. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1696.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1697.56s)]
*  Here's my question for you. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1698.56s)]
*  Given that Israel had that power, you can dispute the word [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1699.56s)]
*  occupation, but they had a control over the people of Gaza, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1702.56s)]
*  the Palestinians, which I don't think they should have had. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1707.56s)]
*  What gives Israel the right to exercise that kind of power over [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1710.56s)]
*  the people of Gaza? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1714.56s)]
*  It wasn't over the people of Gaza. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1716.56s)]
*  It was a terrorist entity that has in its foundational charter the [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1717.56s)]
*  destruction of the whole of Israel. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1722.56s)]
*  You gave them control. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1724.56s)]
*  At least not the agreement. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1725.56s)]
*  We gave the Palestinian Authority control. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1727.56s)]
*  Are you saying all Gazans are Hamas? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1730.56s)]
*  No, we gave the Palestinian Authority control and then the year [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1732.56s)]
*  later they had elections pushed by the American government at the [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1735.56s)]
*  time and then Hamas won that election and then took over in a [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1739.56s)]
*  brutal coup, which by the way, do you know how many of the PA they [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1743.56s)]
*  killed? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1746.56s)]
*  This is their own civil war going on. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1747.56s)]
*  That's also Israel's fault. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1749.56s)]
*  Everything is Israel's fault. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1751.56s)]
*  You are basically practicing the bigotry of low expectation for the [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1753.56s)]
*  Gazans and the Palestinians. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1757.56s)]
*  He's saying that the Palestinian leadership has no responsibility. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1759.56s)]
*  Zero responsibility. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1763.56s)]
*  Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1765.56s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1768.56s)]
*  So that explains why Israel prohibited chocolate from entering Gaza. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1769.56s)]
*  That's why Israel prohibited baby chicks from Gaza. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1775.56s)]
*  I don't agree with any of this. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1779.56s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1781.56s)]
*  He's twisting the reality. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1783.56s)]
*  That is a reality. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1785.56s)]
*  Israel was doing that. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1786.56s)]
*  They were restricting building materials that they knew they were [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1788.56s)]
*  using. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1792.56s)]
*  It wasn't all they were restricting. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1793.56s)]
*  Listen, I want to bring things forward. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1795.56s)]
*  We finally agree on more than we disagree. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1797.56s)]
*  You'd be surprised. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1800.56s)]
*  I have a lot of sympathy for the plight of the Palestinians. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1802.56s)]
*  I have sympathy for Israel. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1805.56s)]
*  I have a lot of sympathy for the Palestinians. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1807.56s)]
*  They have always had terrible leadership. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1809.56s)]
*  You know what I think? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1811.56s)]
*  Palestinians should be entitled to the exact same human rights as you. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1813.56s)]
*  They should be entitled to their own self-determination. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1816.56s)]
*  Why didn't they do that? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1819.56s)]
*  Why didn't they take one of the pieces? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1821.56s)]
*  I agree. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1823.56s)]
*  Do you know why? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1825.56s)]
*  Do you know why, Piers? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1827.56s)]
*  Because they have never taken responsibility. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1829.56s)]
*  The whole world has taken all responsibility away from the leadership. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1832.56s)]
*  My view is a bigger view, which is that right behind all this is Iran. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1837.56s)]
*  Iran's tentacles have been fuelling Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1841.56s)]
*  That is the core problem in the region. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1845.56s)]
*  In Norman Finkelstein's world, Islamism is not a problem. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1847.56s)]
*  Let Norman respond now. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1850.56s)]
*  In his world, that is not a problem. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1852.56s)]
*  It is a very simple answer. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1854.56s)]
*  There are four or five final status questions bearing on resolving the conflict. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1856.56s)]
*  Jerusalem, settlements, borders, refugees. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1862.56s)]
*  Those are the main issues. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1867.56s)]
*  Under international law, the settlements are illegal. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1869.56s)]
*  Each and every one. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1873.56s)]
*  I noticed yesterday when I was watching your latest programme, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1875.56s)]
*  you referred to the building of new settlements as being appalling. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1878.56s)]
*  No, under international law, confirmed in the July decision [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1883.56s)]
*  of the International Court of Justice, all the settlements are illegal. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1887.56s)]
*  Under the plans that Ehud Barak offered in the year 2000 [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1892.56s)]
*  and then later under Ehud Omar, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1899.56s)]
*  Israel wanted to keep 80% of the settlements in place. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1903.56s)]
*  It wanted to keep all the settlement blocks in place. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1908.56s)]
*  The question of borders, Israel's position has been, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1913.56s)]
*  excuse me, it will not return to the June 1967 border. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1918.56s)]
*  That's in breach of international law. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1923.56s)]
*  Israel says it will not leave East Jerusalem. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1926.56s)]
*  East Jerusalem is occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1931.56s)]
*  It belongs to the Palestinian people. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1936.56s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1939.56s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1941.56s)]
*  I hope everybody will listen. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1943.56s)]
*  Who are we occupying Jerusalem from? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1945.56s)]
*  It was Jordanian before 1967. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1947.56s)]
*  No, you're talking about law. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1949.56s)]
*  You're wrong in law. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1951.56s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1953.56s)]
*  It's never been Palestinian. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1955.56s)]
*  On one point, we can argue about the history of the settlements. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1957.56s)]
*  What I don't think anyone can argue, Israeli or Palestinian, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1963.56s)]
*  since the start of this war on October 7th, 8th, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1968.56s)]
*  is that the aggressive expansion of settlements on the West Bank [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1972.56s)]
*  by Israelis since the start of this war, in my estimation, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1977.56s)]
*  has not just been outrageous, I think it actually constitutes [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1981.56s)]
*  an indisputable war crime. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1985.56s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1987.56s)]
*  Have you ever read Oslo? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1989.56s)]
*  I'm very aware of it. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1991.56s)]
*  I've actually interviewed... [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1993.56s)]
*  Why are you assuming things? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1995.56s)]
*  I'm asking you a question because when you talk about it, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=1997.56s)]
*  you don't understand what was actually... [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2000.56s)]
*  I think he understood. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2002.56s)]
*  I've literally specifically asked you about the aggressive [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2004.56s)]
*  expansion of settlements since October 7th. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2007.56s)]
*  It is indefensible, it is illegal and in my estimation, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2010.56s)]
*  it is a war crime. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2013.56s)]
*  Now, we know that's happening because we can see it. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2015.56s)]
*  There's no war crime, there's no occupation. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2018.56s)]
*  What we can't see in Gaza is anything because the journalists [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2020.56s)]
*  aren't allowed in. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2023.56s)]
*  If the journalists were allowed in and they got killed, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2025.56s)]
*  you'd say Israel's killing journalists. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2028.56s)]
*  So you can't win, can you? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2030.56s)]
*  What do you think of the aggressive expansion of settlements [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2032.56s)]
*  in Gaza? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2035.56s)]
*  I'll take the premise of that and I'll tell you why. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2037.56s)]
*  Do you think it's fine? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2040.56s)]
*  Do you support the expansion? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2042.56s)]
*  I've had Jewish guests who have condemned it. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2044.56s)]
*  She said there's no occupation. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2046.56s)]
*  Do you think these expansions are fine? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2048.56s)]
*  I want to answer the question. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2050.56s)]
*  Are they justified? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2052.56s)]
*  Oslo split... [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2054.56s)]
*  I'm not interested in Oslo. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2056.56s)]
*  The whole premise of the question... [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2058.56s)]
*  Has the expansion of settlements in the West Bank [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2060.56s)]
*  been justified? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2063.56s)]
*  94% of Palestinians are living under their own autonomy [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2065.56s)]
*  in Judea and Samaria. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2068.56s)]
*  Is it justified? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2070.56s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2072.56s)]
*  Of course we're justified. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2074.56s)]
*  We are building communities. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2076.56s)]
*  You're forcing people out of their homes illegally. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2078.56s)]
*  International law says you're breaking the law. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2081.56s)]
*  There's no homes, there's desert. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2084.56s)]
*  There's the Judean desert where there's settlements. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2086.56s)]
*  Let me come back to Norman. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2089.56s)]
*  You think people are getting kicked out of their homes? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2091.56s)]
*  Here's my thing for you. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2094.56s)]
*  You're probably going to like me saying this. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2096.56s)]
*  I've had guests from the Israeli side [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2098.56s)]
*  and when I've had that very point, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2100.56s)]
*  they have very quickly said I think it's wrong. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2102.56s)]
*  I respect that completely. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2105.56s)]
*  I've got to say, Fleur, your total refusal to accept anything [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2107.56s)]
*  in terms of the settlements since October 7th is wrong. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2110.56s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2113.56s)]
*  Why was there terrorism before 1967? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2115.56s)]
*  I'm not going back to 1967. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2117.56s)]
*  You're talking about territory that was legitimately conquered [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2119.56s)]
*  after a war we didn't start in 1967. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2123.56s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2125.56s)]
*  Do you think that when somebody aggressively starts a war, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2127.56s)]
*  they should never pay a price for that? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2130.56s)]
*  No, but I think you should be honest about what the price... [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2132.56s)]
*  They should never pay a price? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2135.56s)]
*  No, of course they should. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2137.56s)]
*  What's the price they should pay? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2139.56s)]
*  That's the question I've been asking for the last year. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2141.56s)]
*  Jordan attacked Israel. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2144.56s)]
*  Jordan attacked Israel. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2146.56s)]
*  That's the question I've been asking for the last year. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2148.56s)]
*  The territory was Jordanian. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2150.56s)]
*  After the war, they said, keep them. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2152.56s)]
*  Fine, I'm going to Norman for a response. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2154.56s)]
*  Here's the thing, Norman. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2156.56s)]
*  We agree about more than you may realise, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2158.56s)]
*  and I do with you as well in certain areas, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2160.56s)]
*  and disagree in others, right? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2162.56s)]
*  So I don't come at this from an ideological, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2164.56s)]
*  I'm with one side or the other, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2166.56s)]
*  but I do find anyone who attempts to defend [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2168.56s)]
*  the expansion of settlements in the way that we've seen, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2170.56s)]
*  and I think they're so far one-sided, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2173.56s)]
*  they can't see the wood for the trees out there. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2175.56s)]
*  My big issue with Gaza is not that your characterisation [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2177.56s)]
*  is necessarily wrong, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2181.56s)]
*  it's that we as Western media don't know, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2183.56s)]
*  because we're not allowed in there. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2186.56s)]
*  And my big, big problem with the IDF, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2188.56s)]
*  and I'll get a response from you, Fleur, on this, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2190.56s)]
*  is the IDF's refusal to let independent Western journalists in [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2192.56s)]
*  to verify what they're doing and to report fairly and freely, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2196.56s)]
*  I think is very telling and increasingly damning. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2200.56s)]
*  OK, Piers, I listened to you yesterday, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2203.56s)]
*  yesterday's programme, when you had Katie Halperage [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2206.56s)]
*  and Alan Dershowitzens and John Kornikis and Matt Kennard, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2209.56s)]
*  and that point you made yesterday, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2214.56s)]
*  which you're reiterating today, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2216.56s)]
*  I'd like to address it very directly. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2218.56s)]
*  You say the problem is that Israel is, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2220.56s)]
*  or a problem is, that Israel isn't admitting journalists, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2223.56s)]
*  and you correctly said it's fair for a fair-minded person [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2226.56s)]
*  to infer from that fact. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2230.56s)]
*  Yes, so they're hiding something. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2233.56s)]
*  They're hiding something. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2234.56s)]
*  No question. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2236.56s)]
*  But that's only half the picture. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2237.56s)]
*  The other half of the picture, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2239.56s)]
*  which I hope your listeners will pay attention to, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2241.56s)]
*  the other half of the picture is this. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2243.56s)]
*  Since Israel imposed the blockade on Gaza, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2246.56s)]
*  it's been a basket case, an economic basket case, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2248.56s)]
*  and all these international organisations have had to come in [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2252.56s)]
*  Save the Children, World Food Programme, CARE, UNESCO, UNICEF. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2255.56s)]
*  They all have field operations there. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2261.56s)]
*  They all know the lay of the land. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2264.56s)]
*  They're all still there since October 7th. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2267.56s)]
*  Now, when South Africa submitted its application [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2271.56s)]
*  to the International Court of Justice, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2275.56s)]
*  alleging that Israel was in breach of the genocide convention, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2278.56s)]
*  who did it cite? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2282.56s)]
*  It cited all of these organisations. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2284.56s)]
*  It would be better if we had journalists there, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2288.56s)]
*  but really at this point, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2292.56s)]
*  journalistic coverage would be superfluous. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2294.56s)]
*  We have all the respected... [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2298.56s)]
*  There's never superfluous. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2300.56s)]
*  OK, I will say superfluous meaning [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2301.56s)]
*  we have all of these international respected organisations, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2304.56s)]
*  many of them headed by Americans, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2309.56s)]
*  like Agency for International Development. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2312.56s)]
*  I get your point. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2314.56s)]
*  When they charge, when they all charge, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2316.56s)]
*  when they all charge that Israel is using starvation... [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2319.56s)]
*  I get your point. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2322.56s)]
*  We're running low on time. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2323.56s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2324.56s)]
*  I just want to respond to that a second. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2325.56s)]
*  Israel is using starvation as a weapon. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2327.56s)]
*  We have about eight minutes left. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2329.56s)]
*  I just want to answer that. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2330.56s)]
*  The special advisor for prevention of genocide yesterday for the UN [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2331.56s)]
*  was sacked. Why? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2335.56s)]
*  Because she said that what's happening in Gaza [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2336.56s)]
*  did not meet the definition of genocide. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2338.56s)]
*  This is the special advisor for prevention of genocide. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2341.56s)]
*  What he is talking about is a blood libel [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2344.56s)]
*  that Jews have suffered for thousands of years. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2347.56s)]
*  And what's happening today, that the little blood libel, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2350.56s)]
*  they used to be, oh, Jews are killing Christian children [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2353.56s)]
*  for making the bread, and all of that today, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2356.56s)]
*  as the collective country, the Jewish country, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2359.56s)]
*  now today we face the same blood libel, but in big. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2362.56s)]
*  That's exactly what's happening. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2365.56s)]
*  Listen, we have a few minutes... [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2366.56s)]
*  Genocide is a blood libel. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2368.56s)]
*  Flair. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2369.56s)]
*  Apartheid is a blood libel. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2370.56s)]
*  Everything this man talks about is a blood libel. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2371.56s)]
*  You made your point. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2373.56s)]
*  I want to ask... [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2374.56s)]
*  And he's having his five minutes in the sun [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2375.56s)]
*  because today it's trending to hate Israel and hate Jews. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2377.56s)]
*  But it'll be over because we've survived worse than this. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2381.56s)]
*  I want to interrupt you. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2384.56s)]
*  I want to ask, Norman, just about Donald Trump. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2385.56s)]
*  He's the new president of the United States. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2388.56s)]
*  He's packed his cabinet with very pro-Israeli people. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2390.56s)]
*  That's no great secret. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2393.56s)]
*  He makes no secret of being very pro-Israeli. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2394.56s)]
*  What does that mean, do you think, for this war? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2397.56s)]
*  I mean, on one level, it may bring an end to the war faster, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2399.56s)]
*  which would be a good thing for everybody. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2402.56s)]
*  But what does it mean going forward? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2404.56s)]
*  I mean, my big argument with Israel, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2406.56s)]
*  I've seen no coherent plan for life after the war. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2408.56s)]
*  And I've been very cynical about Netanyahu, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2412.56s)]
*  that he's facing corruption charges the moment this is over. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2415.56s)]
*  He's also, there's a big report out today from Israel [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2418.56s)]
*  holding his government to account for the failures [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2420.56s)]
*  of allowing October 7th to happen on their watch. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2423.56s)]
*  There'll be accountability for that. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2425.56s)]
*  There's no great incentive for him to end this, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2427.56s)]
*  but Trump may want him to end it quickly, I suspect. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2429.56s)]
*  But what happens then? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2432.56s)]
*  I mean, just to be big picture here, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2433.56s)]
*  what is going to happen, do you think? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2435.56s)]
*  Well, I hate to be a bearer of bad news. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2437.56s)]
*  And I've been criticised on that score by people [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2440.56s)]
*  who normally I would count as my allies. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2445.56s)]
*  But as I said, I think Gaza is no more. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2448.56s)]
*  It's gone. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2451.56s)]
*  What will happen to the people? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2452.56s)]
*  I think by hook or by crook, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2454.56s)]
*  they're going to have to figure out a way to leave. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2456.56s)]
*  Will they go into neighbouring Arab countries? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2458.56s)]
*  Oh, they won't accept them. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2460.56s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2462.56s)]
*  Nobody's accepting them. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2464.56s)]
*  As you know, peers, in the modern world, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2465.56s)]
*  right now there are 2.5 million Syrians in Turkey. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2467.56s)]
*  There are about 1.5 million Syrians in Lebanon. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2471.56s)]
*  There are large population movements. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2474.56s)]
*  I don't want to go into that area, first of all, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2477.56s)]
*  because it's speculative. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2479.56s)]
*  And second of all, it seems to me it's a distraction [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2481.56s)]
*  from what we should be focusing on now. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2484.56s)]
*  And what we should be focusing on now is what happened, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2486.56s)]
*  who is accountable for it, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2490.56s)]
*  because that's one part of historical justice. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2492.56s)]
*  Before I go to Fleur for a response, just very quickly, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2495.56s)]
*  because we are literally into the last five minutes now, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2497.56s)]
*  should Hamas have any form of power in any government after this war? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2499.56s)]
*  Piers, I've answered that question to you before, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2506.56s)]
*  but I'll answer it again. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2509.56s)]
*  I will be succinct. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2511.56s)]
*  If Hamas, by killing 1,200 people on October 7th, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2513.56s)]
*  disqualified itself from participating in any future [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2518.56s)]
*  in the resolution of the conflict, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2523.56s)]
*  then Israel, by a factor of maybe 20 times more, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2526.56s)]
*  has disqualified itself. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2529.56s)]
*  And we have to add, it's not just the state of Israel. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2532.56s)]
*  It's the entire population of Israel, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2537.56s)]
*  which gets more and more enthusiastic [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2541.56s)]
*  and relishes more and more each time a massacre unfolds in Gaza. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2545.56s)]
*  Hang on, on that, we also saw scenes of widespread jubilation [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2551.56s)]
*  when the hostages were dragged through the streets in Gaza [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2557.56s)]
*  from a lot of Palestinians. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2561.56s)]
*  The idea that it's just Hamas members who have a view [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2563.56s)]
*  of an anti-Jewish sentiment. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2567.56s)]
*  We saw it with our own eyes. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2569.56s)]
*  He is assigning a cult of death to the wrong side. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2571.56s)]
*  He is assigning a cult of death to Israel. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2575.56s)]
*  Israel is a cult of life. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2577.56s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2579.56s)]
*  I have four children. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2581.56s)]
*  I have four children and they come home singing songs, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2583.56s)]
*  one day we'll have peace. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2586.56s)]
*  You know what they teach you in the Palestinian... [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2588.56s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2590.56s)]
*  The very root is not let me answer any question. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2592.56s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2595.56s)]
*  You do not live in Israel. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2597.56s)]
*  You have not been to Israel. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2599.56s)]
*  And I don't know how long. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2601.56s)]
*  They sing death to the Arabs. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2603.56s)]
*  Even in Amsterdam, they sing death to the Arabs. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2605.56s)]
*  In fact, even in Amsterdam, they sang, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2607.56s)]
*  you know why there are no more schools in Gaza? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2610.56s)]
*  Because there are no more children in Gaza. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2612.56s)]
*  He is justifying the pogrom. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2615.56s)]
*  He is justifying the pogrom. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2617.56s)]
*  The abuse wife syndrome. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2619.56s)]
*  Justifying the pogrom. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2621.56s)]
*  Israel has a cult of life for Jews. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2623.56s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2626.56s)]
*  And the 20% of Arabs who live... [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2628.56s)]
*  And death to all the Arabs. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2630.56s)]
*  And 20% of Arab citizens that live in peace in Israel, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2632.56s)]
*  that prosper in Israel, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2634.56s)]
*  that are in every single strata of society in Israel. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2636.56s)]
*  You know who the best educated people in Israel are? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2639.56s)]
*  Christian Arab women. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2642.56s)]
*  That's Israel. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2644.56s)]
*  We celebrate diversity. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2645.56s)]
*  Everybody gets opportunities, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2647.56s)]
*  including our Muslim, our Druze, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2649.56s)]
*  and our Christian population. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2651.56s)]
*  He is living in a world that doesn't exist [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2653.56s)]
*  and is assigning everything that is wrong with Hamas to... [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2655.56s)]
*  Now, let me just finish with something. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2658.56s)]
*  This is Israel Chania, who we killed, thankfully. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2660.56s)]
*  A billionaire. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2664.56s)]
*  The guy who obviously followed the accounting of Hamas, yes. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2666.56s)]
*  The blood of women, children, and elderly. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2669.56s)]
*  We are the ones that need this blood. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2671.56s)]
*  And he is the one who has taken within us the revolutionary spirit. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2673.56s)]
*  This is the guy who stole billions from his own people [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2677.56s)]
*  and lived like a king in Doha. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2679.56s)]
*  Now, I think what both of you get wrong [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2681.56s)]
*  is that this is not a territorial conflict. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2683.56s)]
*  This is an ideological conflict [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2687.56s)]
*  because Hamas don't want a two-state solution. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2689.56s)]
*  And unfortunately, the PA have rejected [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2691.56s)]
*  every two-state solution proposed to them from 1947. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2694.56s)]
*  So what happens at the end of the war? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2697.56s)]
*  There is no territorial solution [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2699.56s)]
*  to this conflict. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2701.56s)]
*  I pray that the Abraham Accords [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2703.56s)]
*  and that the wider peace in the region [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2705.56s)]
*  will bring the Palestinians to the point [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2707.56s)]
*  that they understand that the only way forward [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2709.56s)]
*  is to negotiate with Israel. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2711.56s)]
*  Not to go this way or that way, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2714.56s)]
*  and not to kill Israelis, but to negotiate with Israel. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2716.56s)]
*  Israel is a country that I'm so proud of, my country. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2719.56s)]
*  1948, nobody gave us anything. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2722.56s)]
*  We've been fighting wars in Settledi. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2724.56s)]
*  We've built a technological superpower. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2726.56s)]
*  We are curing cancer. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2728.56s)]
*  We are curing climate issues. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2730.56s)]
*  You know what we need a cure for? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2732.56s)]
*  We are doing what we have more noble prizes per capita [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2734.56s)]
*  than anybody else, including Arab Israelis [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2737.56s)]
*  who prosper in this country. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2739.56s)]
*  You know what we need a cure for? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2741.56s)]
*  Killing Arab children. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2743.56s)]
*  No, we need a cure for a 75-year conflict. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2745.56s)]
*  We do. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2747.56s)]
*  I pray for that cure every day. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2749.56s)]
*  I'm reminded again of a conflict in Northern Ireland [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2751.56s)]
*  between implacable enemies [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2753.56s)]
*  who killed each other for many decades. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2755.56s)]
*  And they eventually got leaders [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2757.56s)]
*  who were able to barrel through all that [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2759.56s)]
*  and reach peace. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2761.56s)]
*  And that's what we need. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2763.56s)]
*  I was deputy mayor of Jerusalem for six years. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2765.56s)]
*  All I did was build bridges between the 40% Muslim population [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2767.56s)]
*  and the Jewish population. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2770.56s)]
*  I've got to leave it there. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2772.56s)]
*  Fleur and Norman, thank you. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2774.56s)]
*  I appreciate you coming together. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2776.56s)]
*  I know it's passionate views on both sides, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2778.56s)]
*  but I do appreciate you agreeing to do this debate. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2780.56s)]
*  I always learn things when smart people debate these things. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2782.56s)]
*  Just one last word, if you don't mind. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2785.56s)]
*  OK. I was supposed to debate Benny Morris at Oxford. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2787.56s)]
*  He said he won't debate me. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2791.56s)]
*  I was then supposed to debate Ehud Omar at Oxford. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2793.56s)]
*  This week, that's why I came. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2796.56s)]
*  He said he wouldn't debate me, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2798.56s)]
*  so I appreciate the fact that Fleur came. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2800.56s)]
*  I don't think she fared very well. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2803.56s)]
*  OK. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2805.56s)]
*  Well, that's true, but let me tell you... [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2807.56s)]
*  You know what? No, no, I'm done. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2809.56s)]
*  He refuses to debate Mossad Youssef Hassan. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2811.56s)]
*  You know what? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2813.56s)]
*  You agree to debate him. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowl3uFfDzc&t=2815.56s)]
