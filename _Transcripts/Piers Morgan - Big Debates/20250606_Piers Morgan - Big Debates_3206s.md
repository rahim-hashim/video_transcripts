# “You’re NOT a Serious Person!” Uncensored Christians Take On Jubilee Atheists!
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k)
*  You're a Christian. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=0.0s)]
*  You say that? I haven't claimed that. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3.0s)]
*  Oh, what is this? Is this a Christians versus atheists? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=5.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=8.0s)]
*  You don't know where you are right now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=9.0s)]
*  Don't be a smart ass. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=10.0s)]
*  Well, either you're a Christian or you're not. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=11.0s)]
*  Because I won't talk to you if you're a smart ass. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=13.0s)]
*  Oh, either you're a Christian or you're not. Which one is it? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=15.0s)]
*  Danny, you are the smart ass in the room, according to Jordan. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=17.0s)]
*  People can see the frustration that we have with Peterson. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=21.0s)]
*  I would say that atheists are not the only ones that are frustrated. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=23.0s)]
*  Christians are. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=26.0s)]
*  We have two gay theists on the panel that have said that I've bullied them. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=27.0s)]
*  See, like, this kind of behavior. Look at this behavior. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=30.0s)]
*  It's called a joke, sensitive man. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=32.0s)]
*  They're funny, David. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=33.0s)]
*  Oh my God, look at this behavior. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=34.0s)]
*  This behavior is out of control. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=36.0s)]
*  Well, you are two gay theists. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=37.0s)]
*  It's too much behavior. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=38.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=39.0s)]
*  I thought we were supposed to be loving to thy neighbor. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=40.0s)]
*  You don't know what loving means. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=42.0s)]
*  You don't know what that means. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=44.0s)]
*  Let's not talk over each other. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=45.0s)]
*  When 20 committed atheists recently took on Professor Jordan Peterson [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=49.0s)]
*  as part of Jubilee's Surrounded series, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=52.0s)]
*  it's fair to say it got quite intense, especially for Dr. Peterson. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=55.0s)]
*  Two exchanges in particular took the internet by storm. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=58.0s)]
*  So do you believe in the all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good notion of God? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=62.0s)]
*  What do you mean by believe? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=65.0s)]
*  Do you think it to be true? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=67.0s)]
*  That's the circular definition. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=69.0s)]
*  What do you mean when you say you believe? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=71.0s)]
*  How is that circular? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=73.0s)]
*  Because you added no content to the answer by substituting the word true and believe. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=75.0s)]
*  I said you think it to be true. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=82.0s)]
*  You're a Christian. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=83.0s)]
*  You say that? I haven't claimed that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=84.0s)]
*  What is this? Is this Christians versus atheists? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=87.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=89.0s)]
*  You don't know where you are right now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=91.0s)]
*  Don't be a smartass. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=92.0s)]
*  Either you're a Christian or you're not. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=93.0s)]
*  I won't talk to you if you're a smartass. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=95.0s)]
*  Either you're a Christian or you're not. Which one is it? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=97.0s)]
*  So you're saying that you don't believe something if you wouldn't die for it? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=99.0s)]
*  Not really, no. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=102.0s)]
*  How would you define belief? Something you say? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=104.0s)]
*  I could believe it is the case that this pen exists, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=107.0s)]
*  but if someone threatened my life, I would lie in order to be able to save my life. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=110.0s)]
*  I think you would do that too. You wouldn't lie to save your life? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=115.0s)]
*  Don't be so sure. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=118.0s)]
*  You wouldn't lie to save your life? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=119.0s)]
*  I think everyone should look at the title of the YouTube channel. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=121.0s)]
*  You're probably in the wrong YouTube video. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=124.0s)]
*  You're really quite something. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=126.0s)]
*  Aren't I? But you're really quite nothing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=127.0s)]
*  You're not a Christian. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=129.0s)]
*  Okay, I'm done with him. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=130.0s)]
*  Well now, in the wake of that video, one of Peterson's young inquisitors posted on X. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=132.0s)]
*  Peterson was no Christian. Let's move on. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=138.0s)]
*  Are there any actual Christians that want to debate? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=141.0s)]
*  Which is quite the challenge. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=144.0s)]
*  But one that of course we on Uncensored are only too keen to facilitate. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=146.0s)]
*  So making their Uncensored debut from the Danny Field Talk channel, Danny Shaw, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=150.0s)]
*  and Parker from the Parker Get a Job channel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=154.0s)]
*  And we've arranged for them to take on two of the most notorious and fearsome debaters on the internet, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=157.0s)]
*  who also happen to be conservative Christians. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=161.0s)]
*  The king of blood sport debating, Andrew Wilson from The Crucible, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=164.0s)]
*  and the equally forthright author, comedian, and commentator, Jay Dyer from the Jay Dyer channel. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=168.0s)]
*  Welcome to all four of you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=173.0s)]
*  Well, let me start with you, Parker. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=175.0s)]
*  Were you surprised by the reaction to what went down with Jordan Peterson? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=178.0s)]
*  Actually, no. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=184.0s)]
*  I was actually expecting this to happen as I knew before this, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=186.0s)]
*  as I watched the Alex O'Connor debate against Jordan Peterson, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=189.0s)]
*  that he was very, very not likely to, you know, like being associated with Christianity. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=192.0s)]
*  So I knew actually going into this that I was going to ask him a question specifically [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=197.0s)]
*  about whether or not he believes this to be the case, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=201.0s)]
*  and that he would likely be not very upfront with his answer. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=203.0s)]
*  So I actually kind of expected there to be a response like this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=207.0s)]
*  Now, I didn't expect it to go as viral as it did, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=210.0s)]
*  as there are literally tens of millions of views on clips associated with mine [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=212.0s)]
*  and Danny's against Jordan Peterson all over social media. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=216.0s)]
*  So it's actually really cool to see that, you know, everyone across the board, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=219.0s)]
*  whether they be Christians, atheists, Muslims, right, et cetera, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=222.0s)]
*  actually see that like he's really not wanting to answer the question there [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=225.0s)]
*  because he doesn't want to be associated with Christianity for some reason. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=228.0s)]
*  And Danny, I mean, you were the smart-ass in the room, according to Jordan. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=231.0s)]
*  What's been your reaction to the fallout? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=236.0s)]
*  I'm generally happy that people can see the frustration that we have with Peterson. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=240.0s)]
*  I would say that atheists are not the only ones that are frustrated. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=246.0s)]
*  Christians are, right? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=249.0s)]
*  Here we have Peterson saying things like, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=250.0s)]
*  yeah, I think Jesus might have resurrected, but I don't know what that means. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=252.0s)]
*  Yeah, I might be a Christian in some sense. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=255.0s)]
*  I'm a one-of-a-kind Christian. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=257.0s)]
*  It's all wishy-washy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=259.0s)]
*  We're all frustrated, and I think that the video is the culmination of that frustration. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=261.0s)]
*  OK, well, the good news, like I told you, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=265.0s)]
*  is we've found two far-from-shy Christians to take you on in this arena. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=267.0s)]
*  Andrew Wilson, let me start with you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=273.0s)]
*  What was your reaction to these two and their showdown with Jordan Peterson? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=275.0s)]
*  I mean, I kind of have to agree with Danny a little bit. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=280.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, people have been wanting this guy to take the position [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=284.0s)]
*  on whether he's a Christian or not a Christian forever, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=289.0s)]
*  on the right, the left, center, basically across the board. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=292.0s)]
*  Now, I'll always be in some ways grateful to Jordan Peterson. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=296.0s)]
*  He was one of the first who kind of started the trend of standing up to the pronouns people, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=299.0s)]
*  which was pretty epic to watch. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=304.0s)]
*  But, you know, ultimately, you know, he's kind of a shell of his former self. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=306.0s)]
*  He didn't look great going through that debate. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=311.0s)]
*  He looked kind of run down. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=313.0s)]
*  I think that him being on with the Daily Wire probably hasn't been great for him. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=315.0s)]
*  He doesn't have the kind of edge that he used to have. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=319.0s)]
*  But ultimately, I mean, I was actually kind of glad to see it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=323.0s)]
*  You know, it's about time we know, are you or aren't you? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=327.0s)]
*  You know, get off the shit or get off the pod, essentially, right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=330.0s)]
*  Are you a Christian or aren't you a Christian? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=333.0s)]
*  That's a fair question. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=335.0s)]
*  And, Jay, I mean, ultimately, these two young men on the panel today, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=337.0s)]
*  they're sworn atheists. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=342.0s)]
*  You obviously are not. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=345.0s)]
*  So if you were actually conducting a debate about their atheism against your Christianity, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=347.0s)]
*  how would you take them on given what happened to Jordan? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=352.0s)]
*  Well, it depends on what you mean, Pierce. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=355.0s)]
*  Depends on what you mean. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=358.0s)]
*  You know, how would I take them on? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=361.0s)]
*  Well, I think there's a lot of different ways that you could critique an atheist position. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=364.0s)]
*  Most of the time, I argue from the three branches of philosophy, epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=370.0s)]
*  Those are just the three branches of any worldview, and everybody has a worldview, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=376.0s)]
*  whether they know it consciously or not. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=380.0s)]
*  So I would critique the foundations of the atheist materialist worldview to see if it's rational, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=383.0s)]
*  if it's coherent, if it can provide a justification for knowledge or ethical aughts. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=389.0s)]
*  So I think that would have been a much better route. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=395.0s)]
*  In fact, Peterson used to kind of take that approach. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=397.0s)]
*  Back when he debated Sam Harris, he would call out the is aught problem with Sam Harris. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=399.0s)]
*  When he debated Matt Dillahunty, he would call out the exact same types of preconditions [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=405.0s)]
*  for a worldview issue that I used to do, or I usually do. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=410.0s)]
*  So I think that'd be a better route than just sort of having this ambiguous, you know, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=413.0s)]
*  Jungian position of noncommittal, whatever it is. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=419.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I would say to you, Parker and Danny, that I've interviewed Jordan Peterson a lot, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=423.0s)]
*  maybe five or six times on Uncensored. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=427.0s)]
*  Quite long interviews, often quite emotional. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=430.0s)]
*  He's an emotional guy. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=432.0s)]
*  I would disagree with Andrew about him losing his edge. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=434.0s)]
*  I think he's still got the edge. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=437.0s)]
*  I also think that putting aside the whole debate about Christianity and whether he is or not, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=438.0s)]
*  he's always been oddly ambiguous about it to someone who's so unambiguous about everything else. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=443.0s)]
*  But that's his right. He's entitled to do that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=448.0s)]
*  As a force for good, though, for young men, I do think that in comparison, for example, to Andrew Tate, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=452.0s)]
*  that Jordan Peterson has been a far better influence over the minds of young men of your kind of age [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=460.0s)]
*  than someone like Andrew Tate would ever be. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=468.0s)]
*  Would you agree with that, Parker? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=471.0s)]
*  I actually would agree with that, although the bar is literally in hell. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=474.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, you must see some positives in the general messaging that Jordan gives for young men [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=479.0s)]
*  about wanting to improve their lives, wanting to empower themselves, opening up and so on. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=485.0s)]
*  Do you accept that about him? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=491.0s)]
*  I think it's good to open up, and I think it's good for men to want to improve their lives. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=494.0s)]
*  But we also need to be very specific on what is improving towards their lives. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=498.0s)]
*  And I honestly don't think that Jordan Peterson, within all respects, would be upholding that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=501.0s)]
*  But sure, I can say he's better than someone like Andrew Tate. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=507.0s)]
*  I think that's pretty obvious. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=510.0s)]
*  Danny, what's your view of Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson when it comes to their influence on young men? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=512.0s)]
*  Because it is huge. We're both of them. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=518.0s)]
*  I can tell you, when I walk around, most people under 25 who are male come up [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=520.0s)]
*  and they ask me either about Andrew Tate or Jordan Peterson. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=525.0s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like the question is like asking a Republican, is Joe Biden better than Mussolini? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=529.0s)]
*  I mean, it's such a vast difference. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=533.0s)]
*  I would say that it seems like that Jordan Peterson has benefited people, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=536.0s)]
*  mostly in the psychology realm, like the whole 12 Roots for Life and stuff, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=540.0s)]
*  which a lot of those rules seem to be rules that my grandma could tell me. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=544.0s)]
*  But granted, the point is that, yeah, he's probably helped people. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=548.0s)]
*  I have no problem saying that. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=552.0s)]
*  All right, Andrew, let's turn to some other issues here. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=554.0s)]
*  One is Pride Month. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=556.0s)]
*  Now, my view of this is I don't understand why we need a whole month for Pride. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=558.0s)]
*  I don't even get an hour as a straight guy. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=564.0s)]
*  So why do we need a month for Pride? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=566.0s)]
*  And it's not because I'm remotely homophobic, because I'm not. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=569.0s)]
*  I'm the complete opposite. I've always absolutely supported gay rights. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=573.0s)]
*  I just don't get why we need to have a month of Pride. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=577.0s)]
*  Beams Creatine is America's number one, and it's made by a company founded on values like hard work [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=582.0s)]
*  and delivering real results. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=588.0s)]
*  Creatine is often dismissed as just for bodybuilders, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=590.0s)]
*  but the truth is that it's one of the most researched, effective, and safer supplements [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=593.0s)]
*  for supporting strength, brain, brain health, and longevity. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=597.0s)]
*  Quality matters, of course, and Beam Creatine delivers. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=600.0s)]
*  There's no fillers, no sugar, and nothing synthetic. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=604.0s)]
*  Just clean, science-backed creatine for strength, focus, and results. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=607.0s)]
*  We've teamed up to give you up to 30% off their best-selling creatine for a limited time only. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=611.0s)]

*  Well, Pride's always been completely astroturfed. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=645.0s)]
*  I mean, to be honest, right from the very beginning, it's been astroturfed. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=648.0s)]
*  It was always pumped full of government money, NGO funding. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=652.0s)]
*  It was pumped full of corporate money. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=655.0s)]
*  There was an article that came out. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=657.0s)]
*  You can find it in the Drudge Report. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=658.0s)]
*  It came out today from, I believe it was Daily Telegram. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=659.0s)]
*  It was pretty interesting. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=662.0s)]
*  They went over a lot of the modern Trump administration, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=663.0s)]
*  what they have done with their executive orders. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=668.0s)]
*  A lot of companies have begun moving away from trying to kind of fund this, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=670.0s)]
*  and it hasn't been popular for the last couple of years anyway. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=674.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of pushback on various large corporations, companies, and NGOs [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=677.0s)]
*  for trying to pump kind of artificially these organizations. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=681.0s)]
*  One of the things that article points out, which I tend to agree with, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=685.0s)]
*  is that, hey, look, ultimately, when these companies are doing this, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=688.0s)]
*  people lose trust for them. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=694.0s)]
*  You remember there was a big thing with Target not that long ago. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=695.0s)]
*  Anytime this comes to light, there's actually a backlash. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=698.0s)]
*  People can kind of see that it's artificially held up. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=701.0s)]
*  There's no reason for it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=704.0s)]
*  It's silly. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=705.0s)]
*  It has never really been about gay rights. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=706.0s)]
*  What do you mean there's no reason for it? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=708.0s)]
*  Well, because it's always really been about... [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=710.0s)]
*  What do you mean there's no reason for it? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=713.0s)]
*  They're bullies like you. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=714.0s)]
*  Do you want me to answer the question or no? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=715.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can go ahead, and I'll explain to you why I think there's a reason after. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=718.0s)]
*  Okay, yeah, so there's no real reason for it. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=721.0s)]
*  It's been about pushing sexual perversion. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=725.0s)]
*  It's never really been about anything to do with homosexuals themselves [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=727.0s)]
*  not having rights or having rights. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=733.0s)]
*  It's never been about that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=735.0s)]
*  It's been about weird gay pride parades and all kinds of weird sexual stuff. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=736.0s)]
*  It really has never been about that. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=740.0s)]
*  And that's what the American people think. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=741.0s)]
*  That's what they see. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=743.0s)]
*  That's why you see companies moving away from it. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=744.0s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=746.0s)]
*  Look, gay people, people... [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=747.0s)]
*  Like, let's take you, for example. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=750.0s)]
*  You're the reason, right? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=751.0s)]
*  When I first talked to you, we were having a normal debate about, I think, morality. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=752.0s)]
*  And then you randomly asked me, are you a homosexual? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=757.0s)]
*  And you were, right? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=761.0s)]
*  And then, and then also with... [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=763.0s)]
*  Hang on, was I right, though? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=765.0s)]
*  Was I right? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=767.0s)]
*  I'm not homosexual. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=768.0s)]
*  No, I'm not married to a woman. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=769.0s)]
*  You said that you were bisexual. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=770.0s)]
*  You said that you were bisexual. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=771.0s)]
*  That's homosexual. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=772.0s)]
*  Homosexual is not the same as bisexual. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=773.0s)]
*  There's certain ways. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=774.0s)]
*  But look, there's certain ways that people conduct themselves. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=776.0s)]
*  People like you and Jay Dyer bully LGBTQ people. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=779.0s)]
*  That's why it's pride, because of the kind of stigmas that you promote. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=783.0s)]
*  Okay, so here's the thing that's so funny about this. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=787.0s)]
*  This is like, if both me and Jay Dyer, both of us assumed that you were a homosexual, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=790.0s)]
*  and both of us were right, that's what's so funny about it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=795.0s)]
*  We both assumed you were gay. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=798.0s)]
*  And we were both correct that you were gay. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=800.0s)]
*  Andrew, is there anything wrong with him being gay? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=802.0s)]
*  You go, Depar. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=804.0s)]
*  Is there anything wrong with him being gay? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=805.0s)]
*  There's a problem with you guys supporting the NGO-funded kind of astroturf program [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=807.0s)]
*  to promote rights which aren't even about promoting rights. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=813.0s)]
*  Was that a response to what you just said? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=816.0s)]
*  The whole ordeal here is, well, what's the prompt, Parker? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=818.0s)]
*  The prompt is about pride. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=822.0s)]
*  And so you're supporting an astroturfed, completely astroturfed NGO-funded thing. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=824.0s)]
*  It has nothing to do with gay rights at all. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=830.0s)]
*  And people don't like it, Parker. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=832.0s)]
*  They don't like it, Parker. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=833.0s)]
*  Well, Parker, I would ask you, I would ask Parker this. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=835.0s)]
*  Look, Andrew, you've said some things which I completely disagree with about this issue. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=838.0s)]
*  So women will never truly understand why men find homosexuality so depraved. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=842.0s)]
*  We don't think there's a problem there. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=848.0s)]
*  We know there's a problem there. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=850.0s)]
*  I'm a man. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=851.0s)]
*  I don't find homosexuality remotely depraved. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=852.0s)]
*  I think people's sexuality is what it is. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=856.0s)]
*  So I don't agree with you with some of the statements you've made. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=858.0s)]
*  However, Parker, I am increasingly bemused why when there are so many important things in the world to worry about, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=862.0s)]
*  we devote a whole month to gay pride. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=870.0s)]
*  Why do we? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=874.0s)]
*  There are plenty of things that we specifically have months for to celebrate that I think are incredibly important. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=876.0s)]
*  This, in this specific example, is incredibly important because of the dehumanization and the bigotry [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=881.0s)]
*  espoused specifically by people like Jay Dyer and Andrew Wilson [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=885.0s)]
*  and explicitly kicking people off of their panels because they're gay, right, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=888.0s)]
*  or because they're homosexual, which I think is incredibly ridiculous. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=891.0s)]
*  But you know as well as I do, Parker. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=894.0s)]
*  Can I please finish? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=896.0s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=897.0s)]
*  I'll say if you go back 35, 40 years, I would completely agree with you. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=898.0s)]
*  But the idea that that is still the case today, I just don't feel it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=902.0s)]
*  Do you mean certainly young people in particular do not? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=906.0s)]
*  It's just moved on respectfully. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=910.0s)]
*  How would you know as a straight person? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=912.0s)]
*  Like how would you do you experience? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=914.0s)]
*  Why are you assuming my sexuality? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=916.0s)]
*  I want to talk about peers. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=917.0s)]
*  I want to talk about my experience. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=918.0s)]
*  When I went viral, right, I had people message, you know, saying, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=920.0s)]
*  calling me the F slur, saying I had a gay lisp, right, when I'm married to a woman, right. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=924.0s)]
*  If I'm not even a homosexual and if people are bullying me for that, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=928.0s)]
*  I can't imagine what actual homosexuals have to go through. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=932.0s)]
*  So if you don't mind me asking, given it's now been sort of raised and I'm not quite sure, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=935.0s)]
*  are you straight? Are you bisexual? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=940.0s)]
*  I'm bisexual. I've been married to a woman happily for five years and we're monogamous. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=943.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=947.0s)]
*  Gay theists. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=948.0s)]
*  I want to chime in to we have two gay theists on the panel that have said that I've [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=949.0s)]
*  bullied them. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=953.0s)]
*  Look at this behavior. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=954.0s)]
*  That's called a joke. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=955.0s)]
*  That's called a joke. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=957.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=958.0s)]
*  Funny. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=959.0s)]
*  I'm a homophobic behavior. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=960.0s)]
*  That's behavior. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=961.0s)]
*  You are too gay. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=962.0s)]
*  It's too much. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=963.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=964.0s)]
*  Are you guys Christians? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=966.0s)]
*  I thought we're supposed to be loving to thy neighbor. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=967.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=969.0s)]
*  The only thing I can tell you when it's wrong. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=970.0s)]
*  Don't you love trans people, Parker? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=972.0s)]
*  You said that you would date a trans person. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=974.0s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=976.0s)]
*  What's wrong with that? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=977.0s)]
*  I think that you are more loving than me than Parker. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=978.0s)]
*  I wouldn't date a trans person. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=981.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=983.0s)]
*  Is that supposed to be like a critique of me? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=984.0s)]
*  The problem is that these guys can't give an account for the good. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=986.0s)]
*  I called for you as Christians to be loving. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=989.0s)]
*  All they've talked about is what's right and wrong. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=991.0s)]
*  You don't know what loving means. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=993.0s)]
*  You don't even know what that means. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=994.0s)]
*  Let's not talk over each other because no one can ever hear. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=995.0s)]
*  Jay? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=998.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=999.0s)]
*  So earlier in the first section, we talked about Peterson. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1000.0s)]
*  We were talking about what was good for men. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1002.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1004.0s)]
*  And whether Tate was good or Peterson was good. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1005.0s)]
*  And now we're talking about ethics in the sexual domain, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1007.0s)]
*  which there's no basis in the world for anything to be morally objective [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1011.0s)]
*  or right or wrong other than the personal preferences. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1016.0s)]
*  So if there's nothing objectively wrong, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1020.0s)]
*  there's no reason why bigotry is wrong. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1024.0s)]
*  Why is bigotry wrong? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1026.0s)]
*  Well, I want to support your claim. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1027.0s)]
*  Don't run from your claim. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1029.0s)]
*  Support it. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1030.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1031.0s)]
*  You're saying we as atheists have no basis of morality. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1032.0s)]
*  Support that. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1033.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1034.0s)]
*  No epistemic basis for getting an ought from an is. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1035.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1038.0s)]
*  That's a claim. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1039.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1040.0s)]
*  Well, you're saying atheists can't account for morality. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1041.0s)]
*  It's a famous argument. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1042.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1043.0s)]
*  You're saying that atheists can't account for morality. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1044.0s)]
*  So what's the argument for that? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1045.0s)]
*  You can't get an ought from an is is the argument. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1048.0s)]
*  Back to Hume. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1050.0s)]
*  It looks like you don't know what an argument is. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1051.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1053.0s)]
*  Reason. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1054.0s)]
*  Try to go from one line of reasoning to another. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1055.0s)]
*  Do you know what an argument is? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1057.0s)]
*  You cannot get an ought from an is. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1058.0s)]
*  You're an atheist in a materialistic worldview. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1060.0s)]
*  There's no ought. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1062.0s)]
*  What does that have to do with atheism? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1063.0s)]
*  In a materialistic, atheistic worldview, there are no oughts. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1064.0s)]
*  First of all, not a materialistic. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1068.0s)]
*  You don't know the basic problem of ought from an is. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1069.0s)]
*  And that's just another claim. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1070.0s)]
*  That's just another claim. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1071.0s)]
*  It's not a claim. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1072.0s)]
*  It's an argument. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1073.0s)]
*  It's a famous historical... [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1074.0s)]
*  Look, you don't know the difference between a claim and an argument. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1075.0s)]
*  You can't defend it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1076.0s)]
*  It's an argument. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1078.0s)]
*  It goes back to David Hume. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1079.0s)]
*  You can't talk about an argument. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1080.0s)]
*  You don't know the difference between... [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1081.0s)]
*  You don't know the difference between... [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1082.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1083.0s)]
*  You don't know the difference between... [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1084.0s)]
*  Look, everyone, look what just happened. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1085.0s)]
*  Look what just happened. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1086.0s)]
*  This guy said... [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1087.0s)]
*  Why are you over talking to me? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1089.0s)]
*  Why are you scared? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1090.0s)]
*  Let me talk. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1091.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1092.0s)]
*  You just claimed that atheists don't have a foundation morality. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1093.0s)]
*  Asked you to defend it. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1094.0s)]
*  And then you said, you can't get an ought from an is. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1095.0s)]
*  What the heck? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1097.0s)]
*  That's the argument. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1098.0s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1099.0s)]
*  It's called an argument. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1100.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1101.0s)]
*  You can't derive that... [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1102.0s)]
*  It's an argument. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1103.0s)]
*  It's not a premise. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1104.0s)]
*  It goes back to David Hume. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1105.0s)]
*  You just didn't know that. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1106.0s)]
*  Okay, Kamigula, I think we're moving slightly off topic. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1107.0s)]
*  Let's bring it back to Pride Month. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1109.0s)]
*  I want to play something which has had a lot of people talking on social media. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1110.5s)]
*  This is Sesame Street where all the puppets are holding hands, making up the Pride flag, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1114.88s)]
*  and they say, on our street, everyone is welcome. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1121.6000000000001s)]
*  Together, let's build a world where every person and family feels loved and respected [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1123.88s)]
*  for who they are. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1128.4s)]
*  Happy Pride Month. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1129.4s)]
*  I guess I would say, Parker, again, the problem with this is it's this kind of enforced virtue [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1130.4s)]
*  signaling. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1135.88s)]
*  It reminds me in a way, for very different reasons, the day in the George Floyd fallout [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1136.88s)]
*  when everyone had to do a black square on their Instagram or somehow they were racist. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1142.3200000000002s)]
*  And I refused and everyone called me a racist. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1146.88s)]
*  I went, why does putting a black square on my Instagram make any difference to anything? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1149.3200000000002s)]
*  Again, with this, if you don't go along with the Pride Month stuff, then somehow you must [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1153.6000000000001s)]
*  be homophobic is the kind of way this all seems to work. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1161.5600000000002s)]
*  And I don't like that. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1165.96s)]
*  I don't understand why we have to have any more of these enforced things where everywhere [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1166.96s)]
*  you go for a whole month, everything's Pride. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1172.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1174.28s)]
*  Why can't you just, everyone just get on with their lives? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1175.28s)]
*  Studies show that strength training burns more fat than cardio alone and is critical [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1179.76s)]
*  for maintaining muscle mass and bone density as we age. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1184.08s)]
*  Jacked Up Fitness has the perfect tool. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1188.6s)]

*  Yeah, so like a way that I would respond to this is by saying that because of the bigotry [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1233.72s)]
*  and dehumanization that exists in our society, it's important to have these things for acceptance [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1237.0s)]
*  to decrease the level of bullying that exists in our society targeted towards the LGBTQ [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1240.36s)]
*  plus community. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1244.32s)]
*  Now, no one's saying that you have to go to Pride, Pirs. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1245.32s)]
*  No one's saying that you have to involve yourself with Pride. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1247.08s)]
*  When I go outside, I live in Los Angeles. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1249.04s)]
*  I don't see rainbow flags everywhere. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1250.6s)]
*  So I'm confused what you're talking about. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1252.6s)]
*  In Los Angeles? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1253.84s)]
*  You must be joking, but you can barely move in Los Angeles. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1254.84s)]
*  I've got a house in Beverly Hills. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1258.44s)]
*  You might as well put a Pride flag over the whole place. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1260.2800000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1263.3600000000001s)]
*  I've been to those areas and Pride flags aren't everywhere. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1264.3600000000001s)]
*  And when you live in Beverly Hills, right, that's specifically like not even right next [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1266.52s)]
*  to downtown. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1270.2s)]
*  So that's where most of the rainbow flags would be. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1271.2s)]
*  But here's my point. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1273.2s)]
*  Here's my serious point to you. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1274.2s)]
*  If you actually want to do something constructive, to say the trans community, for example, wandering [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1276.1200000000001s)]
*  around with LGBTQ plus, and no one can ever remember now how many letters and digits there [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1281.16s)]
*  are on these. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1287.48s)]
*  You just said it. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1288.48s)]
*  It gets bigger and bigger. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1289.48s)]
*  I've seen one with two in it and all sorts of stuff, a two-spirit, whatever. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1290.48s)]
*  All it is is IA plus. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1295.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but then there's two and everything. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1296.0800000000002s)]
*  It gets ridiculous. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1298.24s)]
*  And this is the problem with these things. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1299.24s)]
*  It's never-ending. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1301.0s)]
*  There were two genders, then there were 10, then there were 80, then there were 100. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1302.0s)]
*  All of it is nonsense to me. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1305.96s)]
*  However, if you want to think that, it's a free world. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1308.0800000000002s)]
*  Here's my point. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1312.52s)]
*  If you actually want to make a constructive difference to, say, the trans community and [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1313.6399999999999s)]
*  trans rights and protect trans people, then the absolute worst way to go about that is [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1318.2s)]
*  the way that the trans lobby has tried to do it by eroding women's rights in things [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1324.52s)]
*  like women's sport. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1329.8799999999999s)]
*  That has exposed so many trans people to mockery, abuse, and the rest of it. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1331.36s)]
*  And I would say that rather than spending all this time and effort and money on flags [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1337.68s)]
*  in Pride Month, what about just actually getting people together to understand that [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1342.04s)]
*  eroding women's rights is the worst possible thing to promote trans rights? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1348.36s)]
*  Would you accept that? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1353.72s)]
*  OK, so then if we were going to be talking about eroding women's rights, we'd have to [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1354.72s)]
*  talk about people that, you know, someone like Andrew Wilson supports, like Donald Trump, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1358.2s)]
*  who was held civilly liable of sexually abusing women, who bragged about walking into changing [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1361.72s)]
*  rooms. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1364.96s)]
*  Hang on, let's stick to my question. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1365.96s)]
*  Don't bring Trump into it. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1366.96s)]
*  I promise you I'm making a point relative to this. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1367.96s)]
*  He bragged about walking into changing rooms. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1370.04s)]
*  Smokey man bad. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1371.6s)]
*  Smokey man bad. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1372.6s)]
*  You're very childish. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1373.6s)]
*  All you can do is focus on me. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1374.6s)]
*  You can't even answer to his question. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1375.6s)]
*  But Andrew Wilson bad. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1376.6s)]
*  You're cutting me off. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1377.6s)]
*  Smokey man bad. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1378.6s)]
*  You're cutting me off. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1379.6s)]
*  I'm trying to answer it right now. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1380.6s)]
*  Respectfully, I'm trying to answer it right now, but you're not allowing me to. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1381.6s)]
*  OK, well answer without distracting into Trump and stuff. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1382.6s)]
*  Just answer the question. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1383.6s)]
*  Well, I'm giving an explanation, right? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1384.6s)]
*  So he bragged about walking into the changing rooms of girls in Miss Tina's Day because he [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1385.6s)]
*  quote unquote owns the place to inspect them without the consent. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1386.6s)]
*  Forget Trump. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1387.6s)]

*  Would you let me explain this please? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1392.6s)]
*  You have to get to the point a bit quicker. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1393.6s)]
*  Come on. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1394.6s)]
*  I promise you I am. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1395.6s)]

*  OK, so specifically, right, people like Andrew Wilson do not call that type of stuff out [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1397.6s)]
*  when it's explicitly harmful towards women's rights. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1398.6s)]

*  I'm going to say What About? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1400.6s)]

*  I have always supported trans people's rights to fairness, equality, and safety. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1427.8799999999999s)]
*  Right to the point that it began to erode into women's rights to the same thing. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1432.8999999999999s)]
*  And that's my point to you. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1437.36s)]
*  Why waste all this time, effort, and money on virtue signaling for Pride Month when in [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1438.88s)]
*  fact there's a real problem going on which remains unresolved because too many people [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1443.7600000000002s)]
*  on the left and too many young people go along with this absolute farce of trans athletes [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1448.88s)]
*  in women's sport. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1454.7800000000002s)]
*  Which exposes trans people around the world to extra mockery and abuse. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1456.2800000000002s)]
*  But you'll condemn the mockery and abuse from people like Jay Dyer. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1461.3200000000002s)]
*  From people like Jay Dyer. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1466.2s)]
*  I'm saying you're going to get the mockery when there is something so obviously grotesquely [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1467.2s)]
*  unfair. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1474.96s)]
*  Can I respond? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1475.96s)]
*  Barfi, you've got your hand up very politely. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1476.96s)]
*  So answer me. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1477.96s)]
*  Without mentioning Donald Trump or Andrew Wilson. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1479.96s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1482.48s)]
*  So I can't mention the person on the panel. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1483.56s)]
*  But specifically in terms of trans people. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1485.04s)]
*  Trans people are not specifically going to be harmful towards women in these particular [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1486.8400000000001s)]
*  spaces given that they've met the conditions of multiple years of HRT. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1490.0s)]
*  Have you been? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1493.66s)]
*  Have you been? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1494.66s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1495.66s)]
*  I'm trying to explain. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1496.66s)]
*  Please let me finish. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1497.66s)]
*  No, you button Parker. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1498.66s)]
*  You've got to finish. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1499.66s)]
*  You button Parker. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1500.66s)]
*  Literally as you've said this, today it's been revealed. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1501.66s)]
*  I'm finishing, Piers. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1505.66s)]
*  Today, wait a minute. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1506.66s)]
*  I'm trying to explain, Piers. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1507.66s)]
*  You talked about safety. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1508.66s)]
*  This is disingenuous. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1509.66s)]
*  Literally today, the Algerian gold medal winner in the Paris Olympics. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1510.66s)]
*  I haven't been able to speak. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1515.66s)]
*  Women's boxing has been revealed to be a man who should never have been competing. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1516.66s)]
*  Piers, can I speak? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1522.66s)]
*  That's why. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1523.66s)]
*  What do people feel when they're on your panels and you're muted, Parker? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1524.66s)]
*  Can I speak without interruption, please? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1526.66s)]
*  All right, answer. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1527.66s)]
*  I've been incredibly nice on this panel. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1528.66s)]
*  I would love to be able to speak without interruption. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1530.66s)]
*  Is that okay, Piers? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1532.66s)]
*  Yes, but answer my question. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1533.66s)]
*  Yeah, I was trying to answer the question you cut me off. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1534.66s)]
*  So specifically, I don't think trans people in these spaces would be harmful after multiple [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1536.66s)]
*  years of HRT and or not going through a male puberty as I've seen no good evidence from [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1539.66s)]
*  any scientific studies that indicate that there would be an unfair biological advantage [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1543.66s)]
*  at that point. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1546.66s)]
*  Iman Khalif, what are you talking about, man? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1547.66s)]
*  Listen, listen. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1549.66s)]
*  I'm still explaining. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1550.66s)]
*  Parker, you're talking complete gibberish, man. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1551.66s)]
*  Can I please finish? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1552.66s)]
*  Iman Khalif has literally just been exposed as a biological male who won Olympic gold [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1553.66s)]
*  in women's boxing and beat up an Italian boxer, woman, so badly she quit in 43 seconds and [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1560.66s)]
*  said she thought she was going to die in the ring. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1568.66s)]
*  So the whole argument you just put forward is literally disproved by a news story today. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1570.66s)]
*  That's the point I was making to you. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1576.66s)]
*  Of course it's dangerous. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1578.66s)]
*  Piers, have they got... [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1579.66s)]
*  To allow biological men to get in a boxing ring and beat up women, it is dangerous. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1580.66s)]
*  Piers, has that person been through multiple years of HRT? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1586.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1589.66s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1590.66s)]
*  Then they haven't met my set of criteria. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1591.66s)]
*  That person is a man. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1592.66s)]
*  So how is that a critique of my world view if they haven't met the set of criteria that [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1593.66s)]
*  I mentioned? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1596.66s)]
*  Can I please finish? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1597.66s)]
*  Can I please mention? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1598.66s)]
*  Can I please mention? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1599.66s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1600.66s)]
*  So again, let me please finish. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1601.66s)]
*  All right. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1602.66s)]
*  I am saying if they meet this set of criteria, then they can play and there's nothing unfair [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1603.66s)]
*  biologically speaking that you can identify scientifically. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1607.66s)]
*  There is though. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1608.66s)]
*  This is where you're so deluded. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1609.66s)]
*  You're so deluded. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1610.66s)]
*  Because even if you have all the treatment, you still retain the body mass, the muscle [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1611.66s)]
*  mass, the lung capacity. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1618.66s)]
*  You retain all the biological advantages of being born a man. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1620.26s)]
*  Not after multiple years of HRT. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1623.66s)]
*  Yes you do. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1624.66s)]
*  Yes you do. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1625.66s)]
*  Wait, you want to bet, Piers? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1626.66s)]
*  Piers, put money on it. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1627.66s)]
*  You said you retain every biological advantage. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1628.66s)]
*  Muscle mass. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1629.66s)]
*  You have gone through multiple years of HRT. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1630.66s)]
*  Lung capacity. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1631.66s)]
*  You don't think muscle mass can one-passly go down? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1632.66s)]
*  You want to bet your entire savings of your entire life that I'm right and you're wrong? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1633.66s)]
*  Piers, Piers, Piers, let's bet $1,000 right now that there are lower biological advantages [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1637.66s)]
*  that would specifically exist given that someone goes through multiple years of HRT, right, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1643.66s)]
*  relative to estrogen. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1647.66s)]
*  No, you're missing my point. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1648.66s)]
*  Take that bet. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1650.66s)]
*  Take that bet. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1651.66s)]
*  Are you missing my point? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1652.66s)]
*  Are you going to accept the bet? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1653.66s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1654.66s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1655.66s)]
*  You can have all the HRT treatment you like. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1656.66s)]
*  $1,000, Piers. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1657.66s)]
*  You can have all the testosterone. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1658.66s)]
*  $1,000. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1659.66s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1660.66s)]
*  He's not going to accept it. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1661.66s)]
*  Let me answer. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1662.66s)]
*  Let me answer. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1663.66s)]
*  I'll tell you the bet I'll make. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1664.66s)]
*  If you want to bet the $1,000. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1665.66s)]
*  If you want to bet the $1,000 that if you go through testosterone reduction treatment [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1666.66s)]
*  and the rest of it, that you come out of it with a reduced muscle mass or lung capacity [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1670.66s)]
*  or the other things that give men an advantage, take that bet for me. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1676.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1680.66s)]
*  So I will bet after multiple years of HRT specifically relating to estrogen, right, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1681.66s)]
*  there is a reduction in muscle mass. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1685.66s)]
*  You want to take that bet, Piers? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1686.66s)]
*  It's bullshit. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1687.66s)]
*  Andrew Wilson. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1688.66s)]
*  OK, let's take that bet. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1689.66s)]
*  Andrew Wilson. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1690.66s)]
*  Do you want to take it? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1691.66s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1692.66s)]
*  Andrew Wilson. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1693.66s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1694.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1696.66s)]
*  So when you're talking specifically about this, the whole LGBTQ thing has backfired [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1697.66s)]
*  greatly. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1703.16s)]
*  And it's because this whole thing, Pride is astroturfed. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1704.66s)]
*  It's literally astroturfed. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1707.66s)]
*  You just showed us how. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1709.66s)]
*  I mean, you have a massive corporation putting out propaganda for a children's TV show showing [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1710.66s)]
*  a bunch of hands in a rainbow, this and that. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1716.66s)]
*  It's very clear that this is backfiring. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1720.66s)]
*  And by the way, the trans movement set the gay rights movement back 20 years or more. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1723.66s)]
*  You can't convince us, Parker, even if you're attracted to men who you call women, that [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1729.66s)]
*  the rest of us need to call them women or men. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1734.66s)]
*  Like, they either are or they aren't. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1737.66s)]
*  Is this not changing the topic? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1739.66s)]
*  You have been trying to convince people forever that there's no way to distinguish these things. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1740.66s)]
*  Look, the average normal person, they can tell that these guys who go out and go, Hey, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1747.66s)]
*  how are you doing? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1754.66s)]
*  My name is Chuck with long hair are clearly not women. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1755.66s)]
*  Parker, like we know this. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1758.66s)]
*  And so what happens is you guys gaslight everybody and try to pretend that, hey, you just can't [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1760.66s)]
*  really know it's too vague. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1765.66s)]
*  We can't really get to the meat potatoes here. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1767.66s)]
*  It's like, you know, we do know Parker and you have not been able to successfully with [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1769.66s)]
*  your tick tock brain convince people that men can be women and women can be men. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1773.66s)]
*  You haven't done that. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1777.66s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons that you see pride falling behind is because of all of [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1778.66s)]
*  this gaslighting. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1783.66s)]
*  People are rejecting it. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1784.66s)]
*  Tax Day has passed, but for millions of Americans, that's where the trouble begins. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1786.66s)]
*  The IRS is now ramping up enforcement for those who miss the April deadline or still [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1790.66s)]
*  owe back taxes. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1795.66s)]
*  Well, today's sponsor, Tax Network USA, can still help. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1796.66s)]
*  If your books are a mess, you're self-employed, or if you're a business owner, Tax Network [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1800.66s)]
*  USA specializes in cleaning up financial chaos and getting you back on track quickly. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1805.66s)]
*  They say the IRS is applying enforcement pressure at levels they've never seen before. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1811.66s)]
*  But even after the deadline, it's not too late to take control. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1816.66s)]
*  The consultation is completely free. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1820.66s)]
*  Acting now could stop stop penalties, threatening letters and surprise levies before they escalate. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1822.66s)]
*  Call 1-800-958-1000 or visit tnusa.com slash peers. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1829.66s)]
*  That's tnusa.com slash peers. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1837.66s)]
*  Let Tax Network USA make the next move, not the IRS. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1841.66s)]
*  Let's move on to another subject. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1847.66s)]
*  Can I respond? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1848.66s)]
*  Can I respond? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1849.66s)]
*  Very quickly. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1850.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1851.66s)]
*  So one, I'm not saying that men can be women. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1852.66s)]
*  We're making the claim that trans women are women and trans men are men. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1853.66s)]
*  That's a separate claim from the original claim about pride. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1856.66s)]
*  I do want to address the claim specifically about pride and how we're addressing how people are negatively impacted. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1858.66s)]
*  And as a society, we want to address this in terms of this so that we can reduce the likelihood of people being harmed or negatively impacted or not accepted in these communities. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1862.66s)]
*  That's the point of pride in these conditions. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1868.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1870.66s)]
*  Just because it is the case that issues have existed to a greater extent in the past doesn't mean that we don't have an issue to address today. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1871.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1875.66s)]
*  In terms of pride, right, like addressing that we should have acceptance of gay people, we should have acceptance of people in the LGBT community. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1876.66s)]
*  So that's counterintuitive though, Parker, to say, clearly, clearly, clearly it's backfiring. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1883.66s)]
*  Like, it seems like it's counterintuitive. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1891.66s)]
*  If you push the problem, you're making it backfiring. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1892.66s)]
*  Let me bring in Danny. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1895.66s)]
*  Let me bring in Danny. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1897.66s)]
*  Danny, have a say. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1899.66s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1900.66s)]
*  I want to highlight that what the corporations do, right. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1901.66s)]
*  I might agree with you. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1904.66s)]
*  Some of them sell out for pride, right? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1905.66s)]
*  They, you know, it's marketable. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1906.66s)]
*  I might agree with you, but pride is way more than just what the corporations do. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1907.66s)]
*  It's how people, you know, identify with their sexuality and, you know, kind of anti-bullying agenda. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1911.66s)]
*  That's very important in terms of pride. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1916.66s)]
*  Whatever the corporations do, they sell out, they sell out. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1919.66s)]
*  But you can still have pride, whatever they do. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1921.66s)]
*  Yeah, you can have pride. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1923.66s)]
*  But why do you have to have? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1924.66s)]
*  Why do you have to have all the commercialization behind it? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1925.66s)]
*  It's not organic, Danny. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1927.66s)]
*  Anti-bullying is inherently criminal. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1929.66s)]
*  This is not organically people coming together anymore to force this. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1932.66s)]
*  This is a bunch of NGOs which go to corporate injuries. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1936.66s)]
*  Andrew, if you were actually Christian, you would be in support of pride. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1938.66s)]
*  If you were actually Christian, you'd be in support of pride because you'd be accepting people. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1940.66s)]
*  Is there a cardinal sin called pride? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1943.66s)]
*  Is there a cardinal sin called pride? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1945.66s)]
*  It's not pride in a literal sense. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1948.66s)]
*  It's pride specifically in the sense of accepting people. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1949.66s)]
*  That's a very good point. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1951.66s)]
*  Pride is the same sense of pride. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1952.66s)]
*  Why are you celebrating sin? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1953.66s)]
*  It's not pride in the sense of celebrating sin. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1955.66s)]
*  You're misunderstanding. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1957.66s)]
*  You're misunderstanding. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1959.66s)]
*  It's not pride in a literal sense. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1960.66s)]
*  It's pride in the sense specifically where we're accepting people, specifically for being gay, right? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1961.66s)]
*  For being trans. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1966.66s)]
*  That's not Christian. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1967.66s)]
*  I'm proud of it. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1968.66s)]
*  Christianity tells you to love everyone and tells you to accept people who are human beings made in the image of God. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1969.66s)]
*  It doesn't only say that. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1974.66s)]
*  It also talks about boundaries and limitations. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1976.66s)]
*  You have to have a basis for virtue versus vice. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1979.66s)]
*  Christianity is a virtue-vice ethic, and your whole ethos is to defend your own personal vices because your ethics are all purely subjective. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1982.66s)]
*  Are you proud to be a Christian, Jay? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1989.66s)]
*  Other than what you say is the case. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1991.66s)]
*  Jay, are you proud to be a Christian? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1994.66s)]
*  Sure. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1996.66s)]
*  Oh, that's a sin. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1997.66s)]
*  That's an equivocation. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=1998.66s)]
*  I didn't make the argument. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2000.66s)]
*  I didn't make the argument that's an equivocation. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2002.66s)]
*  We're not talking about the cardinal sin. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2003.66s)]
*  What's an equivocation fallacy? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2005.66s)]
*  We're talking about the sense of pride that matters to your identity, who you are, Christian, gay, straight. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2006.66s)]
*  I said virtue-vice ethic, and you used an argument from equivocation. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2011.66s)]
*  It's two different uses of the word. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2014.66s)]
*  No, you're equivocating. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2015.66s)]
*  You brought up the cardinal sin. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2016.66s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2017.66s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2018.66s)]
*  I didn't say that pride is the sin that is... [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2019.66s)]
*  Respectfully, wasn't that exactly what you guys were doing when I said that pride wasn't used in a literal sense, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2022.66s)]
*  but then you guys equivocated and said that we were... [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2026.66s)]
*  I didn't make that argument. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2028.66s)]
*  Andrew made that argument. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2030.66s)]
*  I said you don't have a basis for virtue or vice. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2031.66s)]
*  So Andrew made a mistake. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2033.66s)]
*  So Andrew made a mistake. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2034.66s)]
*  I said you don't have a basis for virtue or vice. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2035.66s)]
*  No, we were basing this around the idea that Parker said. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2037.66s)]
*  What Parker said specifically here was, well, wait a second. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2041.66s)]
*  If you're a Christian, you should be all about this. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2045.66s)]
*  And it's like, no, not really. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2048.66s)]
*  And you haven't really demonstrated how. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2050.66s)]
*  Why? Why, Parker? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2052.66s)]
*  Why is it that we need to support homosexuality as Christians? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2053.66s)]
*  Parker, tell us why. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2057.66s)]
*  Well, I was saying that you should be loving of thy neighbor as you're referencing specifically people, right? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2058.66s)]
*  Human beings, right? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2063.66s)]
*  Why does that mean we have to support homosexuality? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2064.66s)]
*  Why do we have to support homosexuality? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2068.66s)]
*  I'm saying that you have to be accepting of people who are homosexual. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2070.66s)]
*  Why do we need to support homosexuality, Parker? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2074.66s)]
*  OK, we're not saying you need to support like engaging in gay intercourse. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2078.66s)]
*  We're saying that you need to support people who are gay as they are people. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2082.66s)]
*  Why? Why do we need to support them? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2085.66s)]
*  Why do we need to support them in things that we consider sinful? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2087.66s)]
*  You want us to support sin? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2090.66s)]
*  Wait, I'm not saying that you necessarily support sin. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2091.66s)]
*  I'm saying you're supporting the person who engages in sin. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2094.66s)]
*  The same way you're a sinner and that you engage in it, you should be. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2097.66s)]
*  So when homosexuals come to the church and they reject homosexuality, they're no longer acting in that way. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2099.66s)]
*  They are accepted. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2105.66s)]
*  They're not rejected. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2106.66s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2107.66s)]
*  It's an action. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2108.66s)]
*  It's not an identity. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2109.66s)]
*  So there's a vice virtue ethic that they're not understanding. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2110.66s)]
*  It's not an identity. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2114.66s)]
*  It's a vice. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2115.66s)]
*  Wait, well, I want to bring this. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2116.66s)]
*  I want to bring the private into it. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2118.66s)]
*  We're going to move on to the last topic. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2120.66s)]
*  All I would say is that I absolutely do not think homosexuality is a sin. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2121.66s)]
*  I completely respect everyone's right to have any sex with anybody. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2126.66s)]
*  I just don't see the point in spending a whole month allowing companies to virtue signal their way into making tons of money out of it. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2130.66s)]
*  I just think it's the grasping commercialization of sexuality. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2138.66s)]
*  Is your issue just how long? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2144.66s)]
*  Do you just want a week or a day? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2146.66s)]
*  If you want to have a pride day, fine. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2148.66s)]
*  But why a month? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2151.66s)]
*  What does it matter if it's a month or a day? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2153.66s)]
*  What does it matter if it's a month or a day? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2155.66s)]
*  If it's a day, it's a day longer than I get as a straight guy. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2158.66s)]
*  I mean, what about me? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2162.66s)]
*  Where am I with my day? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2164.66s)]
*  Are you bullied for being straight? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2166.66s)]
*  I get bullied all the time. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2168.66s)]
*  I've been bullied on social media all day. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2170.66s)]
*  Not for being straight. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2172.66s)]
*  No. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2173.66s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2174.66s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2175.66s)]
*  I want to play a clip from Joe Rogan. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2176.66s)]
*  I'm going to start with you, Jay, on this. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2178.66s)]
*  This is Joe Rogan talking about the R-word. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2180.66s)]
*  It's one of these retarded shows where there are screaming. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2184.66s)]
*  I'm going to say that word again. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2187.66s)]
*  We brought it. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2188.66s)]
*  We were just talking about that. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2189.66s)]
*  You did it earlier. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2190.66s)]
*  The word retarded is back. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2191.66s)]
*  And it's one of the great culture victories. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2193.66s)]
*  That I think is spurred on probably by podcasts. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2196.66s)]
*  Now, Jay, is it a great moment, a great cultural victory that the R-word is back, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2200.66s)]
*  which obviously is short for it's retarded, it's mentally retarded. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2205.66s)]
*  It's for people who are mentally impaired. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2210.66s)]
*  It was used in a derogatory way against people who are mentally impaired. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2212.66s)]
*  Why would that be a cultural victory to bring that back? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2215.66s)]
*  Well, I'm a big fan of the R-word because I myself act retarded all the time. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2218.66s)]
*  And I'm proud of it. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2224.66s)]
*  In fact, I would actually probably get retarded tattooed across my back. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2225.66s)]
*  Because I think it is a cultural victory. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2229.66s)]
*  I'd love to be able to say what's on my mind. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2231.66s)]
*  I think, I mean, well, these guys are retarded as an example. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2234.66s)]
*  So we have panelists that are retarded. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2238.66s)]
*  So yeah, I love the R-word. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2241.66s)]
*  I'm rated R totally. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2243.66s)]
*  And I think that it's a freeing thing. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2244.66s)]
*  It's a way to express the way we express things in the 80s and the 90s without a problem. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2246.66s)]
*  You can go watch Bill Murray comedy movies and they're great because... [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2251.66s)]
*  Yeah, but people used to use the N-word, you know, 30, 40 years ago, right? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2254.66s)]
*  Yeah, and I champion all the comedians that still use the N-word. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2260.66s)]
*  But that became something that was taboo in society [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2263.66s)]
*  because it was deemed to be very offensive to black people. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2265.66s)]
*  The R-word, the use of the R-word is deemed to be very offensive to people. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2268.66s)]
*  It's very offensive to people who are genuinely mentally impaired and they don't like it. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2272.66s)]
*  He's making a soy face like he's like freaking out over there. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2277.66s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sorry. You just said it's justified for white people to say the N-word. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2280.66s)]
*  And what's wrong, morally wrong. I don't equate the two. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2283.66s)]
*  Parker, your response. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2286.66s)]
*  So here's my question. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2288.66s)]
*  Do you think that Jesus would say the N-word and do you think Jesus would say the R-slur? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2289.66s)]
*  Jesus does say jokes and slurs in the Gospels, yes. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2293.66s)]
*  He talks about... [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2296.66s)]
*  So Jesus would say the R-slur in the N-word. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2298.66s)]
*  He calls people dogs. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2300.66s)]
*  He calls people dogs in reference to you guys' advice. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2301.66s)]
*  Parker, do people in your friendship group ever use the R-word? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2306.66s)]
*  No, never. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2310.66s)]
*  It's just a taboo word. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2312.66s)]
*  Yes, I think it's incredibly wrong to use. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2314.66s)]
*  You shouldn't use it. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2316.66s)]
*  People in your friend group might use it a lot. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2317.66s)]
*  But on that of interest, Parker, what is your rationale personally for not using it? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2319.66s)]
*  I think it's incredibly harmful in the same way that we don't use other sorts of things. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2324.66s)]
*  It's harmful in the same way that we don't use other sorts of slurs because they're harmful. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2328.66s)]
*  I think that we should use this word because it's harmful. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2331.66s)]
*  If your arguments hurt my feelings, should you not argue? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2333.66s)]
*  No, specifically we're saying it meets a threshold of harm. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2336.66s)]
*  Whose threshold? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2339.66s)]
*  Because the R-slur and the... [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2340.66s)]
*  Whose threshold? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2341.66s)]
*  My threshold. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2342.66s)]
*  Your threshold is arbitrary. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2343.66s)]
*  That's a subjective argument, thank you. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2344.66s)]
*  So it's only your personal subjective taste. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2346.66s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2348.66s)]
*  If it's your personal subjective taste, then it can also be my... [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2349.66s)]
*  Okay, well the Parker doesn't reach our threshold, Parker. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2352.66s)]
*  Oh, I understand, Andrew. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2355.66s)]
*  That would be your perspective on the matter. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2358.66s)]
*  But given my perspective, I would say that meets my threshold. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2360.66s)]
*  Are you saying it's okay to use the N-word, Andrew? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2362.66s)]
*  And it's subjective and it doesn't work as an argument. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2364.66s)]
*  Wait, why is he saying people like, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2366.66s)]
*  Andrew, Andrew, Andrew, Andrew. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2369.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2370.66s)]
*  Parker, Parker, Parker. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2371.66s)]
*  Is it ever okay to use the word retard? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2372.66s)]
*  No. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2375.66s)]
*  Is it okay for you to use the N-word? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2376.66s)]
*  Is it even okay to use the word retard to reference the word retard? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2377.66s)]
*  I think it's wrong to use it in general. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2382.66s)]
*  Can you please? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2384.66s)]
*  Can you answer my question and then I'll answer yours, I promise. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2385.66s)]
*  I said it's wrong. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2388.66s)]
*  Is it okay to refer to the word retard if you're explaining the word retard? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2389.66s)]
*  Say arse-ler. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2394.66s)]
*  So you can't even use... [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2396.66s)]
*  So just the word itself. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2398.66s)]
*  Okay, so here's the thing that's so funny about this, right? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2400.66s)]
*  It's like ultimately when we say... [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2402.66s)]
*  Am I able to ask a question yet? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2404.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2406.66s)]
*  So I wouldn't use the N-word. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2407.66s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2408.66s)]
*  When I say that if somebody says the N-word, what ends up ultimately happening, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2409.66s)]
*  there's not really too much in the way of equivocation there. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2412.66s)]
*  Retard is not actually referring to retarded people though. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2414.66s)]
*  Basically ever. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2418.66s)]
*  Nobody ever says it, Parker, to refer to somebody who's actually retarded. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2419.66s)]
*  That doesn't change it. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2423.66s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2425.66s)]
*  If you're using the N-word to refer to a white person, it's still wrong. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2426.66s)]
*  Would you use the N-word to refer to a white person? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2429.66s)]
*  I mean, in some circumstances, I think that you can use it in a comedic sense. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2431.66s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2434.66s)]
*  Sure. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2435.66s)]
*  You think white people using the N-word is okay in any circumstance? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2436.66s)]
*  Yeah, comedic senses especially. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2439.66s)]
*  I think it's fine. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2441.66s)]
*  That's disgusting as fuck. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2442.66s)]
*  Oh my God! [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2443.66s)]
*  Is that an argument? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2444.66s)]
*  Is that an argument, Parker? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2445.66s)]
*  Wait, me calling something disgusting because I think it goes against my moral intuition? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2448.66s)]
*  Oh, you think it's disgusting? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2452.66s)]
*  Okay, you're right. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2453.66s)]
*  Homosexuality is disgusting because it goes against my moral intuition. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2454.66s)]
*  All right, let me bring in Danny. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2456.66s)]
*  Can I respond? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2458.66s)]
*  Hang on, hang on, hang on. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2459.66s)]
*  Let me bring in Danny. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2461.66s)]
*  This is what NBC said at NBC News when they covered the return of the R-word. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2462.66s)]
*  They said, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2467.66s)]
*  While its use is percolated in the comedy world for years, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2468.66s)]
*  only recently has the word and discussion of its return become more normalized, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2471.66s)]
*  that is fueled in no small part by a sense that the tide has turned both culturally and politically [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2475.66s)]
*  against those seeking to keep the word out of the popular lexicon. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2481.66s)]
*  But the battle lines are not as clear as one might think. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2484.66s)]
*  And there's no doubt that's true. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2487.66s)]
*  I mean, what is your view about this? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2489.66s)]
*  I mean, we've got to remind ourselves why people like us are against the use of the R-word, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2492.66s)]
*  and especially in public places. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2499.66s)]
*  It's because it was a term, I think I believe, a technical term for mentally disabled people. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2500.66s)]
*  And we don't want to demean those people or accidentally offend people that have children or relatives or friends that are mentally disabled. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2505.66s)]
*  And so it has that connotation, unlike the word dog. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2514.66s)]
*  When Jesus used the term dog, there's no such connotation. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2518.66s)]
*  You'll have to be reminded of why it's considered to be a slur. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2521.66s)]
*  I mean, it's like you forgot. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2525.66s)]
*  Yeah, but so is the word moron. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2526.66s)]
*  So was the word moron. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2529.66s)]
*  The word moron had a really negative societal connotation and still does. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2530.66s)]
*  And people use it all the time just in lieu of the word retard. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2534.66s)]
*  They'll just say you're a moron instead of you're a retard. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2537.66s)]
*  It's like, hang on, hang on. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2539.66s)]
*  You're begging, you're picking and choosing. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2541.66s)]
*  Yeah, you're picking and choosing which thing to be selectively offended by. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2544.66s)]
*  You're not. I don't. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2548.66s)]
*  So, like, let me ask you guys this honestly. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2549.66s)]
*  I want you guys to answer me fucking honestly. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2551.66s)]
*  Does the word retard actually offend you? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2554.66s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2557.66s)]
*  I think it's fucked up. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2558.66s)]
*  You use. I've been very clear. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2559.66s)]
*  Does it actually offend you, Danny? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2560.66s)]
*  When somebody says, wait a minute. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2561.66s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2563.66s)]
*  So if Zach Galifianakis. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2564.66s)]
*  So Zach Galifianakis does some when he does comedy and he does a movie and he makes a joke and says retort. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2566.66s)]
*  Is that also bad? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2574.66s)]
*  I'm confused the context of what you're referencing. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2576.66s)]
*  Is he specifically trying to go into the answer? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2578.66s)]
*  Then yes. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2580.66s)]
*  So now the answer is retar. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2581.66s)]
*  I don't. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2583.66s)]
*  OK, then yes, that's wrong. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2584.66s)]
*  Yes, that's wrong. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2586.66s)]
*  I thought you were saying like someone. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2587.66s)]
*  I thought you were. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2589.66s)]
*  I thought references. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2590.66s)]
*  Another word now is wrong. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2591.66s)]
*  Like more wrong. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2592.66s)]
*  So specifically in terms of the one I thought you were referencing, I thought you were referencing like someone responding to an argument. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2594.66s)]
*  I thought the particular. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2598.66s)]
*  Zach Galifianakis in a comedy movie saying retort as a joke instead of retard. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2600.66s)]
*  So if you're saying that's incredibly fucked up to use. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2605.66s)]
*  OK, so now also any word that refers to the word retard is now wrong. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2607.66s)]
*  Like more on I think if you're intentionally specifically trying to use a word right in place specifically of the arse. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2612.66s)]
*  Specifically as to create the same type of outcome as the arse. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2617.66s)]
*  Any word that could refer to that particular intention. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2620.66s)]
*  I think that particular intention would be you can't say the word more on. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2623.66s)]
*  So now you can't say the word more on. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2626.66s)]
*  You don't necessarily have that intention. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2628.66s)]
*  So this is your spiraling into insanity because that's not that's not I gave two conditions to separate. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2630.66s)]
*  I gave two conditions to separate it. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2634.66s)]
*  I gave two conditions. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2635.66s)]
*  Wait, it being it's subjective. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2636.66s)]
*  Your conditions are arbitrary. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2637.66s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2638.66s)]
*  It being subjective is not a critique. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2639.66s)]
*  That's not a critique against the view. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2640.66s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2642.66s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2643.66s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2644.66s)]
*  How is that a critique? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2645.66s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2646.66s)]
*  If something is purely subjective, then I can come with all the same claims with all the same force and there's no way to resolve the two. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2647.66s)]
*  That's why purely subjective arguments fail. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2651.66s)]
*  Wait, they're not being a resolution particularly between the moral disagreement of me and you isn't a critique particularly of my perspective. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2653.66s)]
*  Then you can't say anything is morally wrong. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2660.66s)]
*  There's no ought from an is. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2662.66s)]
*  Wait, I can say something is morally wrong under my perspective. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2663.66s)]
*  You're misunderstanding subjective morality. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2666.66s)]
*  You're not giving me why it's long, morally, objectively, if I can also counter it. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2668.66s)]
*  Can I ask you this question? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2674.66s)]
*  Do you think that morality is true dependent upon God's stance or independent of God's stance? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2675.66s)]
*  Ultimately, it's grounded in God. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2679.66s)]
*  Okay, so subject. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2681.66s)]
*  Yeah, that is. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2683.66s)]
*  That's not a subjective argument. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2684.66s)]
*  The argument is that it's objective. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2686.66s)]
*  The fact that a person makes an argument doesn't make the argument subjective. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2690.66s)]
*  Your argument is your subjectivism. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2695.66s)]
*  Is God a subject? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2697.66s)]
*  Two different things. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2698.66s)]
*  It's a category error. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2699.66s)]
*  How is that a category error? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2700.66s)]
*  It's two different categories. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2702.66s)]
*  A subjective argument for ethics is different than a person who's a subject making an argument. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2705.66s)]
*  The point is that God is a subject. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2712.66s)]
*  He's not an object, right? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2714.66s)]
*  We're subjects, right? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2715.66s)]
*  We understand morality in terms of God. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2716.66s)]
*  You're equivocating again. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2718.66s)]
*  Can we bring this back to the point? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2720.66s)]
*  No, you want to run away. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2722.66s)]
*  No, we can't. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2724.66s)]
*  Wait, God having his particular view on morality is no different than me having my view because we're both subjects. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2725.66s)]
*  The argument is that it's an objective morality. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2729.66s)]
*  Jay, what is the subject? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2731.66s)]
*  You're equivocating on the fact that a subject is making an argument versus the argument being subjective. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2733.66s)]
*  That's a philosophical category error. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2740.66s)]
*  Jay, I asked you a truth. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2742.66s)]
*  This is like talking to children. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2744.66s)]
*  It's a category error, you idiot. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2745.66s)]
*  I gave you the youth road dilemma. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2747.66s)]
*  I asked you if it's true, dependent upon a stance or independent of a stance. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2749.66s)]
*  You said it's dependent upon God's stance. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2751.66s)]
*  That's subjective by definition. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2753.66s)]
*  I said that the argument for Christian ethics is not a subjectivist ethic. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2754.66s)]
*  And because God is a subject, it doesn't make the system subjective. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2760.66s)]
*  That's an equivocation error on your part. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2764.66s)]
*  What do you think subjective means, Jay? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2766.66s)]
*  Purely relative to the individual. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2768.66s)]
*  Okay, so true dependent upon a stance. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2771.66s)]
*  Is God an individual? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2774.66s)]
*  That doesn't mean that the ethic is subjective. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2776.66s)]
*  It's an objective ethic. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2779.66s)]
*  You're just rephrasing, you're substituting the word individual for subject. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2781.66s)]
*  I'm asking you if God is an individual, yes or no, Howard. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2786.66s)]
*  That doesn't mean that the ethics is subjective. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2789.66s)]
*  Yes or no. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2792.66s)]
*  Who's running now? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2793.66s)]
*  It's a systemological argument that's different from the subject. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2794.66s)]
*  Let me bring Andrew. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2797.66s)]
*  Andrew, you wanted to get in here. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2799.66s)]
*  Jay's getting cooked. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2802.66s)]
*  What are we going to say? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2803.66s)]
*  Jay's getting cooked. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2804.66s)]
*  You're making a dumb mistake. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2805.66s)]
*  Last question. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2806.66s)]
*  Hang on, let Andrew come in, please. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2807.66s)]
*  Yeah, so, I mean, this is kind of obfuscating from the point. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2810.66s)]
*  What does any of that have to do with the point of retard? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2815.66s)]
*  He brought up subjective morality. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2818.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, can you hang on? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2820.66s)]
*  I'm talking to Parker, not you, Danny. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2822.66s)]
*  Calm down. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2823.66s)]
*  I'm talking to you, but you're off this whole time. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2824.66s)]
*  I don't understand, yeah, I don't understand, Parker. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2826.66s)]
*  A friend of yours comes over and he says something to you like you're in private. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2829.66s)]
*  He's like, hey, hand me that. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2834.66s)]
*  He toss it, you miss it. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2835.66s)]
*  He goes, you retard. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2836.66s)]
*  You literally stop the kind of you go. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2838.66s)]
*  Don't say that. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2840.66s)]
*  It's very offensive. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2841.66s)]
*  Do you say that? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2842.66s)]
*  It's very offensive. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2843.66s)]
*  I really don't like it when you say, do you dress him down, Parker? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2844.66s)]
*  Yeah, so it calls you retard or friendly word. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2846.66s)]
*  I'm sorry, my mic cut out so I couldn't hear you. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2848.66s)]
*  I want to put something to Andrew. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2852.66s)]
*  If you have a friend, if you have a friend, shut up, Danny. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2853.66s)]
*  If you have a friend, Parker, and your buddy comes over and he like tosses you something [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2856.66s)]
*  and you drop it and he's like, you retard. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2860.66s)]
*  You dress him down. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2862.66s)]
*  Do you go, I can't believe it. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2863.66s)]
*  You call me a retard. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2865.66s)]
*  Why? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2866.66s)]
*  I would like to take a little bit of a response. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2867.66s)]
*  But who's around Parker? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2869.66s)]
*  Who's around to be offended except you? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2871.66s)]
*  I'd like to talk. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2875.66s)]
*  Who's around to be offended but you? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2876.66s)]
*  That doesn't change whether or not I think it's wrong. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2877.66s)]
*  Let Danny respond. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2879.66s)]
*  Danny? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2881.66s)]
*  Well, I want to give Andrew a hypothetical. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2882.66s)]
*  Suppose there's this unknown society where if you show this signal, everyone's extremely [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2884.66s)]
*  offended. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2889.66s)]
*  They'll get very angry. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2890.66s)]
*  Like, people get angry at the typical slurs like the N-word, right? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2891.66s)]
*  Would you go around just doing this? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2894.66s)]
*  The Vulcan sign for logic? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2896.66s)]
*  Do you understand the hypothetical? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2898.66s)]
*  What? [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2900.66s)]
*  Are you posing a hypothetical? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2901.66s)]
*  Do you understand the hypothetical? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2903.66s)]
*  So imagine you go to a making side where this is- [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2904.66s)]
*  Can you use really small words, bro? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2906.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2908.66s)]
*  Imagine a hypothetical, right, where you're going to a making side. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2909.66s)]
*  You're going to a society you don't know about but all you know is if you do this- [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2913.66s)]
*  I'm imagining a hypothetical? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2916.66s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2918.66s)]
*  You didn't understand the hypothetical so I'm having to repeat it. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2919.66s)]
*  So let me finish. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2921.66s)]
*  Yeah, repeat it. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2922.66s)]
*  Use small words. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2923.66s)]
*  Let's say this signal is extremely offensive in that society, really offends people. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2924.66s)]
*  Would you go around just doing this to troll people or would you not do it? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2928.66s)]
*  I would definitely tell them to live long and prosper, bro. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2932.66s)]
*  Okay, you're just not engaging in the hypothetical. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2934.66s)]
*  You're not a serious person. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2936.66s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2937.66s)]
*  That is serious. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2938.66s)]
*  What I'm trying to illustrate is that if a term really offends a friend of someone, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2939.66s)]
*  right, or a family member or something like that, why would you use the term but to piss them off? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2943.66s)]
*  The trouble is that we've got to a place in our society where the language police are now so out of control [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2947.66s)]
*  that we can't even use the word in hospitals, mother, because somebody who is a trans person, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2955.66s)]
*  trans man who's having a baby, objects to the word mother. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2964.66s)]
*  And that's the problem with language police is that if there's no natural societal limitation to it, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2969.66s)]
*  it's never ending. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2975.66s)]
*  Somebody somewhere will always be offended by a word somewhere. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2976.66s)]
*  And at the moment in society, it's like there are a thousand words that upset people. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2981.66s)]
*  That's my problem with it. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2986.66s)]
*  And Danny, what are you doing that same hypothetical? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2987.66s)]
*  Half the people mean it a different way. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2990.66s)]
*  Parker, you want to respond to that? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2992.66s)]
*  No, I want to respond to this particular point. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2994.66s)]
*  Christians get oftentimes very angry about specific terms you use, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2996.66s)]
*  whether it be in the context of their particular beliefs, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=2999.66s)]
*  whether it be transubstantiation, calling them a cannibal specifically under their view, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3001.66s)]
*  if it is the case that they think it's the actual body and blood of Christ [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3004.66s)]
*  that they're eating specifically and drinking within communion, right? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3008.66s)]
*  Us calling them a cannibal, they get really, really angry with. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3011.66s)]
*  Or us blaspheming the Holy Spirit, they get really angry with. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3014.66s)]
*  And you don't seem to care about doing that, do you? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3016.66s)]
*  They are, they're, no, I don't. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3018.66s)]
*  They're the tone police. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3020.66s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3021.66s)]
*  You guys don't talk about that. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3022.66s)]
*  No, it's not because I'm not a Christian. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3024.66s)]
*  I don't hold those perspectives. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3026.66s)]
*  Yeah, but that's why we're here. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3027.66s)]
*  Hang on, hang on, hang on. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3028.66s)]
*  That is fascinating. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3029.66s)]
*  So in other words, you don't mind doing the slur against Andrew [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3031.66s)]
*  over things he cares very passionately about religion [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3035.66s)]
*  because you don't share his religion. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3038.66s)]
*  Therefore, you can't offend him. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3041.66s)]
*  How is that a slur? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3043.66s)]
*  How is that a slur? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3045.66s)]
*  He said, would you use the word cannibal? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3046.66s)]
*  You said, yeah, you wouldn't care. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3047.66s)]
*  That's not a slur. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3048.66s)]
*  That's not a slur. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3049.66s)]
*  It is to him. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3050.66s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3051.66s)]
*  It is to him. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3052.66s)]
*  A slur was what offended people. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3053.66s)]
*  So, hang on, so Parker, you decide what... [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3055.66s)]
*  It's whatever offends is the slur of what? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3058.66s)]
*  Hang on, just to be clear, Parker, you are the slur monitor, are you? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3060.66s)]
*  You decide what isn't a slur. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3063.66s)]
*  And therefore, you, Parker, can say what the fuck you like, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3066.66s)]
*  as long as you have decided it's not a slur. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3070.66s)]
*  You see the flaw in the argument? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3074.66s)]
*  It's all ad hoc. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3076.66s)]
*  Obviously, we have definitions on what slurs are. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3077.66s)]
*  I don't know why that's a confusing thing to you. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3080.66s)]
*  Do you have a definition? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3082.66s)]
*  Obviously, you have a definition. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3083.66s)]
*  I would say, saying to a Christian... [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3084.66s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3086.66s)]
*  Saying to a Christian that he's a cannibal [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3087.66s)]
*  because of communion or whatever, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3089.66s)]
*  I think it's utterly offensive, yeah, and a slur. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3091.66s)]
*  But you don't, because you don't share the religion, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3094.66s)]
*  therefore, you, language monitor Parker, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3097.66s)]
*  have decided it's not a slur. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3100.66s)]
*  And so, as long as you don't think it's a slur, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3102.66s)]
*  and this is my problem with your generation, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3104.66s)]
*  is it you're so easily offended, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3106.66s)]
*  except when you're offending everybody else? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3108.66s)]
*  Wait, if it genuinely is the case that it leads to a particular level of harm [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3111.66s)]
*  that I would say meets my particular threshold of harm, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3114.66s)]
*  I would say we shouldn't use that term. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3116.66s)]
*  All I was doing is describing specifically, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3118.66s)]
*  there are terms and words Christians think are very harmful to them. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3120.66s)]
*  Well, cannibalism is a criminal offence. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3122.66s)]
*  Listen, listen, there's a lot more Christians... [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3124.66s)]
*  Cannibalism is a crime. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3126.66s)]
*  You're accusing them of being criminal. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3128.66s)]
*  No, actually, you're equivocating, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3131.66s)]
*  because I'm using their own definition of the term cannibal, specifically, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3132.66s)]
*  because it is the case that you're equivocating. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3135.66s)]
*  Because I don't think it's actually the body and blood of Christ, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3137.66s)]
*  so they didn't actually, in a meaningful sense, violate any laws. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3140.66s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3143.66s)]
*  And I don't think I'm actually calling somebody mentally slow [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3144.66s)]
*  when I say retard either, Parker, so what? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3148.66s)]
*  It still meets a particular threshold of harm that I could consider... [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3150.66s)]
*  Oh, OK, well, it meets a threshold of harm to me, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3153.66s)]
*  but you can't... [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3155.66s)]
*  All right, we've got to leave you there. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3156.66s)]
*  It's been a fascinating clash of... [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3158.66s)]
*  Andrew. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3159.66s)]
*  Hang on, have we got to leave it there? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3160.66s)]
*  It's been a great clash of cultures. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3161.66s)]
*  I think we should do this again. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3162.66s)]
*  I think both sides are learning from each other and beginning to bond. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3164.66s)]
*  Thank you all very much. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3168.66s)]
*  Come back without the mute button again, Parker. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3169.66s)]
*  OK, you can keep interrupting, buddy. You're so scared. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3172.66s)]
*  And we'll do it all for free. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3194.66s)]
*  Independent uncensored media has never been more critical [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3196.66s)]
*  and we couldn't do it without you. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNsCG7wUa2k&t=3199.66s)]
