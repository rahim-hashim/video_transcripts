Video Description: President Trump’s 90-day pause on most new tariffs was either a masterclass in The Art of the Deal or a panic-stricken climbdown, depending who you follow online - and the same camps are divided over Bill Maher, who has variously been described this weekend as a rabid MAGA convert and a sellout dupe for reporting on his dinner with the President.

If the 2028 election turns out to be Obama vs Trump, as Steve Bannon suggested, you can bet that Maher won’t be backing the President… but he’s also figured out that constantly defending the Democrats and smearing Trump isn’t working out very well, either.

As for the tariffs, if MAGA is as divided and furious about the trade war as we’ve been led to believe, nobody told the crowd at UFC in Florida this weekend…

Joining Piers Morgan to discuss all the above is founder and CEO of The Young Turks Cenk Uygur, analyst for Washington Post Intelligence Josh Rogin,  PBD Podcast’s angry patriot Vincent Oshana and author of ‘Plan Red: China’s Project to Destroy America’ Gordon Chang.

# “Let Him COOK!” 90-Day Tariffs Pause, Bill Maher’s Trump Dinner + UFC Ovation
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI)
*  China's steal is somewhere in the neighborhood of a half trillion dollars a year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=0.0s)]
*  We ignored Osama bin Laden and then we said, how did that happen? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3.84s)]
*  Well, we can't afford to do that with China because China is so much more powerful than Al-Qaeda ever was. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=8.0s)]
*  We don't need this weirdo militaristic talk about China. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=13.44s)]
*  And I don't want to get into a war with China. That's mental. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=16.96s)]
*  Chang, just because we're not shooting guns and dropping bombs doesn't mean we're not at war with China, bro. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=19.68s)]
*  Trust me, they're poisoning the minds of the kids with their freaking TikTok crap. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=25.52s)]
*  They sent fentanyl through our freaking border. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  How much more signs do you need to say that they are the enemy? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=30.64s)]
*  Is there anybody else that has a walk-in? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=34.48s)]
*  I mean, people are waking up, Piers. I don't think they're necessarily bending the knee. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=37.6s)]
*  It's like America is just fed up and they're just tired of the nonsense. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=40.64s)]
*  Good for Bill Maher. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=45.28s)]
*  People are being rounded up for their ideas and that's new and that's chilling. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=46.16s)]
*  No, this is all a protection of Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=50.64s)]
*  And once you take away his rights, you're taking away our rights. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  And that's it. Round them up. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=57.52s)]
*  There are no half measures in today's febrile public square. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  President Trump's 90-day pause on most new tariffs was either a master class in the art of the deal [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=64.08s)]
*  or a panic-stricken climb down. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=70.0s)]
*  It depends on who you follow online and what you watch. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=72.08s)]
*  And the same camps are divided over Bill Maher, who has variously been described this weekend [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  as a rabid MAGA convert and a sellout dupe for reporting on his dinner with the president like this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=80.4s)]
*  He's much more self-aware than he lets on in public. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=87.92s)]
*  I'm just taking it as a positive that this person exists [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=91.36s)]
*  because everything I've ever not liked about him was, I swear to God, absent. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=95.28s)]
*  I never felt I had to walk on eggshells around him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  And honestly, I voted for Clinton and Obama, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=103.36s)]
*  but I would never feel comfortable talking to them the way I was able to talk with Donald Trump. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  That's just how it went down. Make of it what you will. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=111.28s)]
*  Well, the truth is exactly where he is, somewhere in the middle. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=114.16s)]
*  If the 2028 election is somehow Obama versus Trump, as Steve Bannon suggested in the same show, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=117.12s)]
*  you can safely bet that Bill Maher will not be backing the president. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  But he's also figured out that defending Democrats to the hilt of every cultural excess [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=126.08s)]
*  and constantly smearing Trump as a dangerous demagogue who can do no right [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=131.6s)]
*  isn't working out very well either. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=136.24s)]
*  As for the tariffs, there's no doubt that they have caused carelessness [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=138.16s)]
*  in the markets. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=141.6s)]
*  But there's also no doubt that many countries are now hurriedly negotiating [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=145.2s)]
*  new trade terms that will benefit the U.S. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=149.6s)]
*  And if Magheras is divided and furious about the trade war as we've been led to believe, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=151.68s)]
*  well, nobody told the crowd at UFC in Florida this weekend. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=157.2s)]
*  America, like by UFC CEO Dana White and others, Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=171.6s)]
*  Is there anybody else that has a walk in other than a fighter? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=181.68s)]
*  So nothing is black and white. Well, almost nothing. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  There are still things like Taylor Renz's fangirling over Luigi Mangione. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  You're going to see women, especially that feel like, oh my God, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=197.12s)]
*  Here's this man who's revolutionary, who's famous, who's handsome, who's young, who's smart. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=200.16s)]
*  He's a person that seems like this morally good man, which is hard to find. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Sorry, what? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=217.6s)]
*  Surely everyone with a brain or a heart or a modicum of compassion can agree that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  someone who executes a father of two as he walks down the street is not a morally good man. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=225.68s)]
*  Well, let's find out to debate all this and more. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=232.56s)]
*  I'm joined by Cenk Yuga, the founder and CEO of The Young Turks, by Josh Rogan, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  analyst for the Washington Post Intelligence, Vinny Ashana, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=239.84s)]
*  PBD's podcast Angry Patriot, and Gordon Chang, the author of Plan Red, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  China's Project to Destroy America. Well, welcome to all of you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=248.88s)]
*  Let me start with you, Cenk. Where are we with tariff gates? Because it seems to me the biggest [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  problem right now for the administration is not the principle of leveling tariffs, which can be [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=261.2s)]
*  debated, or the overarching philosophy behind it, which is that America should be doing more [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=267.2s)]
*  manufacturing. I think most people agree with that. The real problem is the constant mixed messaging [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=273.04s)]
*  from the top people at the White House is causing, I think, real uncertainty and real damage, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=279.44s)]
*  not least to Donald Trump's approval ratings on the economy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=285.76s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. There's really no argument about it. I mean, the folks that are saying art of the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=291.76s)]
*  deal are hilarious. And it can be proven very simply. So first, he does these global massive [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=296.08s)]
*  nuclear tariffs. So as you know, peers on this show, I said they'll never last. They're maniacal. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=304.08s)]
*  And I also said, as you're pointing out, that tariffs can be done right. They could be targeted [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=310.8s)]
*  and strategic based on industries or countries in specific. So then Donald Trump backpedals, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=314.8s)]
*  and you can tell it's a backpedal and not some sort of art of the deal because he got absolutely [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  nothing in return. So the 90-day pause was based on zero giveback from any other country. It's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=325.52s)]
*  because he had miraculously crashed the stock market and the bond market at the same time, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=334.64s)]
*  which was previously held unimaginable because one is supposed to go up while the other one goes [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=339.76s)]
*  down, but he managed to do both. And now China tariffs is super strong. Okay, exemptions for [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=344.4s)]
*  iPhones and electronics. Why? Because he hadn't thought it through. He hasn't thought through [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=350.64s)]
*  any of this. He's always doing this in a way that makes no sense at all. And by the way, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=355.76s)]
*  if you like tariffs and you like the idea of rebuilding manufacturing in this country, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=360.8s)]
*  Donald Trump just did massive damage to it because after this, who's going to want to do tariffs [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=364.24s)]
*  again? So there's absolutely no planning here. And then let's see how he negotiates, if he can [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=368.88s)]
*  negotiate with China at all, but it's done nothing but damage and gotten us no good returns so far. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=374.64s)]
*  Okay. Gordon Chang, your response to that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=381.28s)]
*  Well, yes, so far, but we're very early into this process. And yes, I don't like a lot of the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=386.88s)]
*  turbulence and a lot of the backtracking, but we got to see how this turns out. Remember, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=392.88s)]
*  with this 90-day pause, President Trump is going to be negotiating with a lot of countries. We're [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=398.32s)]
*  going to end up stitching trade deals with them and we're going to leave China out in the cold. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=404.08s)]
*  And China's never been there, or at least hasn't been there for decades. So I think this is a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=408.96s)]
*  fascinating process. It has actually a possibility of working and it's absolutely got to work. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=414.23999999999995s)]
*  President Trump knows what he needs to do. Now, he may not do it in the way we like, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=420.32s)]
*  but I think he's going to eventually get it done. So let's wait until the end of the process before [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=425.67999999999995s)]
*  making judgments about whether this works or not. All right. There are 90 days. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=430.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Josh, there are 90 days to negotiate with countries. According to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  people at the White House, they've already had a lot of countries get in touch to try and do [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=444.0s)]
*  new deals. Is it right to judge this now, or should we be a little bit more patient, notwithstanding [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=449.52s)]
*  the fairly reckless way that this has so far been rolled out? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=456.4s)]
*  Well, to be short, Beers, there is a lot of truth to the fact that all of these countries are coming [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=460.79999999999995s)]
*  to make deals with the Trump administration. They were doing it before. They'll continue to do it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=466.48s)]
*  And I'm rooting for the United States. And I think most Americans are rooting for the Trump [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=471.36s)]
*  administration to succeed. But it's impossible to ignore the fact that trade deals take months, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  if not years to negotiate. And negotiating 90 of them in 90 days is not only a precedent, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  it's basically fantastical. And will they get 10? Will they get 20? Will they get 30? I hope they [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=488.56s)]
*  get as many as they can. But what is the cost of that turbulence? What is the benefit versus the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=495.12s)]
*  price that we pay while we're subjecting our economy and all these other economies, by the way, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=501.92s)]
*  all these economies around the world that are so dependent on us to all of this suffering and pain [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=507.68s)]
*  while we change our policy this way and that way, it just has to be weighed against the perceived [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=512.96s)]
*  benefits. So it's complex. And I'm not saying that they won't succeed to some degree, but [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=519.6s)]
*  it's impossible to ignore the fact that the way that they're doing it is causing massive, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=525.52s)]
*  massive damage, not just to our economy. And I agree with Gordon that it's time to confront Chinese [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=529.36s)]
*  predatory and unfair trade practices across the board. But we get one shot at this. And I think [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=535.76s)]
*  isolating China is going to be really difficult, especially when China is increasing its relationship [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=542.32s)]
*  with all the countries around the world that we're also alienating at the same time. So, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=547.44s)]
*  yeah, it's not impossible that he could succeed, but it doesn't look good. It doesn't look good [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=551.36s)]
*  because of the way it's gone so far. We have to be honest about that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=555.9200000000001s)]

*  let's get straight to the point. Support for today's show comes from a business focused on [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=571.0400000000001s)]
*  a critical issue. Prosperity, US national debt, is at crisis levels. Inflation has made life more [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=574.88s)]
*  expensive for everybody. And the stock market is precarious. It's enough to make anyone's financial [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=580.8s)]
*  future feel grim. So what is the solution? Well, a simple one is to opt out of the chaos and invest [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=585.52s)]
*  in something solid and reliable, physical, gold and silver. And there's only one name you need to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=590.48s)]
*  remember, American Heart for Gold. This company has earned the trust of thousands of customers [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=596.0s)]
*  with an A plus rating in the Better Business Bureau and glowing reviews you can see for [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=600.96s)]
*  yourself. They offer an incredible range of gold and silver bars and coins that can be delivered [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=605.2800000000001s)]

*  service makes the whole process simple, secure and straightforward. American Heart for Gold is [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=616.96s)]
*  committed to getting the truth out there and giving you peace of mind in uncertain times. And if that [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=622.08s)]
*  wasn't enough, you'll get up to $15,000 worth of free silver when you make your first purchase [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=627.04s)]
*  and mention my name, Piers. So make the smart move. Call 866-692-2474 or text Piers. That's [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=632.24s)]
*  P-I-E-R-S-265532. That's 866-692-2474 or text Piers 265532. All the details are in the description. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  Now on with the show. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=653.28s)]
*  All right, Vinnie, look, you're a massive Trump-er. You were with him at the weekend at the USC and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=657.04s)]
*  we'll come to that in Florida where he got a roaring ovation. There's no doubt the country, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=661.68s)]
*  as always, with Trump is split where a lot of liberals are in complete raging fury about him. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=667.12s)]
*  And at the same time, in places like Florida, he can do no wrong. But I saw a poll on CNN this [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=673.4399999999999s)]
*  morning, which has actually been, you know, the polling they've been doing on him has been quite [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=681.2s)]
*  positive until now. But the polling on do Americans trust Trump on the economy and do they blame him [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=685.36s)]
*  or Biden for the state of the economy right now, they've never been worse for Trump. So now the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=693.36s)]
*  American people have moved from blaming Biden to now blaming Trump. And his own approval rating on [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=698.72s)]
*  the economy is plummeting pretty rapidly. Now, I know Trump well, as you do, and he won't like [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=705.04s)]
*  that. He won't like the fact that his economic polling is plummeting. So this has to work quite [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=711.92s)]
*  quickly, doesn't it? Yeah, Piers, I think, well, first of all, just him walking into the UFC, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=718.16s)]
*  like you said, we're going to get into, I've never seen anything like that. I mean, I saw Michael [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=726.16s)]
*  Jackson when I was a kid and it was at that level, but we'll get into that. But Piers, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=730.3199999999999s)]
*  here's my thing. Obviously, all we're going to hear is the fear mongering from the other side, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=734.64s)]
*  everything from the past eight years, when he first came in, it was we're going to go to war [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=738.96s)]
*  with Korea. He was a Russian asset. We're going to go to war. Everything is fear, magrant peers. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=743.04s)]
*  The guy hasn't been in for three months. Everybody needs to just relax. Just like Gordon said, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=747.52s)]
*  let it take time. And I have an analogy, Piers, our country, like, you know what a heroin addict, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=752.64s)]
*  when they finally stopped doing the heroin and they put them in a room, they're detoxing, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=757.68s)]
*  they're shaking, they're sweating, they're going through a bunch of, you know, bodies are convulsing. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=761.12s)]
*  That's what America is going through, Piers. We've been hooked on this freaking government, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=764.56s)]
*  everybody walking all over us, every country taking advantage of us. It's going to hurt for [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=769.1999999999999s)]
*  a little while, Piers, but guess what? The tariffs are going to work. Stock market jumped [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=772.9599999999999s)]
*  400 points today. Everybody needs to chill. And then Piers, by the way, how many factories [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=776.64s)]
*  are reopening? Steel jobs are coming back to America. The world is, Japan pledged a trillion [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=781.12s)]
*  dollars to come here. The UAE committed 1.4 trillion in 10 years. Saudi Arabia just lined [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=785.68s)]
*  up $600 billion, possibly hitting a trillion. It's not small talk. It's respect. And Cheng said, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=791.28s)]
*  it's not the art of the deal. This is exactly, exactly what it is. He knows how to play this [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=796.8s)]
*  freaking game. Now he doesn't have all the Russia and all the crazy shit happening around him. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  Just give him some time. Let it freaking, let him cook. Everything's going to be okay. You'll see. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=806.0799999999999s)]
*  Trust me. All right. Cheng, trust Vinnie. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=811.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, I definitely don't. No offense, Vinnie. So listen, what would have garnered trust is if he [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=818.4000000000001s)]
*  had done this in a rational way and said, here, here's the industries I'm protecting. Here's the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=825.5200000000001s)]
*  countries I'm targeting. And I'm going reciprocal. If China's got 20%, we're going to put 20% on them [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=829.6800000000001s)]
*  and it's non-negotiable, right? Or we're going to negotiate it down to zero so that we've got it fair [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  for both sides. But to do 145%, I mean, you might as well do a million percent. It doesn't make any [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=839.52s)]
*  sense. At that price, you can't sell any goods. So he's not thinking this through. He's doing this [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=844.8s)]
*  in a crazy way. And you guys are saying, hey, let's see how it plays out. It's only three months in. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=849.6s)]
*  I get it. And that's fair. And there's a long way to go with four years. But what you can't say at [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=853.92s)]
*  the same time is that it's worked so far. It hasn't. It did crash the stock market. It did [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=858.64s)]
*  crash the bond market and Donald Trump retracted those because he had crashed the markets. That's [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=863.6s)]
*  not part of any plan. That's just a giant screw up. And he got nothing in return. So you can say, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=869.6800000000001s)]
*  hey, maybe he'll get better later. And that's always true. Of course, right. But to say that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=875.36s)]
*  he's cooking now, no, he's cooked, not cooking. And so far he's done nothing, but absolutely [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=880.32s)]
*  bungled it and got nothing in return. But, but, but, but you expect, what do you expect in three [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=885.84s)]
*  months brother, it's gonna take time and it's gonna be ugly. China has owned our asses, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=892.16s)]
*  Trank, for how long? And the only thing I fear, Piers, the last time, cause listen, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=898.3199999999999s)]
*  at the end of the day, all these other countries are gonna bend the knee. China is our actual [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=903.0s)]
*  threat. When people say they're our adversary, no no, that's our enemy, okay Piers, it's [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=907.24s)]
*  freaking China. And the last time Trump tried to hold them accountable and we had a trade [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=912.48s)]
*  war with China, a virus mysteriously leaked out of a lab that we not only opened, we funded, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=917.7s)]
*  and the main guy behind the helm that this virus leaked from got a preemptive pardon [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=924.38s)]
*  and his hands were washed and he has no accountability. That's the only actual fear. Trump is the [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=929.1s)]
*  only one that is holding their freaking foot to the fire and I'm sorry Piers, and Josh, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=933.9000000000001s)]
*  you said at the beginning that I disagree when you said that people are hoping for the [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=939.1800000000001s)]
*  success. The majority of the people that I know on the left, Josh, hell no. They're [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=943.02s)]
*  like no, they want it to fail, they want it to burn, just so they can say it was Trump, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=946.9s)]
*  it was Trump. We told you, that's not America brother. We have the freaking president of [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=951.34s)]
*  the United States, he's the leader of the freaking free world, we have to back the guy. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=955.06s)]
*  I'm not saying blindly back whatever the hell that he's doing. Check, I have some stuff [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=958.38s)]
*  that me and you agree on that he's doing that I don't agree with, but when it comes to this [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=961.5799999999999s)]
*  bro, when it comes to China, that is the actual threat. They freaking, mind you, the past [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=965.62s)]
*  four years, they got away with everything. They were flying spy balloons, Piers, nobody [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=970.66s)]
*  said shit. They buy land at all of our military bases, nuclear missile bases in Mount St. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=974.74s)]
*  Montana, nobody says anything. They do whatever they want. And then when Xi comes to San Francisco, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=980.98s)]
*  he do some cleans the street, kisses his ass, it looked like freaking Beijing. We finally [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=986.2199999999999s)]
*  got a guy that's holding their foot to the fire. Like I said, it's gonna hurt, it's gonna [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=990.86s)]
*  be a little turbulent, but bro, the guy knows what he's doing. He's a freaking boss and [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=994.62s)]
*  he's a businessman. He's gonna be fine. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=998.78s)]
*  Yes, it will change. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1002.46s)]
*  The interesting thing about this, hang on, the interesting thing, Josh, it seems to me [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1003.46s)]
*  about this particular crisis is it's entirely self-inflicted quite deliberately by the president [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1008.66s)]
*  of the United States. This is not some existential disaster that's happened or a pandemic or [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1014.82s)]
*  whatever it may be or a terror attack or a war. This is entirely orchestrated by Donald [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1021.78s)]
*  Trump and his team quite deliberately. And I've got to say, we were both on the Bill [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1027.9s)]
*  Marshall and we'll come to that a little later on Friday, but every time I've ever interviewed [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1032.66s)]
*  Trump 40, 50 times, however many it is now, he's always gone on about China. And I don't [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1038.26s)]
*  think he's wrong. So it's an interesting crisis where it's entirely driven by Donald Trump. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1044.22s)]
*  He's done this quite deliberately. Most people, I think, agree with the overarching principle [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1049.3000000000002s)]
*  that America has been ripped off certainly by China for too long and that manufacturing [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1055.26s)]
*  has been allowed to migrate out of America for way too long and way too aggressively. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1061.8600000000001s)]
*  So everyone kind of agrees with why Trump is doing something dramatic. What the point [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1066.9s)]
*  of argument is, is the implementation of a policy to try and reverse this trend. And [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1072.5s)]
*  that's why it's interesting to me when Trump talks about we've got to take no hard medicine, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1079.66s)]
*  as Vinnie just said, you know, it's very early to assess whether this will work or not. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1083.34s)]
*  It could be that in 90 days time, the Trump team have negotiated a series of new, more [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1088.02s)]
*  advantageous trade deals with many countries. I'm sure that's likely to happen anyway. And [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1094.4599999999998s)]
*  it may be, we don't know, but it may be that China blinks, that actually China realizes [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1098.6599999999999s)]
*  it needs America more than America needs China. Yeah, I think there's a lot right in what [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1105.02s)]
*  you said. I've interviewed Trump for an hour on China alone. OK, and I wrote about this [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1111.3000000000002s)]
*  in my book. And here's what people really don't understand about President Trump in [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1116.0600000000002s)]
*  China is that President Trump's goal is not to decouple from China. President Trump's [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1119.8600000000001s)]
*  goal is to make a deal with China. OK, and that's not necessarily what everybody in his [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1124.66s)]
*  administration thinks. But if you ask him, if you listen to him closely, that's what [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1128.8600000000001s)]
*  he wants. And for him, all of these things are tactics to get to the negotiating table [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1133.0600000000002s)]
*  and make a deal with Xi Jinping, not to separate the United States from China, but to solve [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1137.74s)]
*  the unfair trade practices and keep going the engagement. That's what President Trump [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1142.5800000000002s)]
*  believes in his heart of hearts. I'm 100 percent sure of it. And people who are close to him [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1147.02s)]
*  know that. So what does that mean? That means that these are all tactics meant to bring [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1150.82s)]

*  Chinese will negotiate. And that will be a very painstaking process. That's exactly what [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1158.82s)]
*  happened in the first term before the pandemic. By the way, Vinny, I agree with you that the [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1163.3s)]
*  virus likely leaked from a lab based on a preponderance of the evidence, but I don't [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1168.58s)]
*  think it was intentional. OK, I think it was an accident. But that's not either here nor there. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1171.9399999999998s)]
*  To address what you're saying, Piers, you know, we have to understand that this is all about [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1176.26s)]
*  dealmaking for President Trump. And yet when I say I'm rooting for those deals to succeed, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1181.2199999999998s)]
*  I'm not representing liberals. I'm just a person. I'm independent. I'm not a liberal. I'm just me. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1186.5s)]
*  And what I'm saying is that when you look at what happened this weekend, even since we were on [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1190.8999999999999s)]
*  that show, Piers, we had exemptions for some of the things. Then there were no exemptions. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1195.22s)]
*  Then the exemptions were temporary. Then this Commerce Secretary said one thing and the trade [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1199.94s)]
*  representative said another thing. Then the president tweeted a third thing. That's no way [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1204.02s)]
*  to run a railroad. OK, we can't do that. This is going to be a very, very difficult thing to pull [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1208.18s)]
*  off if we're doing it competently. And when you have the three top officials in the United States [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1213.7s)]
*  saying three different things on the same day, even yesterday, that's just a recipe for [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1219.06s)]
*  undermining his own goal. Now, I may be about to shock you with this, but tallow is an exceptional [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1225.86s)]
*  moisturizer. The oil in our skin shares many of the same fatty acids as tallow, making it nearly [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1232.6599999999999s)]
*  impossible to beat. You can have silky soft skin, like me, with an all natural alternative. There's [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1238.1799999999998s)]
*  no fillers and it's much more than just a moisturizer. It can replace lotion, night cream, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1244.66s)]
*  wrinkle cream, neosporin and much more. It's powerful enough to heal your skin, but it's [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1250.5s)]
*  safe enough to spread on your toast. And if you're looking for natural solutions, what about your [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1256.42s)]
*  toothpaste? Van Man's Mint Bone Tooth Powder is packed with all the minerals and the nutrients [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1261.8600000000001s)]
*  needed to remineralize teeth. They use zero fluoride, SLS, glycerin and foaming agents. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1268.02s)]
*  The aim for all of Van Man Company's products is to be edible, especially those which are literally [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1275.86s)]
*  used in your mouth. Go to vanman.shop.slash.discount.slash.piers for 10% off. That's vanman.shop.slash.discount.slash.piers. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1281.62s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. Gordon, there's no doubt that mixed messaging is a real problem right now. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1293.7s)]
*  And Donald Trump has to get a grip of that. But you've written a lot and talked a lot extensively [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1301.54s)]
*  about the threat from China. For those who don't fully appreciate why it's such an existential [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1307.22s)]
*  threat potentially to America Incorporated, for want of a better phrase, just explain what China [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1313.7s)]
*  has been doing, particularly in relation to intellectual property rights, and then abusing [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1321.14s)]
*  the legal process in a way that is very advantageous to them and very [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1326.42s)]
*  unadvantagesous to people like United States of America. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1332.18s)]
*  Yeah, China steals somewhere in the neighborhood of a half trillion dollars a year, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1337.38s)]
*  you know, give or take a couple hundred billion dollars. That was the assessment from John [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1341.8600000000001s)]
*  Ratcliffe when he was director of national intelligence in 2020, just before he left office. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1346.8999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, this has been persistent. It's been going on for decades. And the issue really [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1353.3s)]
*  has been no American president has been willing to take the Chinese on on this particular topic [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1358.34s)]
*  until Trump in this term, not even Trump in the 45 years. It's Trump 47 who is really doing this. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1364.34s)]
*  The context for this is that the Chinese regime believes the United States is an existential [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1371.86s)]
*  threat. It believes that not because of anything that we say or do peers, but because of who we [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1377.3s)]
*  are. You have an insecure regime in Beijing is worried about the inspirational impact of [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1383.06s)]
*  America's values and form of governance on the Chinese people. So that means we will never have [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1388.02s)]
*  amicable relations with Beijing as long as the Communist Party rules it. That's not a conclusion [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1393.46s)]
*  that most people want to hear. It's not a conclusion that President Trump wants to hear. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1399.22s)]
*  But when he tried a trade deal with China in January 2020, just before the pandemic, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1403.46s)]
*  the phase one trade pact, it failed almost immediately because the Chinese violated it. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1409.14s)]
*  And they'll continue to violate it because they believe that they must destroy our country. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1415.14s)]
*  I don't like that conclusion. But unfortunately, we have got to face what the Chinese regime says [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1420.5s)]
*  and does. We ignored Osama Bin Laden. We ignored him until one day when he killed 2,977 Americans. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1426.42s)]
*  And then we said, how did that happen? Well, we can't afford to do that with China because [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1434.5s)]
*  China is so much more powerful than Al-Qaeda ever was. I mean, you're shaking your head, but why? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1439.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So China has ripped us off. They have a partner here in America that I'll get to in a [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1449.54s)]
*  second. But we don't need this weirdo militaristic talk about China. We could just keep it to [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1454.26s)]
*  economic competition and sometimes, by the way, economic cooperation. And look, guys, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1460.18s)]
*  we all seem to agree we need to deal with China over-tariffing us and getting an unfair advantage. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1465.54s)]
*  The right way to do that is to go reciprocal, to be tough, and to be consistent and not to wobble [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1472.5s)]
*  like Trump is doing. So look, you gain credibility through your actions. And, Piers, you know, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1478.42s)]
*  last week I said there's no way that these tariffs would last. And I was right. Of course, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1484.02s)]
*  these tariffs can't last because there's certain economic inevitabilities. You can't crash both [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1488.26s)]
*  markets at the same time. It doesn't work. So we've got to be strategic in how we deal with China. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1493.78s)]
*  And talking in militaristic terms and how they're the evil enemy doesn't help at all. It's just weird [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1498.74s)]
*  to stuff to me. So don't do anything in a way that pushes militaristic angles. So I don't want to get [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1503.62s)]
*  into a war with China. That's mental. So now, in terms of who's their partner here in America, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1510.58s)]
*  that's causing a lot of the problems that we never talk about. And that's our corporations. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1516.02s)]
*  Because remember, these trade deals are not written with China and U.S. representatives. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1520.5s)]
*  The U.S. representatives literally handed off to corporate lobbyists. Corporate lobbyists write [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1524.6599999999999s)]
*  these deals for us. And if you think about it, they don't have America's interests in mind. They [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1530.34s)]
*  have Apple's interests in mind. They have Intel's interests. They have all these corporations' [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1534.26s)]
*  interests. Why do you think that trade deals in the past have been so lopsided? Because both [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1538.34s)]
*  establishment Republicans and Democrats have said, yeah, we don't really care what happens to the [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1542.74s)]
*  manufacturing base or the average American worker. We just care about the donations that come in from [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1546.4199999999998s)]
*  all these corporations. So they just hand them off. And the corporations win by having that, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1550.6599999999999s)]
*  their stuff made cheaper in China and then selling it here. So corporate rule is one of the giant [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1556.1799999999998s)]
*  underlying problems that we never address. Because the corporations in America are not on our side. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1563.54s)]
*  They're on their side. So we've got to start writing these trade deals. And for God's sake, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1569.78s)]
*  with Trump, you can't have him jumping around like a maniac. You can say maybe he'll get better later. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1574.6599999999999s)]
*  But you have to live in the reality-based world. He screwed this up in the beginning. Now we're in [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1580.82s)]
*  a worse situation, not a better situation. Part of being tough is being strategic and smart about [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1584.74s)]
*  how you do it so that you can stay that course. Okay. I mean, the other thing, of course, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1590.82s)]
*  with Donald Trump is that... Yeah, quickly, Vanier. I was just going to say, Chank, just because we're [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1596.98s)]
*  not shooting guns and dropping bombs doesn't mean we're not at war with China, bro. Trust me, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1604.5s)]
*  they're poisoning the minds of the kids with their freaking TikTok crap. They sent fentanyl [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1609.46s)]
*  through our freaking border that's killing Americans. All right? They steal all of our... [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1612.8999999999999s)]
*  How much more signs do you need to say that they are the enemy? Just because there's no bullet shot [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1617.14s)]
*  doesn't mean they're not the enemy, Chank. And I think that attitude is the same attitude on why [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1622.42s)]
*  they've just been plowing us for all these years. Because we're like, nah, they're not a real threat, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1627.46s)]
*  bro. We were just pushed this thing, Russia. Russia's the threat. Putin this, Putin that. No, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1632.5800000000002s)]
*  no. It's Xi Jinping and their freaking country, bro. A freaking dictator, communist that treats [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1637.94s)]
*  its citizens like freaking slaves. All right, Chank? Like actual slaves. They have freaking [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1643.54s)]
*  slave work camps. And if you don't have this guy's picture up in your freaking house and they come [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1648.98s)]
*  in, you're finished. Your family disappears. All right, Chank? This isn't a guy to take lightly. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1653.06s)]
*  And Trump, like I said, is the only one that's going to step up and fight this guy. Period. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1658.5s)]
*  Done deal. Vinny, they have people named the Uyghurs. That's my last name. Uyghur Turks [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1663.22s)]
*  in concentration camps. I understand exactly how bad the Chinese government is, but we don't need [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1670.74s)]
*  to go to war with them for no reason. Let's do tough economic sanctions that make sense or tariffs [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1676.18s)]
*  that make sense or other economic measures that make sense that get parity and equality back for [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1682.5s)]
*  the American people. Let's not let our corporate goons write these deals in a way that advantages [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1689.38s)]
*  them and China and leaves out the average American. But we don't need to get militaristic even though [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1694.58s)]
*  they're a terrible regime. I understand exactly how terrible they are, but we don't have to [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1700.02s)]
*  constantly push towards military conflict. Very quickly, I just... Well, hang on. Hang on. Hang [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1704.26s)]
*  on. Hang on. Don't talk at once. The interesting thing, Chank, about that is that if you look at [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1711.86s)]
*  how aggressively China has been expanding its military in the last decade and you look at the [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1716.26s)]
*  jungle drums beating about a possible invasion of Taiwan and what the impact of such an invasion [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1723.46s)]
*  would have, not least on America, given the amount of stuff that America gets in from Taiwan, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1729.7s)]
*  you know, the big ultimate military test may well come if Xi Jinping tries his luck and goes [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1735.94s)]
*  into Taiwan to see what America does. And China now has a military that is massively bigger and [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1741.46s)]
*  expanding at a terrifying rate, frankly, to potentially take on the United States in a [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1748.66s)]
*  military conflict. So I do think there's a slight naivety about, well, you can part with two things [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1754.66s)]
*  apart. One can be an economic war. We shouldn't have to worry about the military. I think there [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1760.1000000000001s)]
*  are enough signs there to suggest that absolutely the world should be waking up to the potential [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1765.38s)]
*  military threat from China. And absolutely we should be fearful of an invasion of Taiwan. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1771.7s)]
*  So, Piers, you don't have to be naive about it. You don't have to say, hey, let's not prepare. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1777.46s)]
*  Should we be thoroughly prepared if China takes military action? Of course we should. Same is true [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1785.38s)]
*  of Russia. But we didn't have to get, you know, threatened to bring NATO all the way up to Russia's [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1791.54s)]
*  border. Nancy Pelosi didn't have to go to Taiwan to egg on the Chinese government. We are purposely [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1797.06s)]
*  pushing buttons in Russia and China that leads, and by the way, in the Middle East, that potentially [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1803.62s)]
*  leads to more war. Let's be prepared. Let's be tough. Let's make sure that they understand the [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1808.9799999999998s)]
*  consequences and let's deliver those consequences if they go to a military route. But if we push [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1814.1s)]
*  them to a military route or we try to get ahead of them, we're going to needlessly engage in [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1819.78s)]
*  military conflict that hurts all sides. There are two wider parts of this which I think [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1823.86s)]
*  play into something we discussed on Bill Ma, Josh, which got a lot of reaction, as you know. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1829.46s)]
*  One, of course, is Donald Trump's interactions with people and how he likes to bring people from [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1834.66s)]
*  the other side over to, you know, to dinner and meet with them and sit down with them and [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1840.5s)]
*  break bread and stuff, as he did with Bill Ma, as he has done with Kim Jong-un on a much bigger [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1846.58s)]
*  global scale, of course. And that plays into also his negotiating skills into how he navigates his [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1850.98s)]
*  relationships. But, Josh, just to ask you about the Bill Ma thing, what struck me as quite [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1858.42s)]
*  interesting about some of the reaction. You know, some people were cheering you on when you took on [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1862.26s)]
*  Bill Ma for saying you thought it was compromising to his journalistic integrity. I think it was a [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1866.9s)]
*  kind of overarching theme for doing what he did because Trump, you thought, was basically playing [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1872.02s)]
*  him. And other people were hammering you saying, well, isn't this exactly what Bill Ma was talking [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1876.98s)]
*  about in his monologue about the dinner he had with Kid Rock and with Bill Ma and with Dana White [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1883.78s)]
*  from UFC, obviously, and Donald Trump? We've now reached a stage where people can't even go and [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1889.7s)]
*  meet with people from across the political divide without the people on the other side or their side [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1895.94s)]
*  throwing their toys out of a stroller and screaming and saying how disgusting this is. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1902.66s)]
*  I was curious about your reaction to the reaction and whether you understood that. People were [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1908.26s)]
*  saying, well, this is exactly what Bill Ma is talking about. Yeah, no, I appreciate you giving [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1913.78s)]
*  me the chance to react to the reaction. I mean, first of all, I don't think I was questioning his [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1918.26s)]
*  journalistic integrity at all because I don't think he's a journalist and he's a comedian. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1923.22s)]
*  And the first thing I said was that this is a tempest in a teapot. And, you know, it's totally [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1928.26s)]
*  fine for people to go to meet with Trump and have dinner and that there is not, you know, that [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1933.22s)]
*  pretending that this is some sort of, you know, summit or some sort of big event is really [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1940.18s)]
*  not true. So I don't think I tried to go to pains to not to criticize Bill for going, but to also [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1945.7s)]
*  make a nuanced point, which may have been lost by both sides, actually. And the nuanced point is [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1952.18s)]
*  simply that from Trump's perspective, I question whether or not he was engaged in the genuine [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1957.3s)]
*  conversation for a seek for middle ground that Bill Ma was engaged in. And we can have two thoughts [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1963.78s)]
*  inside of our head. One is that Bill Ma went to meet with Trump to seek a middle ground and a [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1969.38s)]
*  conversation to bridge the political divide and, you know, heal the culture wars. And I believe Bill [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1973.38s)]
*  was trying to do that. And I'm skeptical that's what Trump was trying to do, because all of you [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1978.5s)]
*  know when you've met with Trump that that's always what he does. He tells when I interviewed [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1983.3s)]
*  Trump, the first thing he said to me was, Josh, you're the best reporter I've ever seen. And [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1988.1s)]
*  you're the you know, the stuff he had no idea who I was. But this is what he does. He charms you and [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1992.6599999999999s)]
*  he tries to get you on his side. And then he tries to get you to tell whoever you're going to tell [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=1997.62s)]
*  about the meeting that, oh, he's not that bad after all. And of course, that's exactly what [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2001.86s)]
*  happened. So I don't agree with people who say meeting him is some sort of bad thing. But I also [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2005.22s)]
*  don't agree with the people who say that somehow meeting with him is going to produce a good result. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2010.98s)]
*  It's essentially a non-event. And if we can sort of think of it as a PR stunt that, you know, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2016.02s)]
*  had some cost and some benefit, some benefit in that, oh, well, we can sit together and have a [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2023.14s)]
*  meal together and some cost in that you gave Trump this opportunity to put you on display and say, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2028.9s)]
*  look, even Bill Maher is OK with me, then we can agree that there is a cost and a benefit. And [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2035.6999999999998s)]
*  people who are saying don't meet with him are wrong. And people are saying meeting with him [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2041.9399999999998s)]
*  is going to do something are also wrong. And that was the nuance that I was trying to get across on [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2045.78s)]
*  the show. But, you know, I feel like maybe in that moment, Bill felt that I was attacking him. I [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2049.22s)]
*  wasn't. I was, you know, I was trying to praise him. And that kind of seemed to make him a little [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2056.8199999999997s)]
*  even more upset. But, you know, what are you going to do? Well, I thought it was a ballsy move to [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2061.14s)]
*  whack him off the top. But what also struck me was that is there a slight hypocrisy? And only your [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2067.2999999999997s)]
*  answer will reveal whether there is here. You work for the Washington Post. Your owner, Jeff Bezos, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2074.9s)]
*  has done a lot more than Bill Maher in crossing the divide with Trump. He used to be very critical [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2080.98s)]
*  of Trump. But in the last year and a half or so, or since his shooting, actually, he seems to [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2086.18s)]
*  performed a massive U-turn on Trump. He called him and praised him after he was shot at a New York [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2092.1s)]
*  Times event in December. Bezos said he was optimistic about a second Trump presidency. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2100.42s)]
*  He had dinner at Mur-a-Lago in December 2024. He pledged a million dollars to Trump's inauguration [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2104.9s)]
*  fund. He attended the inauguration. Amazon, obviously one of his companies, main company, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2111.22s)]
*  streamed Trump's inauguration on its Prime Video service and is also paying $40 million for a [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2118.18s)]
*  Melania Trump documentary. I mean, as a Washington Post senior journalist, how do you feel about all [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2123.8599999999997s)]
*  that? Yeah, well, again, I don't think I, again, I wasn't trying to criticize Bill. And if it came [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2129.9399999999996s)]
*  off that way, then maybe I didn't craft my critique perfectly. I was trying to criticize [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2136.5s)]
*  the idea that engagement with Trump is some sort of bridge towards healing the cultural divide, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2143.3s)]
*  because I just don't think that's going to be the result. And I think when business leaders go to [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2150.82s)]
*  meet with Trump, that's a different set of calculations. And I work at the Washington Post. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2154.9s)]
*  I'm not privy to what goes on at the ownership level. I just work there. I'm not part of the [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2158.42s)]
*  management. I'm not part of the ownership. I've never met Jeff Bezos. I don't know what his [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2164.9s)]
*  calculations are. And I know that's above my pay grade, Piers. It's not a duck. It's just I don't [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2169.46s)]
*  have any insight into what goes on above me at the Washington Post. All I can say is that [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2174.34s)]
*  I'm not against engagement. And I understand that Trump is the president and business leaders have [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2178.98s)]
*  to engage with the president. And the way that they do it matters. That's how I feel about it. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2184.02s)]
*  And, you know... [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2188.82s)]
*  All right. But look, Josh, Josh, look, if it looks like a duck and it sounds like a duck, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2190.82s)]
*  it's probably a duck. I mean, you can appreciate that if you're Bill Maher watching you refusing [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2196.1000000000004s)]
*  to be remotely critical of what your own owner has done with Trump in terms of kissing the ring, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2201.78s)]
*  you could potentially see that he might think there's a double standard there. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2208.7400000000002s)]
*  No, I see what you're trying to do, Piers, but I'm not in a position to comment on Jeff Bezos, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2213.2200000000003s)]
*  because if I comment on Jeff Bezos, then I could be fired from my job. And you know that. So you [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2219.06s)]
*  could... I'm not going to do that. But at the same time, I want to be honest with you. So I don't [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2224.42s)]
*  seem to be dodging your question. And my honest answer from my heart is, you know, every person [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2230.1s)]
*  that engages with this administration, including all the people on this panel, including you, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2236.02s)]
*  including me, has to make that judgment based on their own calculations and their own values and [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2239.46s)]
*  interests. And we have to be careful not to judge each other for where we all come down [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2244.82s)]
*  on that. And, you know, that's the best answer I can give you, being honest without losing my job [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2250.34s)]
*  and also being true to what I think is very consistent, which is the same approach I had [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2255.38s)]
*  to Bill Maher, which is engagement is good and the way that you do it matters. And your expectations [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2260.6600000000003s)]
*  of Trump's response should be very limited. And that's my effort to answer you honestly, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2265.6200000000003s)]
*  Piers, without getting fired from my job and without... But to try to prove to you that I do [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2270.34s)]
*  have a very consistent philosophy on this, which is not going to please the Trumpsters and is not [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2275.94s)]
*  going to please the liberals because I'm neither a Trumpster nor a liberal. OK, check. You're [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2280.9s)]
*  smirking a bit there. Are you buying the Josh I'm not ducking it Rogan response there? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2286.9s)]
*  No, I have sympathy for the brother. I understand the situation he's in, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2295.38s)]
*  but I disagree with him on both counts. I think that you shouldn't be overly naive, of course, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2298.74s)]
*  going to talk to Trump. You shouldn't be naive at all, but you also shouldn't be overly cynical. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2304.5s)]
*  So naive is I'm going to go talk to Trump and he's instantly going to change his mind and agree with [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2308.8999999999996s)]
*  me. Of course, that's not going to happen, right? But cynical is, oh, there's no value in talking [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2313.4599999999996s)]
*  to the other side. There's no value in talking to the U.S. president. You just shouldn't do it at all. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2319.2999999999997s)]
*  You should just you don't platform him. That's exactly what I'm saying. Commander in chief. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2323.78s)]
*  Yeah. So so like, of course, Bill should go to talk to him. I would go to talk to him in a second, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2329.86s)]
*  but I wouldn't go in there thinking like, oh, I've got some sort of magical answer and Trump's going [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2335.38s)]
*  to now come out of progressive or an actual populist rather than a fake populist. But does [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2339.7000000000003s)]
*  it make sense to try to bridge the divide? Hell yeah, it does. So look, look at, you know, so I [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2345.46s)]
*  go on Patrick B. Davis show that Vinny is on from time to time, and sometimes we yell at each other [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2350.58s)]
*  and a lot of times we vehemently disagree, but sometimes we find agreement like Vinny and I have [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2356.34s)]
*  on Israel and a couple of other issues. So, hey, we bridge the divide there. You know what? Not only [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2361.2999999999997s)]
*  did it help on that particular issue, but it starts to heal a little bit. And I know the people on my [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2366.1s)]
*  side in particular don't want to hear that. And so others have gone on the same show and thought the [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2371.7799999999997s)]
*  great strategies to just yell the entire time at them. Right? But then you're not listening. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2376.1s)]
*  You're not actively engaging and you're not repairing any bonds. And for this country, and I [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2381.22s)]
*  know, know like, again, the cynics hate this kind of talk, but at some point we have to heal the bonds [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2386.2599999999998s)]
*  and it starts with simple conversations. And if you can't speak to the president of the United States [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2392.58s)]
*  because you're so bitter and mad about it, that's not at all productive and it doesn't go towards [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2397.46s)]
*  healing any bonds. It's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take a long, long time, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2402.18s)]
*  but we should at least have the decency to talk and to listen to one another. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2406.8999999999996s)]
*  I think that's essentially exactly what I was trying to say. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2412.5s)]
*  Yeah, Vinny, you were at the UFC thing. I was struck by the incredible ovation that Trump got [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2416.98s)]
*  there. There's no doubt that in vast swathes of America, he's not just popular. You know, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2423.62s)]
*  it's a gigantic kind of superstardom, fandom that goes on with his fan base. And yet there are other [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2430.7400000000002s)]
*  parts of America that completely detest everything Trump says and does. How do we bring these two [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2437.78s)]
*  factions together? How does the United States of America become more united? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2445.3s)]
*  I think, and Chank made a good point, Josh made a good point, and you make a good point, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2453.86s)]
*  it's like enough of this. I was having a conversation before I came to the van, this whole [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2458.1800000000003s)]
*  left, right, your side, my side, your side of the aisle, my side. I'm a Christian and I read the [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2462.42s)]
*  Bible every single day. I'm trying to learn. I'm trying to be a better person. I'm trying to walk [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2469.1400000000003s)]
*  in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. The two main things in the Bible is love God with all your [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2472.82s)]
*  heart, your soul and your mind and love your neighbor. It's that simple. We're supposed to [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2478.34s)]
*  love each other. Okay. I mean, it's not easy, Piers, when the mainstream media for all this [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2484.02s)]
*  time is saying that this guy is this evil monster, Hitler, all this stuff. That doesn't help. It [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2488.1s)]
*  hasn't helped. And that's why all these big networks, all these freaking mainstream medias [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2494.58s)]
*  are on decline. You mentioned Jeff Bezos. You no wonder why he's changed his tune, Piers. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2499.06s)]
*  They lost over 250,000 digital subscribers. The traffic dropped from 22.5 million to 2.5 [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2503.78s)]
*  to 3 million, lost $100 million in 2004. All right. He blocked the Kamala Harris endorsement. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2510.9s)]
*  I mean, people are waking up, Piers. I don't think they're necessarily bending the knee. It's like [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2517.2200000000003s)]
*  America has just fed up and they're just tired of the nonsense, Piers. And I'm proud. Good for [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2520.82s)]
*  Bill Maher. All right. First of all, Trump didn't ask for the meeting, Piers. Kid Rock was like, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2526.58s)]
*  you know what? You should meet with him. Would he meet with me? Yes. Boom. A comedian, just like [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2530.7400000000002s)]
*  myself, was in the White House with the president of the United States. A guy, Bajoo, two, one talk [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2535.46s)]
*  crap about the other, other one goes back. Bill Maher has been going at this guy forever. It's [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2542.9s)]
*  starting to ease up, Piers. It's like, by the way, this guy's going to be gone in less than four [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2547.38s)]
*  years. Okay? Like this, just, everybody needs to just calm down and love each other. Stop listening [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2552.58s)]
*  to all this rhetoric and this hate because they divide and they conquer, Piers. That's what that, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2558.5s)]
*  the goal forever has been divide and conquer. But we are all brothers. We are all sisters. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2562.5s)]
*  We're supposed to love each other and not let this evil, evil, because that's what it is, Piers, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2567.86s)]
*  keep us all separated and fighting each other. Just on that point about Trump gone in four years, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2572.5s)]
*  Steve Bannon was also on Bill Maher and said he's definitely going to run for another term. So [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2578.74s)]
*  liberals may not get up, get away from Trump quite as early as they hoped. And let me bring Gordon, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2583.22s)]
*  I want to change subject with you to these two big deportation stories, one involving this El [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2588.1s)]
*  Salvadorian, Kilmar Garcia, who's been sent to a prison in El Salvador, the country where he's [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2595.06s)]
*  come from. Now, he was residing in the United States. He was an illegal immigrant, but he was [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2602.3399999999997s)]
*  married in the United States with three children, all with special needs. He has always emphatically [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2608.1s)]
*  denied being a member of this gang, MS-13, despite the authorities believing that from one source, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2614.74s)]
*  I understand, that they think he may have been. There's certainly been no sign of him involved [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2622.2599999999998s)]
*  in any MS-13 gang activity that anyone has brought forward as hard evidence. And in 2019, although he [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2628.74s)]
*  was on a list to be deported, I believe, his lawyers argued successfully that his life would [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2636.18s)]
*  be in danger if he was sent back to El Salvador from other gangs who had threatened him previously. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2642.5s)]
*  What is your view of this? I mean, are you comfortable with America sending people from [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2648.66s)]
*  the United States to an El Salvadorian prison? And given they've accepted this appears to have been [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2654.34s)]
*  an administrative error in sending him because of this order in place not to send him back. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2659.7s)]
*  Why do they not just pick the phone up, the administration, to El Salvador's president and [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2665.22s)]
*  get him back? Well, they should because this was apparently a mistake and the administration has [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2670.98s)]
*  not shown reason for it other than they made a mistake. But let's not, you know, and the broader [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2677.94s)]
*  issue it's going to be the United States needs to deport substantial numbers of people who came into [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2684.18s)]
*  our country with false asylum claims. Some of them are really dangerous, as we saw with the gangs that [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2690.66s)]
*  were attacking the homes in Aurora, Colorado. But from my perspective in China, we know that [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2696.34s)]
*  a certain number of Chinese migrants are either Ministry of State Security agents or they are [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2703.46s)]
*  People's Liberation Army officers or soldiers. And they have come in here for no good because [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2709.86s)]
*  we are seeing this increased tempo of incursions and attempted incursions in our military bases, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2716.1800000000003s)]
*  these drone flights, all the rest of it. This is extremely disturbing because they've come here [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2722.1s)]
*  to attack us. They're looking at our patterns, they're looking for our vulnerabilities, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2726.8199999999997s)]
*  and they are ready to strike. So yes, we do need to deport a substantial number of people [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2731.7s)]
*  because this is a matter of national survival. And yes, the Trump administration should admit [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2738.5s)]
*  it made a mistake in this particular case and bring him back. There's no question about that. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2743.86s)]
*  Yes, I mean, Cheng, the other case is the Mahmoud Khalil case, who was the head of this very [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2748.58s)]
*  aggressive pro-Palestinian group at Columbia University who was sort of leading the mob, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2757.54s)]
*  as we saw at the time, who was seen reportedly distributing pro-Hamas literature. Now, he's there [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2762.66s)]
*  on a green card in the United States, which has different rules of due process, it turns out, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2771.22s)]
*  because if you are there on a green card, and Josh and I discussed this on Bill Ma, but there [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2776.42s)]
*  is a difference in how you're treated in terms of due process to an American citizen. And it seemed [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2782.26s)]
*  to me, and the argument I made on Bill Ma was, if this guy had repeated exactly what he believes [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2788.58s)]
*  about wanting the destruction of Western civilization, about distributing pro-Hamas literature, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2795.06s)]
*  etc. If he'd done all that at his interview for his green card, he would have been rejected [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2801.62s)]
*  a green card to come into the United States. So by that principle, why should the United States [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2807.06s)]
*  not be able to deport him, as indeed, it appears they have the legal authority to do so? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2812.82s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, I don't stipulate to any of your facts. I don't believe they're facts at all. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2819.3s)]
*  They've never been proven in court. They've never even been shown in court. They're just BS that the [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2823.7s)]
*  Trump administration is throwing out. There's two different issues here. One is, how do you do the [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2828.1s)]
*  deportations? And if you're in favor of the deportations, then you should be upset at Donald [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2833.7799999999997s)]
*  Trump, because he's doing the cause of deporting criminals that are undocumented from here harm [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2838.66s)]
*  by overstepping for no reason. So this Garcia guy was, they even admitted in court, sent there by [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2845.38s)]
*  error. So why don't you bring him back? Why are you insisting on sending the wrong guys [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2851.86s)]
*  to the dungeon in El Salvador? Why are you even insisting on sending people to a dungeon in El [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2859.1400000000003s)]
*  Salvador? That doesn't make any sense. We have perfectly good prisons here. We could deport people. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2864.1800000000003s)]
*  So I'm not telling you not to deport MS-13 or the Venezuelan gang. I'm telling you to go ahead and [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2869.06s)]
*  deport them. Just don't deport people that aren't in that gang. So we're asking for just bare minimum [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2874.5s)]
*  due diligence and due process, which is really, really important, because that isn't about the [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2880.74s)]
*  immigrants. That's about our constitution. And our constitution does apply to naturalized citizens. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2885.2999999999997s)]
*  In fact, it applies to every person that's here. Yes, there's some votes, rights like voting that [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2890.74s)]
*  doesn't apply to green card holders, but the Supreme Court has said for 200 years, the First [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2896.3399999999997s)]
*  Amendment applies to them, which brings us to the second issue. Why are we snatching up critics of [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2900.66s)]
*  Israel? Not even America, not any other country, not any other religion, not anything but beloved, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2905.86s)]
*  sacred Israel, and having mass men grab them off the streets for writing an op-ed against Israel, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2912.82s)]
*  talking about economic sanctions and boycotts, not anything militaristic, not anything related [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2920.1s)]
*  to terrorism. So notice no critic of China or Russia or America is getting rounded up. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2925.86s)]
*  Only critics of Israel are getting rounded up. And that's just a stone cold fact. So I don't like [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2932.02s)]
*  Israel running this country, which is obviously what's happening. I'm sick of it when Biden sent [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2938.58s)]
*  blank check after blank check to do the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians. And now Trump says, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2944.1s)]
*  hold my beer. I could do even better. I'm just going to, any critic of Israel, I'm going to trash [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2948.7400000000002s)]
*  the First Amendment. He was theoretically for freedom of speech. This has canceled culture on [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2953.46s)]
*  steroids where a foreign government cancels people inside this country because they dared to [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2958.66s)]
*  criticize Israel. It's totally, utterly unacceptable. And it's destroying our [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2963.7s)]
*  constitution on behalf of a foreign government. Totally unacceptable. All right, Vinny, I can see [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2969.14s)]
*  you ready to let rip. Josh, I'll come to you in a moment. But Vinny, I can see you simmering like [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2975.8599999999997s)]
*  a volcano there. Yeah. Well, well, first things first, Piers, when it comes to the deportations [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2981.2999999999997s)]
*  and the how do we get here? How do we get to the point where we have to reverse and send illegal [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2988.58s)]
*  gang members to get the hell out of our country is because the Biden administration with Alejandro [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2993.7s)]
*  Mayorkas literally let a freaking invasion of the country happen with zero accountability. Okay. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=2998.58s)]
*  Cause he got a pre pardon too. Let's move on to that. You mean to tell me out of the thousands [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3003.94s)]
*  and thousands that Homeland security with Thomas Holman and Kristi Noem that we've deported these [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3008.58s)]
*  freaking murderous gangsters, we have one guy, one guy that nobody on this panel knows, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3013.7s)]
*  because none of us have the actual inside scoop is a freaking gang member. And why is he fearing [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3020.66s)]
*  for his life in another place by other gangs? Could it be that he isn't a freaking gang? All [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3026.18s)]
*  right. None of us know. Okay. None of us know the thing, but if it's one and we're asking Piers, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3030.3399999999997s)]
*  why haven't they called and try to get this guy out? Maybe he was in a gang. Okay. Let's think [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3034.8199999999997s)]
*  about that and go into Chanks point, uh, Chank, you know, I'm with you, brother America. If you're [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3040.98s)]
*  an American freedom of speech, first amendment, you could talk all the shit you want whenever you [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3046.18s)]
*  want about anything. Cause it's an app. I'm a free speech absolutist, but if you are here, uh, Chank [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3051.78s)]
*  and you're here on a green card to try to come here and learn and listen, I'm sorry, Chank, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3057.62s)]
*  you're handing out pro Hamas shit and you're trying to rally the troops and try to get people [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3062.98s)]
*  angry. And here's my thing. Piers talk first amendment all you want. If you're hitting [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3067.14s)]
*  and fucking abusing Jewish students, I'm sorry, Chank. That shit doesn't fly with me at all. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3071.8599999999997s)]
*  That's a crime. Okay. But Vinny, he didn't do that. He didn't do that. That's a crime. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3078.3399999999997s)]
*  If you hit a Jewish student, of course you're a goner. Yeah. But Chank, I'll get it. Chank, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3084.5s)]
*  he was, he was, but Chank, he was the, hang on. He was the leader of a protest group who, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3090.1s)]
*  and who are on record as saying they want the destruction of Western civilization. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3096.66s)]
*  Now, can you imagine saying that's what you want at a green card interview and being allowed to [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3101.38s)]
*  become an American green card holder? No, absolutely not. But so, so Piers, here's what's happening. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3107.3s)]
*  So these guys criticize and lead protests against Israel. So then our government goes on a fishing [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3116.34s)]
*  expedition also by the way, by some vigilante pro Israel groups that go around taking their pictures, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3121.86s)]
*  looking at their social media, scouring it and trying to find anything where they can say, well, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3127.54s)]
*  he wants us connected to a group that one guy in the group said this and this and this. So, oh no, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3132.82s)]
*  no, no, this isn't about criticism of Israel, which it 100% is. Oh, this is because, oh, he did [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3138.1800000000003s)]
*  this wrong or a guy he knew that knew a guy did something wrong or said something wrong. No, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3143.7s)]
*  this is all a protection of Israel. And once you take away his rights, the Supreme Court is very, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3148.58s)]
*  very, very clear. You're taking away our rights. And then Vinny, you'll be arrested for saying what [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3154.2599999999998s)]
*  you say about Israel and I'll be arrested and we'll all be deported. I don't want to give him [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3160.02s)]
*  my first amendment rights for Israel or any other country period, full stop. I'm not interested in [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3165.06s)]
*  the witch hunts. Oh, us church, she wrote an op-ed. Okay. Her life. What did she say when she was 13? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3171.14s)]
*  Israel's feelings have been hurt. Get real on what's happening here. A different government [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3177.3799999999997s)]
*  is running our government. I just want to very quickly. I'm going to come to Josh, but just to [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3182.66s)]
*  be, I'll come to Josh. One second, Josh. I'll come to you. Just to be clear, though, there is a big [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3187.3799999999997s)]
*  difference between being an American citizen and being a green card holder. I think it's not lost [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3193.06s)]
*  on you, Shane. You don't need to have committed a crime to have your green card revoked. The [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3198.42s)]
*  secretary of state Marco Rubio has been told he's perfectly in his rights to deport Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3203.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think you're being extremely naive about what his involvement was in those protests in [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3208.9s)]
*  Colombia. He was the leader. He was the leader. He was the leader. He was the leader of the protest [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3214.42s)]
*  group there who committed multiple acts of violence and vandalism who were harassing and [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3224.02s)]
*  terrorizing Jewish students. And that group is on the record as saying some stuff which if you [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3229.3s)]
*  repeated, and he was the leader, if you repeated that stuff at your green card meeting, you wouldn't [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3234.74s)]
*  get a green card. In other words, not him. Guilt by association. Not him, guilt by association. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3240.66s)]
*  None of that is true on Eurster. The one thing that's true is that every person being investigated [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3245.7s)]
*  is a critic of Israel. That's the one thing that's the connective tissue. And this is super [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3250.9s)]
*  important, Piers. You guys are legally and constitutionally wrong. So the 1952 law does [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3255.46s)]
*  give Rubio the theoretical power that you're talking about. But the constitution has been [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3260.34s)]
*  interpreted by the Supreme Court for 200 years to apply the First Amendment and the constitution [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3265.3s)]
*  to resident aliens like green card holders. So that means those things are in conflict. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3269.7000000000003s)]
*  And what the Supreme Court has to eventually decide is, is this law unconstitutional, which [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3274.7400000000002s)]
*  it most certainly is. It's definitely unconstitutional. Yes, but, Cenk, it's not a [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3279.46s)]
*  First Amendment issue. That's the point. If you're supporting a prescribed terrorist organization, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3286.02s)]
*  the First Amendment is in conflict with the 1952 law. Those conflicts are resolved by the courts. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3291.86s)]
*  You just simply don't understand the law. I do, but if you support a prescribed terror group in [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3298.1s)]
*  the United States as a green card holder, you can be deported. That's the point you're not getting. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3304.42s)]
*  Let me bring Josh in here. Josh, how many people did Barack Obama deported? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3308.74s)]
*  Oh golly gee, she's a critic of Israel. She got deported. She got rounded up anyway. And [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3312.8999999999996s)]
*  he did so many others. But hey, every critic of Israel is rounded up. Coincidentally. And then I [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3317.7s)]
*  found a cousin of an uncle of an aunt who once said something mean about Israel. And that's it. Round [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3322.66s)]
*  them up. Okay, get real. Are you guys all pretending that this isn't on the orders of Israel? Are you [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3327.7799999999997s)]
*  all pretending that Israel didn't order Trump to do this? Go ahead and pretend. Go ahead. I can't [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3333.3s)]
*  wait for you to pretend. I have a question. No, I have a question. Talking of rounding people up, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3340.1000000000004s)]
*  I have a question for you, Josh. How many people did Barack Obama round up and deport in his eight [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3346.6600000000003s)]
*  years as president? Do you know? Off the top of my head, no. Is that the question? Have a guess. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3354.34s)]
*  Number at my fingertips, I'm sure it was over a million people. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3361.46s)]
*  Two million. Okay. It was actually three million, over three million people, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3365.94s)]
*  which is more pro rata per year than any president in the history of the United States. He was known [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3370.42s)]
*  as the deporter in chief in Mexico. So yeah, by Cenk's rounding up claim, he was rounding up [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3376.42s)]
*  pretty much everybody could get his hands on and throwing them out of the country. And what did I [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3383.14s)]
*  hear from the left? Absolutely nothing. Nobody even knows how many on the left that Obama deported. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3388.42s)]
*  They didn't care. It's only become an issue with Trump. And I would say that on the Trump [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3396.42s)]
*  deportation issue, look at what's happened on the southern border already. In under three months, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3401.54s)]
*  Donald Trump has pretty much totally stopped the number of people coming over the southern [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3407.2200000000003s)]
*  border illegally from the millions that were doing it every year in the four years of Biden's [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3413.22s)]
*  administration. That's an incredible achievement, which no one's talking about. So no one on the [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3418.58s)]
*  left talks about Obama's deportation record because it doesn't suit their agenda. No one on the left [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3423.14s)]
*  is giving Trump any praise what's happened on the southern border. And on the rounding up issue, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3427.9399999999996s)]
*  again, and Josh, I'll let you respond to this, but you know, Cenk is just fundamentally wrong [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3433.06s)]
*  about the difference in which the First Amendment is at play, not because it doesn't apply to [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3438.5s)]
*  everyone. It does. It applies to me if I'm in the United States. It's not a First Amendment issue [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3444.1s)]
*  if you are supporting a terror group period. Right. Okay. So now a few things. What does it mean to [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3448.42s)]
*  support a terror group? First of all, I think they're not, I'm not speaking for the left. I'm [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3454.98s)]
*  just speaking for me. And I think the big difference with the Trump deportations is that people are [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3460.02s)]
*  being rounded up for their ideas, and that's new, and that's chilling, and that's something that we [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3463.94s)]
*  have to think about and reckon with. And that is the important difference. And then, you know, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3469.2200000000003s)]
*  to Cenk, I would say, listen, they're not only rounding up anti-Israel people. I, as a, not as [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3474.58s)]
*  a Jew, but as a human being and as an American, I don't want to see anti-Semitism in the fight [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3480.1s)]
*  against anti-Semitism used, weaponized to erode people's civil liberties. That offends me as a [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3484.02s)]
*  Jew, as a human being, and as an American. But it's not just the anti-Israel protesters. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3489.62s)]
*  There are Chinese citizens who are being deported. There are Russian citizens who have been sent back [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3493.8599999999997s)]
*  to very cruel fates who are against the Putin regime, who are now no choice but to go back. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3498.2599999999998s)]
*  And just yesterday, they sent thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. military for 20 years, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3503.94s)]
*  who were in the process of securing what we promised them, which was safety from the Taliban [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3510.1s)]
*  by being able to live here. We brought them here and we put them through a process. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3515.06s)]
*  And they got an email saying, get out in seven days, okay, thousands of them. And all of my [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3519.22s)]
*  sources in the military community are aghast, Republican and Democrats, because these people [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3525.06s)]
*  sacrificed and worked for our freedom, whether or not you agreed with that mission, and were [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3531.54s)]
*  abandoning them. And they never said anything about Israel. And nothing, no views on Gaza [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3537.22s)]
*  whatsoever. So again, if the principle is you can just be thrown out without due process, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3541.86s)]
*  then that's the principle that we have to think about and litigate. And no, I don't agree with [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3547.06s)]
*  you, Cenk. It's not just about Israel. Although again, criticizing Israel should not be grounds. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3551.6200000000003s)]
*  And material support, that's the standard. Not just support, material support. That's something [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3556.26s)]
*  that will have to be litigated. And I'm sure that a lot of people will, including the targets here, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3560.58s)]
*  will say, no, passing out a pamphlet is not material support. And one last thing, Piers, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3568.02s)]
*  you said this on the show and you said this again today. If he had said something in the past [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3573.86s)]
*  that was the thing that he said in the present, then he wouldn't have got his green card. Well, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3577.94s)]
*  you can't, the time space continuum doesn't work that way because the circumstances two years ago [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3581.94s)]
*  were not the circumstances today. So we can't project a 2024 situation on 20, whenever it was, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3587.94s)]
*  it might've been five years ago that he had that interview because there was no Gaza war. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3594.9s)]
*  There was a different policy. Things have changed. People change. The circumstances change. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3599.38s)]
*  So we can't say that he lied on his green card application by not uttering the things that he [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3603.78s)]
*  thought five years later because that's a logical fallacy. So let's just put that to the side and [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3609.14s)]
*  say that he deserves a right to his own defense. Full stop. Yeah. Look, I think we've got to end [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3614.34s)]
*  it there. But I would say on that point that I think he got it in 2022, which would have been [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3621.86s)]
*  just before October the seventh. That doesn't mean he didn't have pro-Hamas views before that. I don't [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3627.06s)]
*  know the answer to that question, but I do think regardless of that, if you're on a green card [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3631.7000000000003s)]
*  and you later support a terror group, then I'm afraid America has every right to throw you out. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3636.6600000000003s)]
*  That is my view. I may be wrong, Cheikh. Sometimes I am. I don't like to admit it, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOWAewTXiEI&t=3643.7000000000003s)]
