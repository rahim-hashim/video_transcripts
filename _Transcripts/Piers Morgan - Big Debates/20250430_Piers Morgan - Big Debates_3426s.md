# ‘DESPICABLE!’ Panel CONFRONTS Trump Impeachment Congressman | With Tim Pool
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg)
*  He got elected because people thought he was best in handling the economy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=0.0s)]
*  It turned out that he made a mess of it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=4.48s)]
*  Prices have gone up and he tried to bully China. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Instead of actually dealing with these issues, what do we get? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=10.48s)]
*  Bloviating nonsense. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=12.92s)]
*  It's 100 days in, we're going to impeach him. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=14.52s)]
*  But a lot of this is hyper-partisan sophistry intended to rile people up. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  First of all, where did this guy come from? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=22.96s)]
*  With all due respect, this is an idiotic thing to do. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  This is a political move to try to put him in good graces with the AOC crowd [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=28.56s)]
*  and the very, very far-left radical crowd. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=32.8s)]
*  I'm embarrassed for that congressman that he's doing that, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=36.08s)]
*  that he's fallen to that level. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=38.4s)]
*  This congressman seems to think that having bad polling numbers [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=39.88s)]
*  is an impeachable offence. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  It is utterly laughable and it's because the Democrats have no agenda. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  People often say that days feel like hours when they're relaxing on the beach. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=51.68s)]
*  But they also say it when they're highly stressed [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=55.72s)]
*  or having dental surgery. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=57.76s)]
*  We could probably all agree that President Trump's first 100 days [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=59.48s)]
*  have felt more like 1,000. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=62.48s)]
*  But is America basking in the sun while dreaming of a bright future? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=64.28s)]
*  Or is it having a root canal surgery? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=68.28s)]
*  Our esteemed panellists will grade the president on the economy, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=70.96s)]
*  war, culture and immigration. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=73.84s)]
*  Everyone has to give him some praise and everyone has to criticise him too. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=76.56s)]
*  Them's the rules today. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  I'm joined by founder and CEO of The Young Turks, Cenk Yüge, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=82.52s)]
*  author of Bad News In Second Class, Batiya Ungar Sargon, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=86.0s)]
*  the CEO of Timcast Media, Tim Poole [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=89.28s)]
*  and Senior Presidential Advisor for the US Agency for Global Media, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=91.8s)]
*  Carrie Lake. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=95.8s)]
*  Well, a star-study panel on a starry day. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=96.8s)]
*  Cenk will be beamed into us imminently, I'm informed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=100.64s)]
*  So we'll leave him as his large black square at the moment, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=103.88s)]
*  which has a kind of ominous feel to it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=106.6s)]
*  Let me start with you, Tim Poole, because you're not a full-on Trumper, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=109.52s)]
*  but you're not a full-on Trump basher. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=113.28s)]
*  You see some good, you see some bad. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=115.84s)]
*  When you look at the 100 days in totality, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=118.56s)]
*  what are you giving Trump on the scoreboard? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=122.28s)]
*  Regular grade, I guess, a B+. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  You know, what I would say is the Doge firings, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=128.2s)]
*  the getting rid of waste, fraud and abuse have been beyond my expectations. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=131.24s)]
*  I'm absolutely happy with that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=135.12s)]
*  Selective tariffs, I'm a huge fan and have been a huge fan for a while. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=137.76s)]
*  I do think universal tariffs, I'm very sceptical on, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=141.68s)]
*  but I did vote for the man and I do believe that he's... [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  It's been substantially better than what we've seen with Biden by miles. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=148.28s)]
*  Deportation, I think, is going fairly well. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  I think a lot of the concerns and criticisms are overhyped, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=156.2s)]
*  but we'll see. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=159.04s)]
*  I think overall pretty good. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=161.2s)]
*  I mean, would you have said the same thing if Joe Biden [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=163.64s)]
*  had had this first 100 days, which by any kind of yardstick, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  have been pretty chaotic, a lot of changing spinning plates [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=171.64s)]
*  and a tariff war that so far has caused a lot of short-term damage [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  to the US economy? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=181.64s)]
*  In all honesty, would you have said the same analysis if it was Biden? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=187.64s)]
*  I do think it's fair to point out that we're all going to be biased [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=188.72s)]
*  in some regard or another and Donald Trump's administration, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=191.72s)]
*  his worldview and his policies more align with me morally, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=194.84s)]
*  and I think that's a big issue for most people. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=199.4s)]
*  That being said, when Joe Biden came out and he was fighting against [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=201.28s)]
*  overdraft fees, I praised it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=205.0s)]
*  If Joe Biden had come out and said, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=207.4s)]
*  we're going to put tariffs in these certain areas... [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=209.36s)]
*  In fact, I never criticised him on any of the tariffs he did. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=210.96s)]
*  I think the issue is largely criticised where criticism is due [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=214.16s)]
*  and praised where praise is due. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump has certainly made some errors. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  He has this gaffe going around from ABC where he appears to genuinely believe [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  that Bregman Garcia actually had MS-13 written on his hand, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=226.4s)]
*  which is incorrect. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  But, you know, if he's going to make mistakes, we accept those. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=230.64s)]
*  If he's going to advance policies that are in line with the majority [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=233.96s)]
*  of Americans' moral views or at least what I support, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=238.2s)]
*  then I'm going to be substantially more forgiving on his errors [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=241.76s)]
*  than I would be for someone like Joe Biden, who represented open borders, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=244.88s)]
*  trans surgeries for children and other policies, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=249.32s)]
*  which I found to be destructive. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=252.6s)]
*  All right, Carrie Lake, you're very pro-Trump, we know that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  I like Donald Trump personally. I speak to him quite regularly. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=259.04s)]
*  I've got to say, though, this is a massive throw of a dice. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=262.0s)]
*  He's come back into the White House, he's thrown everything, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=265.68s)]
*  including the kitchen sink, up in the air. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  He has turned all establishment norms on their head. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  And right now, he's got very poor approval ratings [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=275.64s)]
*  and a really in-shock US economy that doesn't quite know what it's going to do [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=280.92s)]
*  or how this all plays out. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  It's a roll of a dice, isn't it? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=288.24s)]
*  Because at some stage, this has to work. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=289.68s)]
*  If it doesn't work, then come the midterms, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=292.48s)]
*  the Republicans are going to be in big trouble. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=296.16s)]
*  Well, let me start by saying I'm pro-America, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=299.08s)]
*  and this is why I love President Trump and I love his agenda, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=301.44s)]
*  because he has put our country first. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  I disagree with you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=306.64s)]
*  I think you're talking about some really bogus polling. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=307.96s)]
*  We know... I know how polling works. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=311.04s)]
*  I ran for office twice. Trust me, I know how polling works. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=312.68s)]
*  You can make a poll say anything. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=316.20000000000005s)]
*  And it's typical for the mainstream media to try to downplay [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  all of the accomplishments of President Trump and his incredible administration. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=323.12s)]
*  He has had no choice but to go in like a bull in a china shop and move quickly. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  We were on the verge, Pierce, of losing our country [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=332.44000000000005s)]
*  after four abysmal years of Joe Biden. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  The inflation was out of control. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  The border was wide open. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=340.04s)]
*  People were pouring in, including gang bangers like this guy [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=341.48s)]
*  that the fake news media is acting like is the second coming, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=345.28s)]
*  this Kilmore guy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=348.76s)]
*  And they're going to bat for him. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=350.35999999999996s)]
*  They don't give a damn about the American people. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=353.11999999999995s)]
*  And so President Trump has had to act and move quickly. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=355.64s)]
*  I'm glad he has, and he has overwhelming support. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  Even Tim talked about what he did with and what he is continuing to do with Doge [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=361.0s)]
*  coming in and cleaning out these agencies, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=365.67999999999995s)]
*  pulling back, slimming down the bureaucracy. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=367.52s)]
*  It has to be done or we will lose our country. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  We're not out of the woods just yet. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=373.32s)]

*  President Trump simply needed 100 days to get things turned around. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=387.35999999999996s)]

*  Frankly, I wish we could have him for the next, you know, 10,000 days [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=393.44s)]
*  because we need a fighter like President Trump for the long road. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=398.2s)]
*  Give me one criticism of the 100 days so far. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=402.04s)]
*  Boy, I really don't see any criticism. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=408.04s)]
*  And I'm not saying that because I know him and I like him. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=411.32s)]
*  I'm saying that because he's done a great job. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=414.0s)]
*  I mean, he's a human being. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=416.6s)]
*  Every once in a while, you might make a tiny misstep. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=417.88s)]
*  You know, I can't off the top of my head. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=420.92s)]
*  Pretend he's Joe Biden for a minute and try to answer that question again. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=423.0s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=426.08000000000004s)]
*  Honestly, if he if he was doing the things Joe Biden did, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=427.8s)]
*  if President Trump let inflation go through the roof, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=431.44s)]
*  if President Trump opened up the borders and allowed children to be trafficked, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  fentanyl to be trafficked in, if President Trump was trying to start up wars [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=438.84s)]
*  rather than bring about peace, I would be very critical of him. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=443.84s)]
*  Trust me, I I'm very realistic. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=447.0s)]
*  And if he were doing things that were dumb and stupid, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=450.0s)]
*  I would be all over it calling it dumb and stupid. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=452.44s)]
*  He's doing things that are strong, that are brilliant and that I believe will help [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=454.91999999999996s)]

*  All right, well, check you get welcome to uncensored. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=462.44s)]
*  You're you're laughing, I suspect, not in a way that indicates [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=464.68s)]
*  fulsome support for what Miss Lakewood is saying. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=468.4s)]
*  No, no, not fulsome support at all. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=473.6s)]
*  All right. So first, usually, you know, obviously, we're always fair. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=476.64s)]
*  Right. So in the beginning, he comes out and he closed the border. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=480.72s)]
*  And that's really popular. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=484.52s)]
*  That's what people elected him for. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=485.96s)]
*  He does a lot of executive orders. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=487.6s)]
*  Now, a lot of those in the beginning, very beginning, I disagreed with instantly. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=489.16s)]
*  But it it did some of the later ones were more disastrous. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=493.36s)]
*  But it looked like there was action being taken. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=497.6s)]
*  So and it showed in his polls, he'd already won the popular vote. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=499.72s)]
*  And then he added to that lead in his polling. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=503.68s)]
*  And that's back when, of course, Republicans believed in polling when he was above [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=506.44s)]
*  50 percent in popular, et cetera. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=509.8s)]
*  And then what did he do? He pulled a Trump. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=511.92s)]
*  He can't help himself. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=514.4s)]
*  He loves his authoritarian tendencies, to put it mildly. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=515.48s)]
*  He loves testing the limits of what he could do. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=519.72s)]
*  He started talking about third terms, started saying, we're not doing due process. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=522.24s)]
*  We're not listening to the courts, et cetera. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=526.24s)]
*  And now he's lost people on all sides, the wild, outrageous tariffs. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  And, you know, obviously, Batia and Kerry and I had a debate about that. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=533.64s)]
*  And I was right and they were wrong. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  And so I'm curious to see if they'll admit that now, because I said, of course, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=539.04s)]
*  Trump will pull back the global tariffs. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=544.0s)]
*  They were nuclear and ridiculous. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=546.24s)]
*  And he pulled them back. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=548.32s)]
*  I got two days after we had that debate. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=549.64s)]
*  So now he's made a giant mess of it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=552.64s)]
*  I mean, everyone from Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, Patrick Bitt, David, Dave [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=555.48s)]
*  Portnoy, Joe Rogan and the yesterday Alex Jones all saying, what's going on here? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=560.36s)]
*  We even they didn't sign up for violating the Constitution and due process and all [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=566.32s)]
*  of that, let alone the trillions of dollars he's bled out of the market by having no [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=570.68s)]
*  idea how to handle things economically. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=576.16s)]
*  So he started out strong in the beginning for a couple of days. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=578.68s)]
*  And then the rest has now just been a total debacle and disaster. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=582.04s)]
*  And here's I'm always amused by both sides. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=585.88s)]
*  And you've seen me call out both sides live as it's happening, when the Democrats [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=588.1999999999999s)]
*  were like, oh, Joe Biden's polling is in the 30s, but I bet it bounces back to the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=593.64s)]
*  60s or polling doesn't matter. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=598.2s)]
*  Whenever they're down, always polling doesn't matter or polling is fake. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=600.32s)]
*  And now when Trump is in the 39, 40 percent range, all of a sudden here's Carrie [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=603.6s)]
*  Lake telling us that polling doesn't matter or it isn't real. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=608.2s)]
*  It's real. It's not perfect, but it's real. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=611.32s)]
*  Trump is badly, badly hurt. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=614.08s)]
*  I mean, she's one last fact. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=615.88s)]
*  Fifty two percent in a recent poll said of Americans said that he was a quote, a [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=617.5600000000001s)]
*  dangerous dictator looking to take away American democracy, including 56 percent of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=622.72s)]
*  independence and a shockingly high 17 percent of Republicans think he's a [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=627.88s)]
*  dangerous dictator. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=633.16s)]
*  You really can't handle it any worse than that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=634.6s)]
*  Now, maybe about to shock you with this, but tallow is an exceptional moisturizer. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=638.52s)]
*  The oil in our skin shares many of the same fatty acids as tallow, making it nearly [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=643.72s)]
*  impossible to beat. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=648.0s)]
*  You can have silky soft skin like me with an all natural alternative. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=649.48s)]
*  There's no fillers and it's much more than just a moisturizer. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=654.28s)]
*  It can replace lotion, night cream, wrinkle cream, neosporin and much more. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=657.7600000000001s)]
*  It's powerful enough to heal your skin, but it's safe enough to spread on your [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=663.72s)]

*  Van Mans Mint Bone Tooth Powder is packed with all the minerals and the nutrients [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=672.96s)]

*  I mean, Batier, you know, the stats tell a story. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=708.36s)]
*  They're not always completely infallible, but they tell a story. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=711.08s)]
*  You know, his approval rating, Trump, peaked at 52 percent, which was an [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=714.4000000000001s)]
*  incredible figure, given that it was down at 34 percent when he left office in 2021. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=718.84s)]
*  But now it's slid back to 44 percent, which is an extremely rapid fall. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=724.1600000000001s)]
*  And it's linked almost entirely to what's going on with the economy. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  Are you entirely confident that his strategy here is, A, one, that he planned [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=734.32s)]
*  exactly how it's rolled out and B, that it's working how he intended it? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=740.28s)]
*  I don't really know about his intentions, unlike you, Pierce. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=748.04s)]
*  I don't talk to him regularly. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=750.36s)]
*  But I can tell you that I think it's going very, very well. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=752.2s)]
*  I know the polling is bad. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=755.04s)]
*  He started out with a large portion of the country who really, really dislikes him. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=756.32s)]
*  He managed to convince a lot of independents and a lot of Democrats [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=760.4399999999999s)]
*  to give him a shot and to vote for him. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=763.2s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that he convinced people to like him. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=765.08s)]
*  He's a very polarizing person, just his personality. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=767.72s)]
*  But I think when you look at the agenda, he is he has tailor made this agenda [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=770.84s)]
*  for the new base of the GOP, which is the working class. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=776.28s)]
*  And when you talk to working class Americans, which I do all the time [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=780.24s)]
*  and I hear from hundreds, if not thousands of them on a regular basis, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=783.52s)]
*  they love this. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=787.72s)]
*  They feel like this is exactly what they voted for. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=788.84s)]
*  The situation with China was unsustainable. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=792.96s)]
*  It made the elites in this country very, very wealthy, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=796.28s)]
*  which is why elites on the left and on the right are furious at him [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=799.24s)]
*  and why Wall Street is furious at him. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=803.16s)]
*  But working class people see this as him turning the boat around [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=805.48s)]
*  and once again, prioritizing American prosperity rather than what we've had, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=810.04s)]
*  which is the pillaging of the middle class by the elites. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=815.4399999999999s)]
*  And I think, you know, you asked Tim Pool a really good question. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=819.6s)]
*  Well, would you have cheered Joe Biden if he had done the same things [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=822.3199999999999s)]
*  that you liked here? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=825.32s)]
*  Pierce, it is unimaginable that a Democrat would do [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=826.5600000000001s)]
*  what President Trump just did, because Wall Street now is very much [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=830.44s)]
*  a funder of the Democrats. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=835.6800000000001s)]
*  And if you look at President Obama, you look at his first action in office. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=838.0400000000001s)]
*  It was given a 700 billion dollar bailout to Wall Street [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=843.32s)]
*  while 10 million Americans lost their homes. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=848.2s)]
*  And that included 30 billion dollars of bonuses to the crooks [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=850.8s)]

*  He chose Wall Street over Main Street because the Democrats [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=857.7199999999999s)]
*  had become the party of the rich. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=860.4799999999999s)]
*  And what we just saw is an American president [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=862.1999999999999s)]
*  choosing Main Street over Wall Street. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=864.7199999999999s)]
*  And that is what people are going to remember at the end of the day [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=867.64s)]
*  from these hundred days. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  OK, well, let's... [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=872.0799999999999s)]
*  Trump has used the opening moments of his hundred days rally to condemn [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=873.92s)]
*  a lunatic dumb guy for demanding his impeachment. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=876.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, Democratic Congressman Sri Tannadhar introduced formal articles [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=880.44s)]
*  of impeachment earlier this week, citing acts of tyranny and abuse of power. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=884.32s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=888.6400000000001s)]
*  Welcome to you, Congressman. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=890.4000000000001s)]
*  So you're going hard on Trump. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=892.44s)]
*  You're citing sweeping abuse of power, flagrant violations of the Constitution, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=894.8800000000001s)]
*  acts of tyranny that undermine American democracy and threaten the rule of law. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=899.24s)]
*  Out of interest, what has Trump done that has massively surprised you [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=905.0s)]
*  or that most of his diehard supporters didn't vote for? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=909.08s)]
*  But look, the tariffs, this is Congress' prerogative. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=914.2s)]
*  He took that over illegally, unconstitutionally and made a mess of it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=918.9200000000001s)]
*  And that lost stock values, people's 401k value got lost. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=924.8000000000001s)]
*  He made a mess of it and he tried to bully China. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=930.6800000000001s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=933.76s)]
*  And right now, prices are for everything. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=935.2s)]
*  Are going up. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=938.84s)]
*  You know, he got elected because people thought he was best in handling the economy. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=939.8000000000001s)]
*  It turned out that he made a mess of it. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=944.44s)]
*  Prices have gone up. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=947.4s)]
*  Now he's trying to tell Amazon, don't tell people that a tariff [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  addition to the prices. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=954.28s)]
*  You know, he has trampled [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=956.96s)]
*  freedom of first right, you know, freedom. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=960.88s)]
*  He Supreme Court, Supreme Court, nine. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=963.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, decision to bring Garcia back because he did not get the due process. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=966.04s)]
*  Trump said he ignored that ruling. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=972.1999999999999s)]
*  He just said yesterday that he's able to bring him back, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=975.16s)]
*  but he will not bring him back. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=978.3199999999999s)]
*  So he's defying Supreme Court. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=980.04s)]
*  And that was the last straw for me. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=982.5999999999999s)]
*  And that's why I introduced the articles of impeachment to impeach. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=985.24s)]
*  This president must go. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=989.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, he is on his done unconstitutional act, illegal act. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=991.28s)]
*  And this cannot stand. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=995.92s)]
*  I mean, again, I'd simply say, what do you think that he's doing that he [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=998.9599999999999s)]
*  that his supporters didn't expect him to do? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1002.64s)]
*  He said, I'm going to sort the southern border out, which he indisputably has done. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1005.12s)]
*  I'm going to get very, very tough on deportations of illegal immigrants. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1009.76s)]
*  And all right, there are one or two cases which have got the headlines, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1014.0799999999999s)]
*  which are certainly, in my estimation, worth examining on the due process question. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1017.4s)]
*  But the majority of people have been deported. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1022.12s)]
*  There seems to be no question mark over his challenging court power [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1024.44s)]
*  in a number of areas, but has said ultimately he will abide by the will of the courts. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1029.6000000000001s)]
*  None of this strikes me particularly at the moment, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1036.3200000000002s)]
*  the behavior of a dictator who's just decided none of these rules count for me. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1039.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, look at all the polls. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1045.64s)]
*  You know, there are several polls that came out last week, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1047.0s)]
*  and he's underwater in almost every category, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1049.92s)]
*  including economy, that is supposed to be his best category. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1053.28s)]
*  And his own supporters are now, you know, having bias remorse [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1057.3999999999999s)]
*  that they made a mistake, that he hasn't worked on the economy, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1062.6799999999998s)]
*  that, like he said, he's going to do instead. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1066.9199999999998s)]
*  He's talking about Greenland and making Canada 51st state [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1070.04s)]
*  and then military action again, Mexico. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1075.08s)]
*  None of this his supporters expected him to do. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1078.1999999999998s)]
*  They expected him to fix the economy, because that's what they thought. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1082.24s)]
*  And he said that's what he's going to do. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1086.72s)]
*  Out of interest. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1088.88s)]
*  And look, I mean, this tariff was still in a very early stage. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1089.92s)]
*  You say that he hasn't succeeded in bullying China, as you put it. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1094.24s)]
*  But how do you know it won't succeed over time? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1098.76s)]
*  Trump is right. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1101.48s)]
*  Well, Trump has launched a radical tariff war. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1102.96s)]
*  No other word for it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1105.88s)]
*  What happens if in, say, six months time, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1107.32s)]
*  it turns out that most of the countries that United States has trade deals [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1110.1200000000001s)]
*  with have renegotiated in America's favour and including China. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1114.8000000000002s)]
*  Now, in that eventuality, if the economy is doing well again, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1119.8000000000002s)]
*  would you admit then that you were a little too hasty? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1124.2s)]
*  In other words, should this be allowed to be given time to see if it works? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1127.0800000000002s)]
*  Look, we have seen the flip flops. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1132.2800000000002s)]
*  One day the tariffs are on. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1134.4s)]
*  The very next day, he takes them off. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1136.5600000000002s)]
*  He first acts tough on China, then he says he's going to be nice to China. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1139.44s)]
*  You know, it's about how he wakes up in the morning and whatever, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1144.8s)]
*  you know, he thinks about. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1148.48s)]
*  There is no plan. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1150.04s)]
*  There is no, you know, no [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1151.0s)]
*  plan or strategy here. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1154.92s)]
*  It's just Trump, whatever he thinks he is. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1157.6000000000001s)]
*  He has got a defense secretary who can't keep any secrets, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1159.92s)]
*  sharing the sensitive information on signal chat. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1164.48s)]
*  This is, you know, that he has got a health and human services secretary [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1168.36s)]
*  that is making, you know, horrible medical decisions. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1172.56s)]

*  And he's just you agree. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1181.52s)]
*  Do you agree that he has stemmed the issue at the southern border by 95 percent, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1184.04s)]
*  that the number of people coming in illegally on that border has reduced by 95 percent? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1191.16s)]
*  Do you accept that? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1196.28s)]
*  And do you think that's been a good thing, a successful story? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1197.32s)]
*  If you're always on the move, as I am, you probably find it difficult [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1201.8s)]

*  While some accomplishments have been done at the border, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1281.08s)]

*  Well, he's not planned. He's gone ahead with it. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1294.56s)]

*  deserved an additional hearing, a third or fourth hearing, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1310.8s)]

*  to El Salvador, his home country, and have that conversation. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1325.76s)]
*  But instead of actually dealing with these issues, what do we get? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1328.8s)]
*  Bloviating nonsense. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1331.36s)]
*  It's it's it's 100 days in. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1333.0s)]
*  We're going to impeach him for what? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1334.56s)]
*  Oh, he's doing all of these things wrong or whatever. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1336.28s)]
*  Look, the American people voted for this. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1338.36s)]
*  They're largely happy with what they want. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1340.16s)]
*  People have concerns about the economy. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1341.96s)]
*  His polls are down. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1343.8400000000001s)]
*  That's true. That's fine. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1345.3200000000002s)]
*  But a lot of this is hyper partisan sophistry intended to rile people up. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1347.0400000000002s)]
*  There's two there's two reasons why I'll tell you Trump's polls are down. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1352.8400000000001s)]
*  And they are down. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1355.76s)]
*  If you track Rasmussen, he dropped by about six or seven points [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1356.8400000000001s)]
*  from where he was earlier. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1360.4s)]
*  It's a swing, not a drop. He's down by four. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1361.3600000000001s)]
*  And this is probably due to tariffs. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1363.92s)]
*  When you look at the corporate press, the principal institutions, ABC, etc. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1365.76s)]
*  He's down in the double digits. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1369.68s)]
*  However, if you go back to the start of his of his second term, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1371.2s)]
*  you can see that the polls completely disagree with each other in ridiculous ways. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1375.16s)]
*  One day he's up 10. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1379.56s)]
*  The next day, a new polling agency says down 10. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1380.68s)]
*  The only thing you really need to track is a singular polls movement over time. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1383.4s)]
*  And we are seeing a minor decline. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1386.6399999999999s)]
*  That is likely due to 401 case dropping. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1389.04s)]
*  People being concerned about this. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1391.2s)]
*  Does this rise to the level of impeachment? No. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1392.72s)]
*  I think you're doing this largely because you want to get your name out there [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1395.16s)]
*  because the Democrats have no front runner. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1398.0s)]
*  No one knows who's in charge of the party. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1399.92s)]
*  So everyone's clawing to the top of the crabs in a barrel to try and be the [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1401.44s)]
*  pick me for 2028. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1404.5200000000002s)]
*  All right, Congresswoman, you're just doing this because you're a narcissist, basically. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1406.5200000000002s)]
*  But look, in the first 100 days, his numbers are lower [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1411.7600000000002s)]
*  than any other president. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1417.0400000000002s)]
*  You had to go back 70 years. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1418.88s)]
*  And the only other bad president, bad numbers for a president in the first [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1421.0400000000002s)]
*  100 days was Trump 45. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1425.72s)]
*  So people have spoken. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1428.32s)]
*  People are having a bias remorse. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1432.56s)]
*  People are even I've spoken to many of Trump supporters and [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1434.8s)]
*  they are usually disappointed by his actions, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1439.64s)]
*  by his failure to fix the economy. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1444.32s)]
*  That's number one on people's minds. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1447.16s)]
*  OK, Carrie, Carrie, what's your response to the congressman? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1449.6s)]
*  Because there are lots of people saying this. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1452.8s)]
*  And the Democrats have got their gander up a bit now. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1454.56s)]
*  They're beginning to marshal their so-called resistance in a better way, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1457.8s)]
*  because Trump's giving them a lot of opportunity to do that. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  At what point politically do you start feeling twitchy [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1465.56s)]
*  if the tariff war doesn't work, how Trump intends it to? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1469.1999999999998s)]
*  First of all, where did this guy come from? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1474.12s)]
*  With all due respect, this is an idiotic thing to do. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1476.7199999999998s)]
*  And the Democrats proving that the Democrat Party has no play. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1479.9199999999998s)]
*  They don't know what to do right now because Trump is winning on everything. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1483.8s)]
*  He's strategizing how to fix the economy that Joe Biden drove [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1487.76s)]
*  not only into a ditch, but off a cliff. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1491.24s)]
*  And this is why the American people were suffering. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1493.88s)]
*  And it sounds to me like this is a political move to try to put him in good [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1496.3600000000001s)]
*  graces with the AOC crowd and the very, very far left radical crowd [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1500.16s)]
*  ahead of another election. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1505.6s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1507.56s)]
*  The American people were sick of the previous attempts of [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1508.56s)]
*  impeaching President Trump before. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1512.0s)]
*  They don't want to see this again. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1514.56s)]
*  And I'm embarrassed for this gentleman. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1516.52s)]
*  I'm embarrassed for that congressman that he is doing that, that he's fallen [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1519.0s)]
*  to that level to try to impeach President Trump in his first 100 days [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1521.96s)]
*  as he tries to save us from the serious missteps of Joe Biden [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1526.24s)]
*  and that administration that almost broke the backs of every American in this country. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1530.96s)]
*  What about the fentanyl that's no longer pouring across the border? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1536.6399999999999s)]
*  What about the lives that are saved there? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1540.88s)]
*  What about a president who's trying to end a war that's killing [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1542.64s)]
*  thousands, tens of thousands of people and costing all kinds of our treasure [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1547.0400000000002s)]
*  over in Ukraine? What about that? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1551.72s)]
*  No, he's trying to concentrate on something to to make people all of a sudden [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1554.2800000000002s)]

*  I find it despicable. I really do. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1561.88s)]
*  Congressman, you're despicable. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1564.24s)]
*  That's just what the action is. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1566.5200000000002s)]
*  Despicable. I don't I don't know this congressman. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1568.2800000000002s)]
*  I find his actions despicable and political. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1571.16s)]
*  Rather than going to work every day and fighting for the American people [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1574.0400000000002s)]
*  in his district, he's trying to thwart President Trump [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1577.88s)]
*  as President Trump works very hard to try to save this country [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1581.48s)]
*  and get us on the right track. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1585.0s)]
*  OK, Congressman, you're doing despicable things. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1586.2s)]
*  Well, look, look, he has failed on economy in a world. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1589.0800000000002s)]
*  Our relationship with our allies, you know, he's not failed on the economy. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1593.5600000000002s)]
*  Unimpeachable. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1597.64s)]
*  You know, look, he said on day I understand. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1598.2s)]
*  But on day one, he said he's going to fix you. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1600.96s)]
*  Korean War. He hasn't done that in 100 days. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1603.0s)]
*  You know, nothing that he said he's going to do has he has done. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1606.48s)]
*  And, you know, people economy is in terrible shape. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1609.64s)]
*  His tariffs are totally [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1614.16s)]
*  unproductive. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1617.6000000000001s)]
*  And our industry, I represent Detroit, Michigan. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1619.32s)]

*  Look, look, this he hasn't thought this through. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1630.8s)]
*  When you put imposed tariffs, you got to be ready [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1634.16s)]
*  to have manufacturing happening in America. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1638.04s)]
*  You know, I agree that more manufacturing needs to happen in America, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1641.56s)]
*  but it doesn't happen just because he raises tariffs on foreign countries. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1645.24s)]
*  You need to invest in manufacturing. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1650.04s)]
*  This is a process that takes tens of years to get this done. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1652.56s)]

*  Joe Biden, who, as I said, destroyed the American economy [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1707.32s)]

*  Trump has done a brilliant job. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1720.56s)]

*  And, you know, and Joe Biden had destroyed the economy. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1724.84s)]
*  It was record low unemployment. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1727.48s)]
*  You're being preposterous. No one believes you. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1729.92s)]
*  Everyone realizes it was the tariffs. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1732.44s)]
*  They had a perfectly good economy handed to him. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1734.48s)]
*  And he at this point has shattered it to pieces. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1736.8799999999999s)]
*  So I'm getting sick of the propaganda. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1739.6s)]
*  I'm also getting sick of the, you know, with all due respect, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1741.16s)]
*  this is idiotic. That's not all due respect. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1744.6s)]
*  So I'm not sure you have good command of the language. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1747.0s)]
*  OK. All right. Then don't say all due respect. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1750.12s)]
*  Second of all, you're lecturing people about how to get elected. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1752.36s)]
*  Let's be honest. Let's be honest, Carrie. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1755.12s)]
*  You and I are not in a position to lecture people on how to get elected. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1757.4399999999998s)]
*  OK. You haven't won a lot of elections, neither have I. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1760.6399999999999s)]
*  OK, so let's at least I've helped in winning elections. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1763.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure you have. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1765.9599999999998s)]
*  So and the brother over here in Michigan has actually won an election. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1767.08s)]
*  But we're conflating two different things. OK. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1770.0s)]
*  Number one, we're talking about the polling. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1772.76s)]
*  Look, Trump's down and hurt. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1774.72s)]
*  It doesn't matter how much you guys spin it. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1776.28s)]
*  We're going to have that play out. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1779.0s)]
*  But that's not related to impeachment, whether he's popular or not, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1781.24s)]
*  has nothing to do with impeachment. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1784.44s)]
*  So I don't even know why the congressman brought that up, to be honest. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1786.28s)]
*  And I think that this impeachment thing is way too premature. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1789.2s)]
*  What are you going to get enough Republicans on board? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1792.52s)]
*  There's no way you are right. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1794.48s)]
*  On the other hand, are there actual good grounds for it? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1795.72s)]
*  There are. You're just not going to be able to execute it. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1798.24s)]
*  The grounds for impeachment are doing things that are illegal or unconstitutional. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1800.72s)]
*  Has he subverted the will of Congress many, many times? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1804.2s)]
*  They appropriated money. He refused to spend it. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1808.1599999999999s)]
*  Or he's spending money that they didn't appropriate. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1810.48s)]
*  Or he's taking powers like the power to tariff that Congress has [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1812.8799999999999s)]
*  or the power to declare war that Congress has. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1816.24s)]
*  I know the last one every president abuses. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1818.28s)]
*  But we have massive violations of the Constitution here. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1820.6s)]
*  The Supreme Court says, bring this guy back, I'll break your Garcia. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1823.48s)]
*  And not only that, there was a clear do not deport order. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1826.16s)]
*  And he violates that order and then admits that it was a mistake [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1830.64s)]
*  and he still won't bring him back. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1834.0800000000002s)]
*  The problem there isn't immigration. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1835.52s)]
*  It's due process, which is a cornerstone of Western civilization. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1837.4s)]
*  But, Cheng, do you... [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1841.16s)]
*  And Batia and Chen and others. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1842.16s)]
*  I made the point... [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1843.28s)]
*  We can go back and blame others. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1844.0s)]
*  OK, but look, I made... [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1845.6000000000001s)]
*  Michelle Obama piped up about this immigration stuff on X. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1846.72s)]
*  And I replied to her and my reply has had gazillions of retweets [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1851.3200000000002s)]
*  because all I said was, as far as I'm aware, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1855.52s)]
*  her own husband deported over three million people in eight years. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1859.04s)]
*  And no one can persuade me that all of those were done with perfect due process. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1864.32s)]
*  But I don't remember anything like the cacophony of outrage [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1869.8799999999999s)]
*  from the left when that was going down. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1873.52s)]
*  And the bumble... [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1875.96s)]
*  I've said this before many times, he was the deporter in chief, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1877.0s)]
*  was his nickname in Mexico. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1880.4s)]
*  He couldn't get people out of the country fast enough. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1882.08s)]
*  Why was it fine for Obama? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1884.4s)]
*  And why do liberals just try to pretend that never happened? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1886.72s)]
*  And why is it so evil when Trump throws out a lot of people [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1889.6s)]
*  that I would imagine most Americans totally agree with? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1893.8s)]
*  Yes, there are some. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1896.36s)]
*  Garcia may well be one or not. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1897.84s)]
*  We don't really know yet whether he was in this gang or not. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1899.8s)]
*  If he was, then he deserves to be in the El Salvador hellhole. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1902.56s)]
*  If he isn't and he's innocent, he deserves to come back. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1906.32s)]
*  But let's not pretend that most of the people that Trump is kicking out [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1909.36s)]
*  were not on the deportation list already and probably deserve to be thrown out. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1913.72s)]
*  Yeah. So, Pierce, the beautiful thing about me is that I'm consistent on all these things. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1919.92s)]
*  So when Obama did that, I criticised them. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1925.28s)]
*  And in fact, when Obama killed Anwar al-Ablaqi without due process, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1927.84s)]
*  I was all over him. That was outrageous. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1932.44s)]
*  It was arguably worse than anything Trump has done. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1935.04s)]
*  And that's where mainstream media loses all their credibility [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1938.52s)]
*  and democratic politicians lose their credibility [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1941.0s)]
*  when they're not even-handed. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1943.32s)]
*  So that was totally unacceptable. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1944.56s)]
*  But that doesn't make what Trump is doing acceptable. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1946.36s)]
*  And Trump, has he gone further than Obama in terms of turning people back to the border? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1950.48s)]
*  When you turn people back to the border, as Trump is doing now and Obama did, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1954.72s)]
*  that is not unconstitutional. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1958.0s)]
*  But has he gone further? Yes. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1959.6s)]
*  Did Obama ignore court orders? No. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1961.76s)]
*  Did he say we should send American citizens to a foreign country like El Salvador? No. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1964.6s)]
*  Did Obama say that he'd run for a third term, which is deeply unconstitutional? No. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1969.4399999999998s)]
*  Did Obama kidnap people off the streets of America for criticising Israel and arrest and deport them? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1973.3999999999999s)]
*  No. Hang on. Let me add some... [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1979.32s)]
*  By the way, hold on, let me finish the thought. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1981.6799999999998s)]
*  There's tons of right-wingers who agree with me. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1984.6799999999998s)]
*  Let me add some... [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1986.84s)]
*  Dr Carlson agrees, Candice Owens agrees, Joe Rogan agrees. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1987.52s)]
*  Hang on. Let me add some things to your list. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1990.6799999999998s)]
*  Did Obama campaign in 2008-09 on a ticket of closing Guantanamo Bay [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1993.32s)]
*  because it was an illegal torture chamber and he was a lawyer? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=1999.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2001.8799999999999s)]
*  Is it still open? Yes. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2002.48s)]
*  Did he deport more people pro rata than any president in history? Yes. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2004.72s)]
*  Did he drop more bombs in a calendar year outside of World War II [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2009.92s)]
*  than America's ever dropped in a year ever? Yes. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2014.28s)]
*  Did he run illegal drone programmes that killed innocent people at weddings? Yes. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2017.6s)]
*  In other words, there are lots of things on Obama's watch. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2022.6s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2025.84s)]
*  So my point is, you've got to look at these things in totality. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2026.8799999999999s)]
*  If I was in America, which I'm not, but I'm a proud visa holder [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2029.8s)]
*  and I have a home in America, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2034.6s)]
*  I look at the success of our southern border as absolutely stunning. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2036.16s)]
*  And yet the amount of coverage that's getting is almost nothing. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2040.36s)]
*  And it says to me that the media remains... [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2043.68s)]
*  But whose fault is that, Piers? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2045.6s)]
*  Well, it's the mainstream... To me, it's the mainstream media. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2046.72s)]
*  Well, let me bring in Batia here. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2049.84s)]
*  Batia, it just seems to me that the mainstream media... [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2051.4s)]
*  No, no, hold on, hold on. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2053.2s)]
*  You asked me a question. Let me answer it real quick, Piers. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2054.36s)]
*  So, look, in terms of the criticism of mainstream media that's hypocritical, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2057.2799999999997s)]
*  I just pointed it out. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2062.7999999999997s)]
*  But it's not mainstream media that did this. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2064.0s)]
*  To Trump, if he had just focused on closing the border, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2066.08s)]
*  right now might be at 55% approval rating or really high. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2068.4799999999996s)]
*  I mentioned that right in the beginning. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2071.8799999999997s)]
*  But instead, he bungled it because he's a serial bungler [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2073.3999999999996s)]
*  and he keeps testing the limits of his power [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2076.7599999999998s)]
*  because he's authoritarian by nature. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2078.7599999999998s)]
*  He didn't have to do those four, five unconstitutional things [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2080.68s)]
*  that I just listed. He did it on purpose. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2083.12s)]
*  He's the one punching himself in the face. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2085.64s)]
*  So don't blame media for that. That was all Trump. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2087.92s)]
*  All right, except that Batia, what I would say is... [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2090.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, right. That's the propaganda. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2093.2s)]
*  We'll come to you in a moment. Let Batia just respond to that first. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2095.08s)]
*  Well, all of these marginal cases, when you actually look into them, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2101.2s)]
*  turn out to be not so marginal. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2104.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, Kilmar Garcia did not have an order not to deport him. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2106.2799999999997s)]
*  He had an order not to deport him to El Salvador, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2111.04s)]
*  so they sent him to the wrong country. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2113.36s)]
*  But this person is a wife-beater and a gangbanger and a human trafficker. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2115.52s)]
*  He should have been deported to another country. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2119.7599999999998s)]
*  We were let down as Americans because he got a lot of due process [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2122.64s)]
*  and they just didn't follow through [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2127.28s)]
*  because the immigration courts are deeply flawed. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2129.44s)]
*  You look at these people who were picked up for supposedly criticizing Israel, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2132.12s)]
*  they both, the two that are in the news a lot, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2135.8s)]
*  belong to a group called Columbia University Apartheid Divest, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2138.92s)]
*  which put out literature 100% supporting Hamas and the October 7th attack. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2142.4s)]
*  That is a violation of a green card. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2148.52s)]
*  We would never have given somebody a visa [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2150.76s)]
*  who said, I'm going to belong to a group [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2153.0s)]
*  that's going to put out literature in support of Hamas. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2155.08s)]
*  The two children who allegedly are American citizens who were deported, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2158.52s)]
*  they were not deported. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2162.0s)]
*  Their mothers were deported, and because their mothers are not sociopaths, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2163.2000000000003s)]
*  they chose to take their children with them [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2167.36s)]
*  rather than calling up and finding someone else to take their two-year-old children. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2169.7999999999997s)]
*  So all of these supposedly liminal cases are actually nothing of the sort. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2174.56s)]
*  There has been no constitutional crisis. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2179.68s)]
*  This congressman seems to think that having bad polling numbers [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2181.3599999999997s)]
*  is an impeachable offense, is somehow a high crime and misdemeanor. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2184.9599999999996s)]
*  It is utterly laughable, and it's because the Democrats have no agenda. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2189.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is running to the left of them on economics [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2194.3599999999997s)]
*  and to the left of them on fighting wars and being anti-war [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2198.32s)]
*  and trying to get us out of different things and trying to settle wars. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2201.6400000000003s)]
*  And he is a social moderate. He's not even a conservative. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2205.2400000000002s)]
*  There is not a single value that the Democrats hold [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2208.4s)]
*  that they are not willing to immediately abandon if Donald Trump starts to defend it. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2212.0400000000004s)]
*  It was the Democrats who thought that we had to control the border [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2216.48s)]
*  to protect working-class wages. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2219.84s)]
*  And now all you see is Democrats out there demanding free trade [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2221.5600000000004s)]
*  and demanding more access to China. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2226.0s)]
*  You see Democrats literally sharing Chinese propaganda [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2227.88s)]
*  because it's against Trump. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2232.04s)]
*  They have chosen China over their own working-class voters. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2233.8s)]
*  And, congressman, I'm sorry, but the UAW and the Teamsters [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2236.84s)]
*  have both endorsed the tariffs. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2240.44s)]
*  You're in a lot of trouble in Michigan. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2242.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, look, factories, auto factories are being closed. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2245.1600000000003s)]
*  Auto workers are losing jobs. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2248.6s)]
*  Look, the unconstitutional things this president tried to... [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2251.48s)]
*  The pump-and-dump scheme, remember the means that he profited from? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2256.84s)]
*  Personally profited from. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2262.4s)]
*  Remember that the freedom of speech, the lawyers who had fought against him, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2264.96s)]
*  he intimidated those and then... [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2270.76s)]
*  OK, but, congressman, what about the sustained lawfare [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2273.5600000000004s)]
*  that was waged against Trump by the left? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2278.1600000000003s)]
*  And, by the way, one of the most self-harming acts of lawfare [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2281.0s)]
*  ever waged because all it did was make Trump more popular [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2287.32s)]
*  and ended up getting him re-elected. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2289.64s)]
*  So it was cretinously stupid to do it. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2291.4s)]
*  But there could be no doubt that the left conspired collectively [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2293.7999999999997s)]
*  to try and take Trump down, put him in prison. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2298.08s)]
*  You had people shooting him, literally, trying to kill him. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2301.08s)]
*  And all of this led to Trump being in the White House. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2303.84s)]
*  The Democrats have got their own backyard to clean up first [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2306.72s)]
*  before they start issuing any kind of, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2310.0s)]
*  well, you know, isn't this all terrible? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2312.36s)]
*  When the way you treated Trump, many would argue, was despicable. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2314.44s)]
*  Let me bring in Tim. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2317.7200000000003s)]
*  I have a favour to ask of this congressman. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2319.6s)]
*  And, excuse me, I hope Cenk joins me in this. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2321.48s)]
*  Congressman, will you file articles of impeachment against Barack Obama [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2324.2400000000002s)]
*  for the extrajudicial assassination of Abdulrahman al-Awlalaki? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2328.36s)]
*  I was not a member of congress then. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2332.56s)]
*  You don't have to be convicted now. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2334.92s)]
*  And we can convict him and put him in prison. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2336.52s)]
*  If you want to file this. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2338.4s)]
*  I have seen the unconstitutional illegal activities of Donald Trump. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2340.12s)]
*  And those are the ones that I am holding him responsible for. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2345.12s)]
*  Nobody cared when Obama murdered American citizens. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2349.2s)]
*  Especially a 16-year-old kid who is not a target, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2352.7999999999997s)]
*  who has families... [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2355.7599999999998s)]
*  Obama is not the president right now. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2357.04s)]
*  Is Donald Trump the president? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2358.56s)]
*  Is the people are hurting... [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2359.68s)]
*  He is the one who is grabbing power. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2361.3199999999997s)]
*  He is the one who is taking power away from congress. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2364.16s)]
*  And the funds that congress has appropriated, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2367.8s)]
*  he is not releasing those funds. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2371.2000000000003s)]
*  He is putting a hold on that. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2373.1200000000003s)]
*  He is the one that illegally could doge [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2374.6000000000004s)]
*  and an unelected, unconfirmed Elon Musk in charge of it. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2378.2000000000003s)]
*  He is the one who threw out that reporter from AP, from White House, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2383.2000000000003s)]
*  trampling on freedom of speech of the press. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2391.44s)]
*  I should get permanent access to the White House, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2397.28s)]
*  otherwise my free speech is being violated. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2399.28s)]
*  So I am going to go to the White House right now and insist. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2401.88s)]
*  I am much more well-known than that reporter is, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2403.92s)]
*  so it is a clear violation of 1A if they don't give me a pass, right? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2405.92s)]
*  He has used his power, his position to intimidate media. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2409.32s)]
*  He has used that to intimidate law firms. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2415.6s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2418.32s)]
*  When Anwar Al-Awlaki was assassinated, an extrajudicial assassination, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2419.7200000000003s)]
*  and a 16-year-old son by Obama, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2423.6s)]
*  the Democrats defended this and they said he should have had a better father. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2425.6s)]
*  No one cared. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2428.88s)]
*  Nobody cared. I know Cenk cared. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2429.96s)]
*  I know he's talked about it. I'm mad about it too. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2431.4s)]
*  So now when you come out, you say Trump is going to be impeached [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2433.52s)]
*  because he's doing things that are unpopular. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2435.64s)]
*  I'm personally offended. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2437.52s)]
*  It's not unpopular. It's illegal. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2438.56s)]
*  Murder of Americans, no one cares. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2440.36s)]
*  And you could, right now, file those impeachment articles, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2443.0s)]
*  we could get a criminal hearing and a conviction of Barack Obama [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2446.48s)]
*  for the murder of a 16-year-old. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2449.52s)]
*  This 16-year-old, Abdurahman Al-Awlaki, was not a combatant. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2451.56s)]
*  He was in a civilian restaurant in a country we are not at war with. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2454.72s)]
*  And why won't anyone do anything about it? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2457.56s)]
*  I'll throw a cherry on top. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2459.7999999999997s)]
*  When Donald Trump, in his first term, when he first gets elected, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2461.24s)]
*  he ordered a commando raid in Yemen, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2464.2s)]
*  which reportedly killed a seven-year-old American girl as well. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2466.68s)]
*  We don't have the same evidence on that one. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2469.56s)]
*  I want that criminally investigated as well. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2471.44s)]
*  How about you pursue those cases? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2473.68s)]
*  But you know what? You won't. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2475.2s)]
*  Because when it comes to bloviating nonsense [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2476.56s)]
*  pertaining to the economy or what Trump may or may not be doing, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2479.3999999999996s)]
*  no one ever goes after the war machine. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2482.0s)]
*  No one ever tries to target the extrajudicial authorities [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2484.32s)]
*  of the executive branch and their unilateral authority to declare war. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2487.6800000000003s)]
*  There's never been a war declared since World War II, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2491.04s)]
*  and you're not going to do anything about it. No one will. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2493.8s)]
*  Look, this president has personally gained through the meme coins. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2496.7200000000003s)]
*  This president has personally gained through the deal [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2501.96s)]
*  that he forced and intimidated... [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2505.44s)]
*  OK, but let me ask you then, Congressman, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2507.04s)]
*  do you believe that Joe Biden personally gained [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2509.36s)]
*  from what his son was up to in Ukraine, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2512.08s)]
*  working for energy companies for which he had zero experience, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2514.64s)]
*  and has now given back-dated pardons to all his family [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2518.32s)]
*  to protect any proper legitimate legal investigations [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2524.0s)]
*  of what they may or may not have been doing [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2528.48s)]
*  with countries like Ukraine and China? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2530.44s)]
*  When there's a widespread belief, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2532.4s)]
*  they're all putting money in their pockets. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2533.84s)]
*  Well, I'm just here as a member of Congress. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2536.84s)]
*  But it seems to me, with respect, though, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2540.96s)]
*  it just seems to me you are so blinded by totality of hatred to Trump [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2542.88s)]
*  and everything to do with him that you can't see the wood for the trees. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2548.6800000000003s)]
*  You can't praise him for anything. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2551.6800000000003s)]
*  And actually, you're not interested in any crimes [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2553.16s)]
*  committed by Democrat presidents. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2555.12s)]
*  You're not interested in any money-guzzling behaviour [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2557.52s)]
*  by the previous incumbent of the White House. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2561.8s)]
*  All you care about is Trump. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2564.2400000000002s)]
*  And it would have been a little bit more intellectually honest [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2566.08s)]
*  if you had cared a little bit more about what your own party were doing, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2568.72s)]
*  because they'd been up to a lot of no good for quite some time. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2572.68s)]
*  Well, look, I had had 12 in-person town halls in the last 40 days. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2576.12s)]
*  I've talked with hundreds and thousands of people all across America. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2581.24s)]
*  And people are... [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2586.56s)]
*  We're worried about now. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2589.68s)]
*  Donald Trump is the president today. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2591.72s)]
*  He's the president for the last 100 days. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2593.7999999999997s)]
*  His unconstitutional activities is what we are talking about here. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2596.32s)]
*  And that's what my impeachment action is all about. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2601.0400000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2603.96s)]
*  So that's really why I'm here. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2604.96s)]
*  This is... [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2605.96s)]
*  Quick, this is just a way to raise money. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2606.96s)]
*  Can we defend the congressman a little bit? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2608.96s)]
*  This is just an attempt to raise money for this congressman. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2611.2000000000003s)]
*  You're all going... [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2614.6000000000004s)]
*  You're all going to whataboutisms here. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2616.6000000000004s)]
*  And I can understand why, because Trump's in bad shape. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2618.6400000000003s)]
*  So you're going back to Obama. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2621.5600000000004s)]
*  Look, I agree with Tim on the Anwar al-Awlaki. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2623.0400000000004s)]
*  I'm the guy who brought it up. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2625.36s)]
*  I wonder if Tim agrees with me on cutting the Pentagon, because Tim, you and I agreed [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2626.56s)]
*  on cutting the Pentagon when I was on his show. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2629.92s)]
*  And now all of a sudden they're not cutting. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2632.36s)]
*  They're adding $150 billion. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2633.96s)]
*  So they're frauds, right? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2635.7200000000003s)]
*  Let's be honest about that, right? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2636.7200000000003s)]
*  So, but we're going to whataboutisms here. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2638.6800000000003s)]
*  We can go back to global Cleveland, if you guys like, right? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2640.44s)]
*  We can go back to James Polk, if you guys like. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2643.28s)]
*  But you're trying to distract from what's happening with Trump. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2645.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm perfectly willing to criticize all the other Democrats in the past for all the things [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2648.1200000000003s)]
*  that they've done wrong. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2651.76s)]
*  But right now we've got to rescue the country. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2653.04s)]
*  And so at this point, there's two different problems. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2655.92s)]
*  One is that Trump keeps doing things that are unconstitutional. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2659.12s)]
*  And to your earlier point, Piers, that is not what people voted for. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2661.96s)]
*  In fact, the reason Trump disavowed Project 2025 was because it was really unpopular. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2665.24s)]
*  Now that he's actually doing Project 2025, yeah, it's really unpopular. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2669.4s)]
*  But what about this, Shane? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2673.24s)]
*  What about this, Shane? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2674.24s)]
*  They just want... [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2675.24s)]
*  But Shane, but what about this? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2676.24s)]
*  Look, I saw what Caroline Levitt said in her statement about 100 days. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2677.24s)]
*  In his first 100 days, Donald Trump's delivered on hundreds of promises [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2680.72s)]
*  and already accomplished his two most important campaign goals. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2684.24s)]
*  The border is secure and inflation is ending. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2687.2s)]
*  The next 100 days will consist of trade deals, peace deals and tax cuts. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2689.52s)]
*  More American greatness on this way. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2694.16s)]
*  Now, putting aside any partisan kind of flavor to all this, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2695.44s)]
*  and putting aside that clearly right now things look quite bad for Trump, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2698.48s)]
*  I could easily see a situation in 100 days' time, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2703.52s)]
*  maybe not quite as quick as that, but certainly not far off it, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2707.48s)]
*  where he might well have got a number of advantageous trade deals done, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2710.36s)]
*  including China, where he could have forged peace in Ukraine, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2715.36s)]
*  bringing an end to that war, and might well have done the same in Gaza, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2719.0800000000004s)]
*  in which case he would be odds on to win the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2723.52s)]
*  I mean, this is not... [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2727.04s)]
*  In other words, it's all very turbulent, it's all very chaotic, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2728.04s)]
*  but I could absolutely see a pathway to that all happening in the next few months. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2731.96s)]
*  It could happen. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2737.4s)]
*  What if he turns into an angel? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2739.36s)]
*  What if he turns into Santa Claus? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2741.36s)]
*  Which part of that do you think may not happen? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2743.08s)]
*  Give an out-presence to everybody. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2746.08s)]
*  Which part of that may not happen? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2747.08s)]
*  I think all of it might not happen. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2749.08s)]
*  In fact, Piers, I think absolutely none of that is going to happen. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2750.08s)]
*  That's why I formed Rebellion PAC to give people a left-wing populist alternative. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2754.36s)]
*  Real economic populism. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2759.56s)]
*  People should go check out RebellionPAC.com, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2761.28s)]
*  because we've got guys like Ro Khanna, Richard O'Jenna and other people [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2763.8s)]
*  who are actual populists who are going to do the things that Trump promised [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2766.92s)]
*  on the economic end and has not delivered. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2770.2000000000003s)]
*  So, Piers, could he do one or two trade deals and then call it a day [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2772.92s)]
*  and pretend that he got a victory? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2776.6800000000003s)]
*  He could, but it wasn't a victory. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2778.32s)]
*  And if he keeps these tariffs on with China and others, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2780.2400000000002s)]
*  soon we're going to have empty shelves, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2783.76s)]
*  and all of this bloviating is going to be totally irrelevant, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2785.12s)]
*  because once those empty shelves hit or the higher prices hit... [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2788.96s)]
*  I mean, we had the stock market downturn. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2792.28s)]
*  That's not even the big problem. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2794.08s)]
*  That's already... He's already hit an iceberg with that, but that's the tip. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2795.88s)]
*  The actual iceberg is the American people. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2799.7200000000003s)]
*  And when their prices start going up and when they start seeing empty shelves, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2802.1600000000003s)]
*  they're going to be furious, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2805.92s)]
*  because it's the exact opposite of what they voted for. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2807.36s)]
*  And then you guys can come on here and start talking about Chester Hawthorne, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2810.92s)]
*  but it ain't going to make a difference. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2814.36s)]
*  Don't worry, I'm going to get everybody back in 100 days, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2815.7200000000003s)]
*  because I've got a feeling it won't play out how you think, Chet. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2817.76s)]
*  But I may be wrong. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2820.92s)]
*  Carrie. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2821.96s)]
*  I love the fact that Cenk calls what he does all day bloviating. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2822.96s)]
*  I agree, and I think if we pulled that, most of America would agree. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2825.88s)]
*  But President Trump has to do the hard work. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2829.92s)]
*  He's assembled an administration full of hardworking human beings. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2832.28s)]
*  Sometimes they have a misstep, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2836.56s)]
*  but they're heading in the right direction for America. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2838.56s)]
*  It's not an easy job. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2841.6800000000003s)]
*  He's taking a lot of criticism, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2843.4s)]
*  because people like Cenk have to bloviate all day to use his words, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2844.88s)]
*  and he's got to have something to talk about. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2848.6s)]
*  No, I'm pontificating. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2850.68s)]
*  He would lose the audience he has if he started talking about [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2852.16s)]
*  how incredible this agenda has been and the rolling out of this agenda. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2855.48s)]
*  It's not going to be perfect. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2860.44s)]
*  We're living in a real world here, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2862.04s)]
*  and we're having to pick up the pieces and clean up [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2863.8799999999997s)]
*  after a dismal administration that the congressman sat by [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2866.52s)]
*  and didn't do anything about. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2870.64s)]
*  I never heard, first of all, I've never heard of this gentleman. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2871.64s)]
*  I never heard him talk about how disastrous the economy was under Joe Biden. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2874.44s)]
*  And I think it's really appalling for the people of Michigan. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2880.16s)]
*  It used to be a middle-class state. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2884.2s)]
*  It is an important state when it comes to our automaking here in America, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2887.16s)]
*  the industry, and to hear that there is a congressman from Michigan [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2890.7599999999998s)]
*  who is opposed to this tariff plan to bring back the manufacturing [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2894.44s)]
*  we so desperately need and the middle-class needs in Michigan [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2898.8399999999997s)]
*  and all 50 states. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2902.16s)]

*  And just putting these tariffs on foreign countries [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2914.52s)]
*  just doesn't solve the problem. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2917.48s)]

*  These tariffs are not good for Michigan, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2928.56s)]
*  and these tariffs are not good for America, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2931.12s)]
*  and these tariffs are raising American prices. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2933.32s)]
*  This is like a Trump sales tax on consumer goods for America. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2936.08s)]
*  Let me bring in Bhatia. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2940.16s)]

*  And we've just seen what I would think is quite a worrying moment [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2962.44s)]
*  for the Trump camp, which is what's happened in Canada, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2965.8s)]
*  where you've got a liberal candidate who's come from, you know, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2970.2000000000003s)]

*  You know, I just think he's got to be careful, Donald Trump. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2983.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, I could absolutely see this working, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=2985.96s)]

*  The question is... [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3044.88s)]
*  So I'm just saying, like, it was going to... [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3045.7200000000003s)]
*  It's the tactic. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3047.7200000000003s)]
*  Nobody else had any idea how... [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3048.84s)]
*  I don't think anyone disagrees with the overarching narrative [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3051.12s)]
*  that Trump has laid out, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3057.52s)]
*  which is China's been ripping off America for decades. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3059.64s)]
*  It has. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3062.2799999999997s)]
*  As you say, it owns a lot of American debt, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3063.44s)]
*  very bad for America. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3065.48s)]
*  All the experts in the American economy [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3066.92s)]
*  have led to an economy with $37 trillion of American debt. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3069.4s)]
*  If that's a success, I'd hate to say a failure. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3073.72s)]
*  You know, this is an economy that Elon Musk keeps warning [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3076.2s)]
*  is extremely perilous longer term [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3079.04s)]
*  and could easily end up with America going bankrupt. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3082.56s)]
*  So Trump is doing radical stuff. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3085.6s)]
*  I get it. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3087.28s)]
*  The question is, will the way he's going about this, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3088.12s)]
*  as many economic experts fear, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3091.76s)]
*  will it blow up in his face and make things a lot worse? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3094.76s)]
*  It could. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3097.8s)]
*  So here's the point, Piers. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3099.2s)]
*  No one else had the guts, the courage or a plan [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3101.68s)]
*  for how to address this. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3106.8s)]
*  Getting yourself weaned off of an addiction [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3108.4s)]
*  to cheap crap from China was always going to be difficult. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3111.2400000000002s)]
*  And that is why nobody did anything about it. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3115.84s)]
*  Even though, as you say, Piers, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3118.2000000000003s)]
*  we all agree that this had to happen. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3120.0s)]
*  There was no easy way to do that. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3122.6s)]
*  There was no easy way to get countries around the world [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3124.56s)]
*  who have been fleecing us with their tariffs [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3127.6800000000003s)]
*  to suddenly decide, oh, you know what? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3130.32s)]
*  Maybe this is not okay. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3132.56s)]
*  Maybe we should stop enriching our elites [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3133.6400000000003s)]
*  on the backs of the American working class. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3135.52s)]
*  What Trump did was he actually, it's really amazing. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3137.88s)]
*  There is now a 10% global tariff, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3141.44s)]
*  which the world is actually relieved about [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3144.4s)]
*  because it came down from the heights of Liberation Day. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3147.44s)]
*  Like, do you understand what a feat that was? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3150.2400000000002s)]
*  That that is seen as an improvement from countries [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3152.48s)]
*  that for decades have been fleecing us [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3155.28s)]
*  with their own tariffs. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3157.32s)]
*  So this was always going to be hard. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3158.8s)]
*  I have not heard a single other plan [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3160.84s)]
*  for how to get American manufacturing back to America. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3163.4s)]
*  And it's just nonsense that Trump hasn't done that. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3165.96s)]
*  He has $1.5 trillion in manufacturing committed [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3167.92s)]
*  since the day that he took office. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3173.0s)]
*  Nobody else was able to do that. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3174.96s)]
*  And to do that, you need a carrot and you need a stick [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3177.04s)]
*  because American corporations [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3180.56s)]
*  are not suddenly gonna wake up and be like, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3182.2400000000002s)]
*  oh, maybe having a sense of what it means [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3184.2000000000003s)]
*  to have prosperity for our entire nation [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3187.0s)]
*  is more important than our quarterly reports. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3189.4s)]
*  That was never gonna happen without a little bit of pain. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3191.48s)]
*  Okay, I wanna wrap things by asking all of you. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3194.12s)]
*  I wanna ask all of you to give Trump a grade. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3197.56s)]
*  We can have A to E or an F for fail. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3200.48s)]
*  Cenk, the 100 day grade for the president, Trump. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3204.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3210.64s)]
*  Look, because he's so wildly unconstitutional, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3212.3199999999997s)]
*  I wanna give him an F minus, but I'm fair. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3214.8399999999997s)]
*  He did close the border and he is taking a lot of action. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3217.2s)]
*  I think it's bad action, but at least it's something. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3220.92s)]
*  So I'll give him a solid D. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3223.48s)]
*  A solid D. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3225.64s)]
*  Batia? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3227.08s)]
*  A plus, but I really admire it, Cenk, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3229.92s)]
*  because I see you struggling to be fair. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3232.16s)]
*  And even though I disagree with you, I admire that. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3234.08s)]
*  I have to give him an A plus. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3235.96s)]
*  I think this has been, I never expected a president [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3237.4s)]
*  to fulfill this many campaign promises ever. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3240.36s)]
*  Certainly not in 100 days. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3243.76s)]
*  Before I ask you, Carrie, just to be clear, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3244.6s)]
*  you can't go above an A plus. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3246.32s)]
*  You can't do two pluses? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3249.88s)]
*  No. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3251.56s)]
*  Well, I'm gonna give him an A plus [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3252.64s)]
*  because he has followed through on his campaign promises. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3254.08s)]
*  The people of this country are getting what they voted for [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3258.6s)]
*  and they're ecstatic about it. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3261.24s)]
*  And I believe that this congressman [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3262.68s)]
*  will really regret the day when he looks back historically [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3265.3599999999997s)]
*  and sees what an incredible, transformative president, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3268.68s)]
*  President Trump will go down in history, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3271.72s)]
*  he will be embarrassed about it. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3273.24s)]
*  I cannot take this fake impeachment garbage seriously [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3274.52s)]

*  He needs to get serious. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3283.04s)]
*  Wow, wow, wow. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3284.04s)]
*  Go, go, go. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3285.44s)]
*  And start fighting for the people of Michigan [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3286.28s)]
*  and stop fighting the president [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3288.28s)]
*  who's trying to help the people of Michigan. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3290.04s)]
*  You, when you don't have a good argument, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3292.28s)]
*  you attack personally. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3295.12s)]
*  That's what you do. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3296.68s)]
*  Look, this president has done [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3297.88s)]
*  illegal unconstitutional activities. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3302.16s)]
*  He has ruined the economy. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3305.7599999999998s)]
*  People have having bias remorse about him. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3308.24s)]
*  Okay, give me a grade, congressman. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3310.9199999999996s)]
*  I would give him an F minus. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3312.9199999999996s)]
*  F minus, okay. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3315.2s)]
*  For the damage that he has created. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3316.04s)]
*  And here's a fact for you, Kari Lee, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3318.16s)]
*  you may want to think about. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3320.6s)]
*  The congressman, I've just been told, is 70 years old. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3322.0s)]
*  You look about 50. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3324.8799999999997s)]
*  What's your secret? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3326.52s)]
*  That's great. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3327.3599999999997s)]
*  It's not about me, it's about America. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3328.2s)]
*  He should be more wise. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3330.16s)]
*  At the age of 70, I would hope he'd be more wise. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3332.12s)]
*  Can we at least agree, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3334.8399999999997s)]
*  he looks the most useful 70-year-old. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3335.8399999999997s)]
*  I think we've ever had an uncensored. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3338.6s)]
*  So he may have a squirrel on his head, not my words. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3340.0s)]
*  Yours, Miss Lake, but he looks pretty good, a 70. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3342.76s)]
*  He looks amazing for 70. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3346.76s)]
*  Look, I want America to look good [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3348.92s)]
*  and America's economy to do better [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3351.32s)]
*  and American people be able to afford things [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3353.6800000000003s)]
*  and have a better life. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3356.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, the beauty of all this [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3357.32s)]
*  is I can get you all back in 100. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3358.52s)]

*  He had a technical issue there. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3363.32s)]
*  I'm going to think that Tim, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3364.7200000000003s)]
*  I think he would have given him a B, I think, if he was fair. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3366.2s)]
*  Possibly an A, but I think he may have gone B. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3369.7599999999998s)]
*  I think he would have given him an A. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3371.64s)]
*  Maybe, we'll find out afterwards. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3373.52s)]
*  And if I got that wrong, I'll correct it next week. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3375.48s)]
*  But thank you all very much to my team. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3377.96s)]

*  There are only 10,000 days left of Trump [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3383.6s)]
*  unless he decides to run again. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF18fqjaehg&t=3386.08s)]
