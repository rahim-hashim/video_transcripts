Video Description: Former US president Joe Biden has sadly revealed he’s been diagnosed with prostate cancer - and predictably, alongside messages of love and support, there’s been cries of a cover-up by the Democrats all along.

Piers Morgan speaks to Dr Marc Siegel, who believes Biden’s condition was probably known when he took office in 2021. But how grave is his condition now?

Then, President Trump is reshaping the political map in the Middle East and has put in another call to President Putin and Netanyahu has gone too far in Gaza.

Joining Piers Morgan to debate all this is former US diplomat and co-host of ‘The Ex Files James Rubin, founder and host of ‘The Young Turks’ Cenk Uygur, former IDF spokesperson Doron Spielman, head of the Libertarian institute and author of ‘Provoked’ Scott Horton and White House correspondent Natalie Winters.

Then Jeffrey Sachs joins Uncensored to give his take on the latest in Ukraine and Gaza.

# ‘MASSIVE Cover-Up!’ Joe Biden Cancer Diagnosis + Gaza Debate Goes WILD
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY)
*  Prostate cancer doesn't occur overnight, whether it's aggressive or not, it grows slowly. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't automatically believe that we're being told the whole story here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=5.2s)]
*  How's that been, do you think, a massive cover-up here? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=8.8s)]
*  We all saw it in public appearances. It was super obvious. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=11.44s)]
*  He would shake hands with invisible people. This is not a close case. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=16.0s)]
*  Please spare us this apologist nonsense for the great man of Joe Biden. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=20.0s)]
*  Was he performatively always perfect? Clearly not. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=26.24s)]
*  Remember, adrenaline flows when you're confronted with a crisis. We all know that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  It's an absolutely asinine take. The guy was obviously sick from day one while he was in office. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=35.12s)]
*  Truly one of the largest, I would say, health scandals, bigger than Watergate, of our time. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  President Trump reshapes the political map in the Middle East and calls President Putin. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=46.72s)]
*  Netanyahu goes too far in Gaza. Plenty to debate, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=51.04s)]
*  but we have to begin with the shocking news, of course, of former President Biden's cancer diagnosis. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=54.56s)]
*  This far advanced, meaning Gleason 9 metastasized to the bone, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  the five-year survival rate is somewhere between 30 and 40 percent. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  Again, depending on how well he responds to therapy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  I mean, he must have had the best possible care here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm a little taken aback that it's this far advanced and very, very concerned about it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=77.84s)]
*  Well, we'll hear from Dr. Siegel again shortly. Dr. Zika Manuel, an oncologist who worked closely [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=82.72s)]
*  with former President Barack Obama, said this morning there is no way that Biden developed [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=88.8s)]
*  this in the past 200 days, and he probably had it at the beginning of his presidency. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=93.28s)]
*  So how was this not picked up by the world-class physicians who examine him regularly? Or was it [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=98.4s)]
*  picked up? And there's been another cover-up that would be truly shocking. But this is a shocking [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  story on many levels. It's shocking to hear such a bleak prognosis from a man who, a year ago, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=108.32s)]
*  was still campaigning to be president. On a human level, it's shocking that so many people have [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  immediately made this an issue of bitter partisan tribal politics. The only correct and humane [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=117.6s)]
*  response is to surely wish Joe Biden and his family well as he now fights for his life. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=123.6s)]
*  That is exactly what President Trump did with a classy and restrained statement. He simply said, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=129.2s)]
*  We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=134.24s)]
*  recovery. Instead, many of his supporters immediately began mocking Biden, celebrating his illness [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=138.88s)]
*  in heartless posts which are currently all over social media. There's no doubt it would be exactly [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  the same, I suspect a lot worse actually, if this story was about President Trump. Joe Biden was [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=147.68s)]
*  unfit for office. That's a fact. I've said it many times. Biden's inner circle cover-up reduced [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  decline with the help of a complicit media which felt it was his duty to stop Trump. That's a fact, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  too. But it's also a fact that an old man has very aggressive cancer. And if your first reaction [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=163.2s)]
*  to that news is to be gleeful or ecstatic or to mock him, then you're frankly a despicable human [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  being. Before I introduce the panel, I'm joined by Dr. Mark Siegel, the Fox News Senior Medical [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  Analyst. Dr. Mark, great to have you back on Uncensored, a bombshell piece of news last night [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=181.6s)]
*  involving the health of former President Joe Biden. I think my sort of fundamental question [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=187.52s)]
*  for you is this. How serious is it? It seems on the face of it very serious for a man in his 80s [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=194.0s)]
*  to have stage five prostate cancer, very aggressive, very advanced and metastasizing [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=200.8s)]
*  into his bones. Just on the face of it to a layman seems extremely serious. But also what something [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=207.28s)]
*  Ezekiel Emanuel said on MSNBC this morning and your reaction to that. Let's play this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  Oh, more than several years. You don't get prostate cancer. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  Again, I just want to stop you. So this is not speculation. If you have prostate cancer [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=224.8s)]
*  that is spread to the bone, then most certainly you are saying had it when he was President of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  the United States. Oh, yeah. He did not develop it in the last 100, 200 days. He had it while he [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=238.56s)]
*  was President. He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. So Dr. Mark, first of all, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=246.48s)]
*  how serious do you think his current condition is? And secondly, your response to what Ezekiel [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=255.36s)]
*  Emanuel said. His current condition is very serious because it's been diagnosed under the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=261.28s)]
*  microscope, Gleason 9, phase five, which means it's about as aggressive as any prostate cancer [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=267.68s)]
*  can be. And that means that it has the ability to spread even further than the one metastasis [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=275.36s)]
*  to the bone. The statistics on this is under 40% five-year survival rate in that category. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=283.04s)]
*  Metastatic prostate cancer to the bone under 40%. On top of that, the aggressivity, I would think, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=292.88s)]
*  would make it worse. The only thing on the positive column is that they're reporting that, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=298.8s)]
*  Piers, it does seem to be responsive to anti-testosterone therapy, which is very [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  typically given. A lot of side effects, including fatigue and decreased libido. But if there's a [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=309.36s)]
*  lot of testosterone associated with this tumor, then treating it that way will help. A lot is [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  going to depend on the first few months and the response to this systemic therapy. But he's in a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=320.32s)]
*  category where he is more likely to not live five years than to live five years tragically. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=326.56s)]
*  And in relation to this suggestion that he must have had this for several years, maybe even going [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=333.84s)]
*  back to when he won the White House in 2020, what do you feel about that? Well, Piers, first of all, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=340.56s)]
*  let's remember that we're about a day away from reporting the fact that we're not getting the true [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=347.44s)]
*  health story from this White House, from the Biden White House. I mean, we just reported that, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=352.32s)]
*  that we believe that he was cognitively impaired for his whole term. And I was reporting on that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  four or five years ago, White House keeping glowing physicals about his cognition. How can we then [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=362.32s)]
*  jump from there to assume that whatever they write right now is completely accurate and fully [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=368.56s)]
*  disclosed? And as Ezekiel Emmanuel, who's an oncologist, by the way, ultra Democrat, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=373.52s)]
*  saying he likely had it throughout his term, I believe that's true. Prostate cancer doesn't [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=379.2s)]
*  occur overnight, whether it's aggressive or not. It grows slowly, usually. Maybe it grew slowly, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=383.84s)]
*  and then it turned into this aggressiveness. I don't know when this was diagnosed. I think [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=389.35999999999996s)]
*  it's really important to say that we screen people. And even if the official recommendations [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=394.88s)]
*  in the United States are not to routinely screen people over 70, I frankly disagree with that, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=400.8s)]
*  because the treatments we have are so phenomenal now that we should be screening people over 70, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=406.08s)]
*  over 80. People are riding bicycles like the former president, and he should be screened. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=411.92s)]
*  Was he screened? I hope he was screened. I would be shocked if he wasn't. And if he was, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=416.24s)]
*  what did they find? And when did they find him? And did they disclose it? But I don't automatically [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=421.76s)]
*  believe that we're being told the whole story here. No, I agree. And if what Ezekiel Emmanuel [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=428.16s)]
*  says is right, and he's a very eminent oncologist, it defies credulity, frankly, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  that given the amount of medical testing a president of the United States must have on [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  a routine basis, that it would not include a basic test for prostate cancer, because [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=446.32000000000005s)]
*  all men over a certain age are encouraged to do that all the time. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=451.68s)]
*  You know, Piers, that's true, and it gets even beyond that. You have your routine PSA, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=456.0s)]
*  which is about 70% sensitive for prostate cancer. Then you can do a free PSA, which if it's low, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=462.0s)]
*  indicates prostate cancer. We now have a urine test for biomarkers for prostate cancer. There's [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  genetic profiling you can do. There's so many things you could do to a president of the United [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=474.88s)]
*  States to be screening for this, that it'd be a very high likelihood that you would pick it up [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=479.52s)]
*  in advance. Also, of course, the prostate nodule, you know, probably has been there for a while as [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=484.08s)]
*  well. This story doesn't jive entirely. You know, I'm not saying, by the way, to your viewers, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=489.68s)]
*  that you couldn't have advanced prostate cancer and not know it. It's hard for me to believe that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=498.0s)]
*  you're the president of the United States and you advanced prostate cancer and not know it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=502.4s)]
*  And one more point. You and I talk all the time about royalty in England not telling us about [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=507.2s)]
*  their health. Why would this be any different? We have a long history in the United States about [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=513.52s)]
*  not disclosing the health of presidents. And if you had an advanced and aggressive form of cancer, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=519.12s)]
*  could it impair your cognitive ability in the way that we clearly saw demonstrated by Joe Biden in [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=526.4s)]
*  the last 18 months to two years? In other words, if he had it, and let's assume for a moment he had [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=532.96s)]
*  it but wasn't aware of it and it wasn't picked up, and I think that's a big leap, frankly, given [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  the scale of medical treatments he would have had and medical attention he would have had in [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=543.52s)]
*  testing and so on. But let's assume that is the case. Could that have had an impact on his [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=548.72s)]
*  cognitive abilities? Let me answer that in a statistical way. I know what you're getting at, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=554.08s)]
*  and I want to answer it this way. Prostate cancer goes from the prostate to the lymph nodes [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=561.44s)]
*  to the bone. I don't believe it's likely that he had a metastasis to the brain, which would [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=568.72s)]
*  impair cognition potentially. But I do think that if it was diagnosed a few years ago, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  the way Zika Emanuel is saying, and he got some kind of treatment, radiation therapy or immunotherapy [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=579.44s)]

*  awful lot of hellish health situations in his life. His son died of brain cancer. He lost his wife and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=606.72s)]
*  baby in a car crash. He's had a lot of health issues himself. He's now facing, it looks like, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  a pretty serious threat to his life with this. And I think on a human level, I've been very dismayed [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=619.12s)]
*  by some of the kind of vitriol, the mockery, the open abuse and all the rest of it that's come as [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=624.24s)]
*  a result of that announcement. It's not good. I want to comment on that briefly. I'm so glad [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=632.16s)]

*  and I have a book coming out on this in the fall, is that that type of strength will help him in his [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=657.12s)]

*  But we can't not start, I think, with this bombshell news. Let me start with you, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=778.48s)]
*  James Rubin, who's been very plugged into the Democrats for a long time. I think there are [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=782.6400000000001s)]
*  several aspects of this extraordinary revelation about Joe Biden's health. But the most pertinent, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=787.28s)]
*  it seems to me, is a lot of oncologists like Ezekiel Manuel have come out and said it is simply [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  impossible for this not to have been detected a lot earlier than not just last week, but years ago. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=800.88s)]
*  And especially if you're the president of the United States and you're having [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=809.6s)]
*  medicals all the time. Has there been, do you think, a massive cover-up here? Or is this [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=811.44s)]
*  conspiracy theory mayhem running riot? I haven't the faintest idea about a doctor. I really wouldn't [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=817.0400000000001s)]
*  know. What I do know, and what I think is getting lost in this discussion, is that as a mistake as [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=824.4000000000001s)]
*  it was to run for reelection, as he did for several months and then stood down, President Biden had a [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=831.9200000000001s)]
*  good presidency and our country was better off for it. And all this discussion of performativeness [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=837.76s)]
*  about communications and was he an older man and this and that, he made good decisions. He made [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=844.3199999999999s)]
*  good judgments. The United States and the West were better off because he decided to stand up [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=850.3199999999999s)]
*  to Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine. And I don't think there's any other Democrat who [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=855.76s)]
*  would have done what Joe Biden did, which is stand up to Putin, gather world leaders together, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=860.48s)]
*  and really put the pressure on in defense of Ukraine. Whether the Trump would have, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=866.48s)]
*  I think is doubtful. And I suspect that some of the other Democrats, as Barack Obama was in 2014, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=871.04s)]
*  would have been reluctant to stand up to Vladimir Putin. So the big issue of our time is not what [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=877.12s)]
*  did or didn't happen during the oncology exams. It's whether we're going to stand up to face [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=884.08s)]
*  a Russia that is militarized, that is supported by the world's largest military buildup in the [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=889.84s)]
*  world in China. And is the West going to respond to that? And these are the issues that I focus on. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=896.96s)]
*  I don't really know the details. But aren't the two, I mean look, yeah, but James, aren't the two [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=902.72s)]
*  inexorably interlinked in the sense that the person charged with making potentially enormous [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=907.0400000000001s)]
*  decisions in how you combat somebody like Vladimir Putin, potentially even down to considering [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=913.84s)]
*  the deployment of nuclear weapons, that that person, it was pretty obvious the last two years [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=919.84s)]
*  of his presidency, his cognitive decline was rapid, his physical decline was rapid. And this new book [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=925.6800000000001s)]
*  by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, which is a number one bestseller now, but this new book, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=932.48s)]
*  it carries just endless revelations, very well sourced revelations, that Biden simply wasn't fit [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=937.52s)]
*  for office in that last period of his presidency. So I don't disagree with you that the situation [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=944.32s)]
*  with Putin was an enormously important thing, or that Biden went some way to try and to [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=951.36s)]
*  tackle him in Ukraine. Where I dispute is the fact that it's sort of either or to me, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=958.1600000000001s)]
*  if the president of the United States is not fit for office and he has to deal with someone [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=963.6s)]
*  like Vladimir Putin, that's an incredibly dangerous situation for the United States and the world. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=967.84s)]
*  Do you accept that? And not in the least, Joe Biden was president for four years. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=973.6s)]
*  I worked very, very closely with him as a young man and I didn't work with him as president, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=979.76s)]
*  but Tony Blinken, who was the secretary of state, did. I spoke to him yesterday about this, knowing [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=984.4s)]
*  these kinds of questions are coming out. And it was his observation that when it came to decisions [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=989.12s)]
*  about war and peace, nuclear threats or no nuclear threats, gathering together the West, dealing with [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=994.8000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu's government, dealing with the Chinese, that he never observed a failure of judgment on [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1001.44s)]
*  the part of the president. Was he performatively always perfect? Clearly not. He made that decision [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1007.6800000000001s)]
*  for himself that he couldn't run for another term. But to jump to that and say, because he might have [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1015.36s)]
*  had a state cancer diagnosis, he wasn't fit to be president is a real big leap for me. I believe [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1020.96s)]
*  President Biden made very good decisions in foreign affairs where I know something about it, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1027.36s)]
*  where I observed the decisions, where I've been in this business for 35 years. And I know how hard [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1032.1599999999999s)]
*  it is for presidents to make decisions to both confront Putin, but avoid the risk of nuclear war. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1037.12s)]
*  President Trump is obsessed with the risk of nuclear war. If you ask him what pissed him off [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1043.84s)]
*  about Zelensky in the White House office was when Zelensky suggested there were risks to the United [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1048.3999999999999s)]
*  States. So Joe Biden stood up to Vladimir Putin, gathered the West, confronted Russia and avoided [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1054.48s)]
*  the risk of world war using the subtlety and decision making that he had as president. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1062.16s)]
*  And his secretary of state has testified to me, and I believe him, this is an honest man, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1067.6s)]
*  that he never observed in the conduct of foreign affairs, in the conduct of foreign affairs, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1072.0s)]
*  he never observed the decision making cognitive failures that are being attributed to Joe Biden [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1077.76s)]
*  because he had a bad debate night or was an old man who occasionally did forget names, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1084.56s)]
*  who occasionally had a bad memory. But when he was confronted with crisis, remember adrenaline [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1089.12s)]
*  flows when you're confronted with a crisis. We all know that, Piers, you know that perfectly well. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1093.76s)]
*  Yeah, you do, but I want to say- [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1098.48s)]
*  You can be very tired and old, but adrenaline flows when you're president [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1099.36s)]
*  and you make good decisions. And I've had that testified to me by Secretary of State [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1103.36s)]
*  and I trust him. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1108.6399999999999s)]
*  Okay, Cenk Uygur, so look, we've got it all wrong. When it came to the big decisions, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1109.6s)]
*  Biden was spot on. I don't really accept the adrenaline thing simply because the president [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1115.1999999999998s)]
*  of the United States shouldn't need an adrenaline rush to make good decisions. It would be my [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1120.0s)]
*  observation, James, but I hate you. You've spoken to well-sourced people, high level, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1123.6799999999998s)]
*  and some of them have been out there saying, you know what, he was fine when it came to big [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1128.24s)]
*  decisions. Cenk, your response to this, and I guess the big question is going to be, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1132.08s)]
*  if these oncologists are correct in what they're saying, that he must have had this for several [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1136.72s)]
*  years at least to have progressed to the stage where it metastasized to his bones, then was there [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1142.48s)]
*  a cover-up and is the cognitive issue we're talking about actually connected to the fact [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1148.96s)]
*  that all this time he's had aggressive cancer? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1153.84s)]
*  Yeah, so let's establish things that make sense. So first of all, now at this point, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1156.72s)]
*  President Biden has a very serious form of cancer, so my heart goes out to him and his family, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1162.24s)]
*  and this isn't personal. But at the same time, we have to be honest about what got us into this [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1168.96s)]
*  mess, because it isn't about Biden. It's about, do you just bow your head to power and the demands [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1175.68s)]
*  to power, including the gaslighting and the absurdity. So Democratic leadership told us [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1183.36s)]
*  that Joe Biden was fine mentally, physically, and they told us that a thousand times. They were [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1191.04s)]
*  lying. It was obvious that he was not fine. I don't need to be a doctor. I didn't need to be [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1196.32s)]
*  an insider that was with him 24 hours a day. We all saw it in public appearances. It was super [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1201.68s)]
*  obvious. He would shake hands with invisible people. This is not a close case. He would [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1208.32s)]
*  mumble. He would say things like, we defeated Medicare. Come on. So now I'm supposed to sit [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1214.0s)]
*  here and listen to this absurdity about how he was such a great decision-maker when the [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1219.04s)]
*  adrenaline was flowing through him. Adrenaline can lead to bad decisions, and this is just [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1224.4s)]
*  preposterous all around. So did they know that he had this type of cancer? Well, there's only two [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1228.88s)]
*  possible answers. One is Biden said, don't test me. And maybe because he was worried that they [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1233.52s)]
*  would come up with things that would show that he shouldn't be president. And he had, let's be [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1239.04s)]
*  honest, infinite greed, infinite ego. And it had to be him. It had to be him. Tax Day has passed, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1243.2s)]
*  but for millions of Americans, that's where the trouble begins. The IRS is now ramping up [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1249.6s)]

*  and I've watched over 20 years how Democrats respond to Vladimir Putin, the last Democratic [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1427.2s)]
*  president, President Obama, didn't respond to the war in Ukraine, and Joe Biden was advocating for [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1433.2s)]

*  We can, you know, all the rest of this stuff is about politics and establishment and anti-establishment [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1445.76s)]

*  say with confidence that of the various leaders of the Democratic Party, Joe Biden was the one most [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1454.56s)]
*  likely to respond in the most aggressive way to Vladimir Putin's evasion. I say that with great [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1460.8799999999999s)]
*  confidence despite what your colleague suggested. Okay. Natalie, before I get your general response [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1467.52s)]
*  to this story, I've been really shocked. I went on X last night because within minutes of me posting [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1474.96s)]
*  the news with the statement from the Biden family, which is, you know, indisputable in what it said. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1482.4s)]
*  This was stage five, very aggressive prostate cancer that had metastasized into his bones. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1488.8s)]
*  If you're in your 80s and that has happened to you, you are fighting for your life, and, you know, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1495.04s)]
*  I just need an expert to tell you you're in very serious danger of losing your life. And in that [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1500.24s)]
*  moment, it just seemed to me the only humane response is to wish him well. You can have all [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1505.84s)]
*  your other debates and arguments, you know, over the next few days as people have been doing the [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1510.8s)]
*  last few months. That's fine. But at least give the man, you know, 24 hours of decency and humanity, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1514.64s)]
*  as I would expect if it was Donald Trump or if it was anybody else. But I was struck by the venom [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1521.6s)]
*  that poured out. And I then posted again, said, look, you know, whatever, whatever your politics [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1528.48s)]
*  here, come on, this is sick. What is going on? Just show some respect to this guy. 50 years of [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1533.52s)]
*  public service fighting for his life. But no, that just made it worse. There was a tidal wave of [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1539.04s)]
*  filth on social media, mockery, glee, ecstasy, willing him to die quickly, not a shred of humanity [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1545.36s)]
*  pervading so much of what I saw. And I was I wasn't just disappointed or angry about it. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1555.52s)]
*  I was genuinely shocked. How has it come to this? How has our society come to this place [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1561.6s)]
*  where partisan politics is so tribal, so bitter, so uncompromising, that actually even when a man [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1567.92s)]
*  in his 80s is fighting for his life from a deadly cancer, that that is a moment to mock him and be [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1574.96s)]
*  gleeful and hope he dies? Yeah, it's gross. I mean, I obviously condemn that. I'm sure everyone on [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1582.4s)]
*  the panel agrees with me. But I think let's not be myopic. I think we see it certainly on both sides, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1590.8000000000002s)]
*  right? I think with President Trump's two assassination attempts, you have Comey posting the 8647 [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1596.4s)]
*  stones. It's a cultural shift. But of course, of course. But I think that that's sort of [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1602.0800000000002s)]
*  tangential to the assure a separate thing. I think the anger that is sort of seeding that [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1608.48s)]
*  is an outrage for respectfully people who will come on this program. I would say that you should [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1613.6000000000001s)]
*  maybe study the prerequisites to be commander in chief or the president of the United States. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1618.3200000000002s)]
*  I think it's more than just a surge of adrenaline that maybe gives you a 50% chance to maybe make a [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1623.2s)]
*  good decision. I'd also posit that maybe certain other presidential candidates, whether President [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1628.64s)]
*  Trump or Democrats, wouldn't have actually had to have stood up to Putin because he wouldn't have [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1634.08s)]
*  invaded like he didn't under President Trump because they wouldn't have had someone who was [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1638.96s)]
*  essentially dead either from a mental cognizance perspective or even just an actual health [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1643.12s)]
*  standard. And I think if you look at the legacy of the Biden regime, it's cover up after cover up [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1648.8799999999999s)]
*  after cover up. And I'm so glad that Anthony Blinken is very adamant that Joe Biden had [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1653.6799999999998s)]
*  a really good sense of geopolitics. I really disagree with that. I think that's just a [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1658.48s)]
*  continuation of this cover up. I think you should have been asking Anthony Blinken, who was actually [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1663.8400000000001s)]
*  running the show. And it's really quite interesting. You think he had such a great geopolitical track [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1668.88s)]
*  record. I think the 13 families of the people in Afghanistan who died because of Joe Biden's botched [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1673.8400000000001s)]
*  withdrawal would certainly beg to differ with you on that. Maybe he just needed some more adrenaline, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1680.8000000000002s)]
*  but that's an absolutely asinine take. The guy was obviously sick from day one while he was in [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1684.88s)]
*  office. And no offense, if they were going to lie about the mental health and the actual health of [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1690.88s)]
*  the president so much so that even when he said on stage admitting to having cancer in 2022, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1696.0s)]
*  they continued to cover it up. They called it a gaffe. The media ran cover for him. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1701.7600000000002s)]
*  If they were willing to cover for something that huge, what else were they lying about? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1705.6000000000001s)]
*  So I don't take Anthony Blinken's word for one second that Joe Biden had a good sense of self [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1710.88s)]
*  when he was making decisions if he was willing to sit there as Secretary of State and say absolutely [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1715.92s)]
*  nothing for four years when Joe Biden was covering up one truly one of the largest, I would say, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1721.5200000000002s)]
*  health scandals bigger than Watergate of our time. Scott Horton, you know, like I said, I didn't book [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1725.7600000000002s)]
*  you to talk about the health of the ex-president. However, it is a massive story and it goes to the [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1732.24s)]
*  heart of, I guess, transparency of the president of the United States and how important that is to [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1739.84s)]
*  both American people to the rest of the world, frankly, that there is an honesty at the heart of [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1745.1999999999998s)]
*  how a president's health is relayed to the nation and to the wider world. What do you think we're [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1750.24s)]
*  dealing with here? I mean, with Biden, does it stretch credulity that out of nowhere he suddenly [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1756.56s)]
*  got this very late stage aggressive prostate cancer that's metastasized to his bones? Or should [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1762.8799999999999s)]
*  we take it at face value? Well, I don't take anything they say at face value, but I wouldn't [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1769.28s)]
*  want to speculate about, you know, the progress of his cancer or who knew what when or anything like [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1776.0s)]
*  that. I would add in agreement with the previous speaker there that I too am shocked that Antony [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1780.96s)]
*  Blinken, the Secretary of State, agrees with the decisions that he convinced Joe Biden to go along [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1787.84s)]
*  with for four years. I don't know how that's supposed to be like a big, you know, authoritative [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1793.2s)]
*  confirmation of his greatness. Also, Mr. Rubin speaks as though when Joe Biden took office, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1799.3600000000001s)]
*  the absolute catastrophe in Gaza and Ukraine were already going on and then he stood up to the bad [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1806.96s)]
*  guys. But of course, both of these catastrophes took place on his watch. Ukraine happened after a [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1813.1200000000001s)]
*  year of his complete failed diplomacy where he did not achieve an end to the Civil War in the East. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1819.04s)]
*  His own men, Derek Chalot from the State Department, admitted that they absolutely [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1826.3999999999999s)]
*  refused to discuss NATO membership for Ukraine with the Russians in any context whatsoever. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1830.8799999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden promised, yeah, we will have talks over missiles and we'll make a deal where we sign and [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1836.32s)]
*  promise not to put missiles in our keep. But then they refused to hold those conversations whatsoever. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1842.72s)]
*  They never followed up on that at all. And then they continued to just make threats. No, we promise [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1847.2s)]
*  we absolutely will bring Ukraine into NATO one day. We promise we will build up their military [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1853.2s)]
*  force. And as the CIA even told Yahoo News' Zach Dorfman, they were recommending to Biden, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1859.1200000000001s)]
*  or at least the agents in Ukraine were recommending to their bosses to recommend to Biden, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1867.92s)]
*  to cool it with the arms shipments because you're not deterring them. You're provoking them [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1873.12s)]
*  into action, making them feel like they better do it now, not later. Yeah, you scoff at the CIA [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1878.56s)]
*  officers on the ground whose words actually proved completely prophetic and were fulfilled [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1884.32s)]
*  within weeks of them saying so. And meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1890.48s)]
*  The New York Times ran a big exit piece on Antony Blinken. They called him the Secretary of War [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1895.92s)]
*  based on interviews of him. And they talked about how after Ukraine's biggest success in September [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1903.12s)]
*  of 22, the US military was recommending that we go to the table now while the Ukrainians are only [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1909.12s)]
*  this far behind and it doesn't get too much worse. And it was Antony Blinken and the State Department [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1916.3999999999999s)]
*  weenies like Mr. Rubin who overruled General Milley and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1922.48s)]
*  and their advice to wrap up the war. And now hundreds of thousands of people names. This is [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1928.4s)]
*  not a serious show. I thought I was on a serious program. You're on a serious program and you can [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1933.76s)]
*  respond to it. You don't call each other weenies on a serious program. Okay, so let me answer [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1940.0800000000002s)]
*  that's what the military man called the State Department guys. That's a well-known term for [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1945.8400000000001s)]
*  the State Department. You call me that and it's very juvenile. So let me respond to your substance, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1951.0400000000002s)]
*  which is the part that's interesting. Your basic point is that Ukraine should have been disarmed [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1956.24s)]
*  in advance of Putin's threats and by us giving them weapons, the few weapons they needed to defend [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1963.2s)]
*  themselves against Putin's invasion, we provoked the invasion. It's NATO expansion provoking the [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1969.04s)]
*  invasion. It's the United States diplomacy provoking the invasion. Nobody ever seems to blame the person [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1974.08s)]
*  who decided to invade his neighbor who made a decision to invade his neighbor and used [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1982.32s)]
*  hundreds and thousands of troops to invade their neighbor. And your idea that because we sent a [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1987.6799999999998s)]
*  few weapons over, we provoked him is the ultimate in appeasement. What you want to do in a situation [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1993.28s)]
*  like this is hopefully give your ally a chance to defend itself. And without minimal weapons that [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=1999.36s)]
*  he got both from Trump and from Biden, I don't think the Ukrainians would have been able to held [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2005.6s)]
*  off this Russian offensive and there's not a magic solution. And that's a dream. Oh, vision. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2011.04s)]
*  It wouldn't have happened. Putin decided to go to war and we had to confront that and we were able [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2017.52s)]
*  to confront it and we gathered the world together to confront it. Unfortunately, the current president [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2023.28s)]
*  has a different approach and maybe he'll get a deal and that'll be wonderful. But I don't think [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2029.2s)]
*  so. I think the Vladimir Putin has made a decision to run a war economy and the idea that we provoked [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2033.68s)]
*  Putin into invading Ukraine is an absurdity. This is a man who made a decision to invade his neighbor [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2040.56s)]
*  with hundreds of thousands of troops. He wasn't provoked into it. There was no threat. He made a [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2047.28s)]
*  decision to invade his neighbor and we should just confront that and figure out how to respond [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2054.96s)]
*  instead of coming up with loony ideas, loony, not weenie, loony ideas for why this war started. It [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2059.7599999999998s)]
*  started because Vladimir Putin invaded his neighbor. Well, just to be clear, James, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2066.8s)]
*  here's very quickly. Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, just to be clear. When you throw [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2071.52s)]
*  around the word like loony, James, I have to remind you we are a serious program, so please, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2076.48s)]
*  please, please don't use that. Weenies and loonies, they're in the same category. Let me bring in, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2080.88s)]
*  let me bring in Doran just quickly because you've written this book, When the Stones Speak. You're [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2086.8s)]
*  an IDF reservist. I got very angry over the last three or four days about what I've been [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2092.88s)]
*  seeing happening in Israel. I'll tell you why. Not because I don't think Israel had an absolute [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2101.36s)]
*  right and duty to defend itself after October the 7th. Of course they did. 3,000 terrorists [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2106.1600000000003s)]
*  poured over their border in three waves, murdering 1,200 people, kidnapping 255 or whatever it was, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2112.32s)]
*  including grandmothers, babies, the butchery, the barbarism. All of it was so heinous, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2120.64s)]
*  7,000 more wounded. This was a scale of terror attack we have rarely seen in modern times. Of [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2126.72s)]
*  course Israel had to respond. Of course it was going to respond with force. Hamas knew that. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2132.4s)]
*  Everybody knew that. And the question I kept asking for the first few weeks and months was, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2137.2s)]
*  well, what is a proportionate response? I didn't know the answer. I genuinely did not know the [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2142.08s)]
*  answer to what was a proportionate response. But what I feel now is that whatever the answer, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2147.44s)]
*  this has gone way beyond a proportionate response and that there are clearly people in the Netanyahu [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2154.2400000000002s)]
*  government, perhaps including him, who just want to just keep pounding away here because they don't [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2160.08s)]
*  really have any plan for what happens when they stop pounding. In Netanyahu's case, he faces [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2166.16s)]
*  corruption trials when he comes out of this war, which is no incentive to end a war by any yardstick. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2172.08s)]
*  But more importantly, it's clear from all the intelligence the Americans have been receiving [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2179.36s)]
*  and all the reports we've been seeing, there's no real evidence that Hamas has been neutralised [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2183.6s)]
*  at all with this relentless bombardment. We've now had six times the tonnage of bombs that you saw in [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2188.88s)]
*  Nagasaki and Hiroshima combined on a space which is, I think, a third of the size of those two cities. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2196.56s)]
*  And where have we got? We've got to a place where Hamas clearly still are there. They're clearly [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2203.7599999999998s)]
*  still holding these hostages and Israel can't get them to release them, which suggests to me that [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2210.96s)]
*  Hamas's power base is still pretty much intact or that process would have happened by now. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2216.24s)]
*  And I don't see any endgame or plan here. Other than increasingly it seems that there are people [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2222.0s)]
*  on that government who just want to get rid of all the Palestinians, who want to just take over Gaza, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2227.44s)]
*  and that will be it. And that is actually the very genocide that so many on the pro-Israeli side [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2232.32s)]
*  keep recoiling at hearing that word because they say it's not genocide. Well, if you get rid of a [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2238.96s)]
*  whole people based on their ethnicity from an expansive land that is theirs, where they've been [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2243.44s)]
*  living, what else do you call it? So I got angry and then everyone got angry at me because everyone [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2250.16s)]
*  gets angry about everything you ever say about this war. But from where you sit, are you comfortable? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2255.6s)]
*  Are you comfortable as an IDF reservist with what is now going on with hundreds being killed [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2261.52s)]
*  every day, so many women, so many children in particular, are you comfortable that there is a [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2267.44s)]
*  strategy here that is either working or is not just turning Israel slowly but surely into a global [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2273.3599999999997s)]
*  pariah? Pierce, I don't think that anyone in Israel has been comfortable since October 7th. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2279.92s)]
*  You're asking me what is a proportional response to 1200 people being slaughtered, raped, babies [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2288.48s)]
*  being burnt, 250 people which have been taken captive as hostages, 57 of which are still in [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2295.36s)]
*  the Gaza tunnels. I'll tell you, I think that the word is a smokescreen. Hamas went after civilians [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2301.92s)]
*  and you're asking me what's a proportional response? Israel's response has been never to go [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2307.68s)]
*  after a civilian, only to go after Hamas terrorists. Now I've been in Gaza, I've been in Gaza four [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2311.7599999999998s)]
*  different times since October 7th. They've killed tens of thousands of civilians. When you're in Gaza, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2317.2s)]
*  you're on the ground in Gaza, what you see, just one second, what you see when you're on Gaza [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2322.24s)]
*  is you're being fired on from parks, from schools, from apartment buildings. Hamas fighters are [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2327.52s)]
*  popping out of ground every Hamas tunnel. I don't know if you've been on Gaza, Pierce? No, you know [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2333.2s)]
*  why I haven't been in Gaza? Doran, Doran, Doran, hang on, hang on, you ask a question. You can go [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2337.28s)]
*  into Gaza, Pierce, you've been over a million people that have entered Gaza to visit Gaza. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2342.0s)]
*  Here's the key point, Doran, international journalists have not been allowed into Gaza to [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2345.44s)]
*  independently verify any of this. That's been another massive problem I've had with this. If [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2349.92s)]
*  Israel has nothing to hide, they should let all the... Pierce, have you ever been in Gaza? Hang on, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2355.28s)]
*  let me finish. Pierce. Hang on, let me finish my question. You made a career talking about Gaza. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2359.0400000000004s)]
*  Have you ever, you had 20 years to go to Gaza. Let me finish my question, please. What happened on [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2363.52s)]
*  October 7th? All of a sudden you want to walk into a war zone and have Israel... Doran, I'm going to [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2367.7599999999998s)]
*  finish my question, whether you let me or not, okay? And my question is this, if Israel has nothing [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2370.96s)]
*  to hide, why are they not letting international journalists go in? Tell me. Why don't they let [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2376.56s)]
*  them all in so that what you're telling us can actually be independently verified? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2383.28s)]
*  Pierce, Israel is trying to deal with a terrorist regime that is popping out of tunnels, popping out [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2388.0s)]
*  of buildings, is everywhere, and you want us to unleash a flood of reporters into the area. When [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2394.08s)]
*  a Hamas reporter was killed because he was Hamas, the entire world media blamed Israel for killing [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2399.28s)]
*  a reporter, and he was a member of Hamas, a verified member of Hamas that filmed himself as part of [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2405.52s)]
*  October 7th. So you want us to unleash a thousand reporters. You're not binding the international [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2410.96s)]
*  media out of concern for their safety. One second, Pierce. One second. You said a lot of different [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2414.24s)]
*  things here. You asked me about a... Don't insult my intelligence. You're asking me questions while [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2418.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm speaking. Don't insult my intelligence. Israel is not banning international media out of concern [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2422.08s)]
*  for our safety. I'm just trying to provide an answer, Pierce. I don't feel like I have an [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2427.04s)]
*  opportunity to actually answer you. You're not banning us out of concern for our safety. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2428.56s)]
*  You're banning us because you don't want the international media to witness what you're doing [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2431.6s)]
*  on the ground for reasons that I don't know. But the best way to remove any suspicion about [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2435.8399999999997s)]
*  what you're doing is to let the international media in. They will make their own risk assessment. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2441.2799999999997s)]
*  It will be down to their security teams, as it is in any war zone. But the idea that somehow [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2445.2799999999997s)]
*  Gaza should be the only war zone in the world where you don't let international journalists go and [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2450.4s)]
*  operate and do their job, and you can do that, Israel, because you basically control all the [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2454.96s)]
*  access to Gaza, I'm afraid is for the birds. You should just let the media in. Then everything [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2460.16s)]
*  you're saying can be verified as true or false. And then you can just let the media in. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2465.52s)]
*  Or untrue. And the fact that Israel won't allow it is sticking in my gullet. And when it's [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2471.04s)]
*  pretended to be out of some quaint concern for my personal safety, I'm afraid it's laughable. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2477.12s)]
*  Yeah, and you've killed more journalists than all other conflicts combined on earth. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2485.2799999999997s)]
*  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times. I myself have taken reporters into Gaza, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2488.88s)]
*  in armored vehicles, let them walk around. Palestinians in Gaza take pictures with their [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2494.72s)]
*  phones every single day. All you have to do is look at Telegram, look at Excel, get every single [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2499.28s)]
*  social media channel. If you think that the suffering of Gazans is not displayed, you're [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2503.6000000000004s)]
*  wrong. What is not being presented, and this lies at the very source of your question, is why is [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2508.0s)]
*  there so much suffering in Gaza? We have brought 1.8 million tons of food into Gaza. That is a ton [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2512.96s)]
*  of food, 2,000 pounds of food per person in Gaza. Why are there people in Gaza that are hungry right [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2520.96s)]
*  now? It's because all that food that goes into Gaza is taken by UNRWA, all the international [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2527.76s)]
*  agencies that fill their coffers with that food, by Hamas, who steals that food from the [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2533.0400000000004s)]
*  Gazan people. And now that Israel actually has a plan to go into Gaza, take over the Gaza Strip, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2537.2000000000003s)]
*  enable very clear distribution points, you should be cheering, Pierce. Everyone in this panel should [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2543.28s)]
*  be cheering. I don't cheer in 11-week blockade of food to an impoverished people. Should destroy Hamas [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2548.96s)]
*  and should be able to bring the food to the people who need it. But instead, what you are doing, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2554.08s)]
*  and what Cenk is doing, is you are perpetuating the rule of Hamas. You're starving them, you sicko. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2558.88s)]
*  Did you not see, did you not see Odeh Rabi? Do you know who that is, Cenk? Cenk, who's Odeh Rabi? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2563.12s)]
*  Do you know Odeh Rabi? Did you speak about Odeh Rabi, Cenk? I didn't see him on your social media. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2569.2s)]
*  Listen, here's what I'm saying about the fact that your government is starving 2.2 million people [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2575.52s)]

*  10,000 people came to his funeral when his body was dragged through the streets of Gaza. His parents [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2586.2400000000002s)]
*  received his body with a noose around his neck and his underwear. You're sick. You're deranged. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2592.56s)]
*  And all those people, 5 more killed and dozens and dozens of them have gone missing. You know who's [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2597.12s)]
*  the worst terrorist in the world? Netanyahu. But you would decide to keep Hamas in power. And the reason is, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2602.64s)]
*  you've never been on the ground. You support David Duke. You're an anti-Semite at your core. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2608.08s)]
*  You care nothing else about the world. You don't care about women. You call blacks by the N-word. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2613.52s)]
*  If you're going to talk over everyone else, I'm going to talk over you. You've starved more people [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2617.6800000000003s)]
*  than anyone else in the world. Israel has killed more journalists than anyone else in the world. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2622.2400000000002s)]
*  You're not going to talk over me. You've got these people that are starving. Hamas did not make that [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2627.76s)]
*  decision. Hamas is terrible. Israel made that decision. But whenever you start talking about [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2632.56s)]
*  Israel, guys like this come on shows and never stop talking about the same thing. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2637.6s)]
*  But don't talk over each other because no one can hear it. Israeli propaganda, and I'm sick of it. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2640.88s)]
*  Get him to shut up for a second and let other people talk. All they do is Israeli propaganda. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2645.52s)]
*  It is a fact that they are starving the children of Gaza right now. It is a fact that they have [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2651.52s)]
*  killed over 53,000 people. And he says, oh, 1,200 is terrible. It is terrible what Hamas did on [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2656.24s)]
*  October 7th. But to say that 1,200 people killed and 36 children killed is terrible. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2662.56s)]
*  Since the very day you've been against the government propagating the bombs that Israel needs to fight [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2666.9599999999996s)]
*  its wars, you sit and scream that 12,000 babies and children killed is not terrible. If it was up to [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2672.0s)]
*  you, you'd be leaving the Gaza people under the regime of Hamas. You are the enemy. You are the [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2678.3199999999997s)]
*  Gaza people. You are the enemy of America. You are the enemy of America. Okay. You got to fight Iraq. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2685.12s)]
*  You call yourself a young Turk. You've taken 300 million dollars. You starve children to death. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2691.28s)]
*  You are the worst terrorist of my lifetime. You led 1 million Armenians into the Syrian desert. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2697.12s)]
*  I recognize the Armenian genocide. In fact, Armenian genocide, you want to get personal. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2702.8s)]
*  You know the Armenian genocide is exactly what Israel is doing to the Palestinians now. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2706.2400000000002s)]
*  David Duke is the pro-American. I get it, Jamie. David Duke is the American. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2711.12s)]
*  Israel is the largest terrorist organization in the world right now. All right. All right. That's [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2715.04s)]
*  enough. That's enough. All right, listen. When you both shout, no one can hear a word. Natalie. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2720.08s)]
*  I know. That's why he does it, Piers. Okay. You gave as good as you got. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2726.4s)]
*  Whatsoever, Jamie. Jamie has left us. I'm not quite sure. Maybe his ear drums [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2732.7999999999997s)]
*  burst. Natalie, let me just ask you about Israel and what is happening here. Because it seems to me [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2740.96s)]
*  whatever side of the fence you've been on on this, there's got to be a moment of reckoning here. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2747.36s)]
*  I read a very good column by Matthew Said in the Sunday Times here in London yesterday in which he [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2753.12s)]
*  just said, look, it's time for Israelis and Jewish people everywhere to look at themselves on this and [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2758.88s)]
*  say, what is happening here? Is Israel actually winning any war here? Is it making more enemies [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2764.96s)]
*  by the day with this constant slaughter of so many civilians on the ground? Does Netanyahu have had [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2772.2400000000002s)]
*  any incentive because of all the legal issues he faces to end this? Does he have control over [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2779.04s)]
*  his government? We know he did a dirty deal to get back into power with some real right-wing [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2784.0s)]
*  headbangers who clearly speak in genocidal language, suggesting their motivation is indeed [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2789.2s)]
*  a form of genocide there. But I just don't see what the end game is here. I don't understand [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2796.3199999999997s)]
*  how this ends without just constant, constant more loss of life, particularly civilian life. Do you? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2801.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's led to a fatigue, but you sort of see that shift in rhetoric coming [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2810.24s)]
*  from President Trump, I think particularly on his most recent trip or even the deals, right? Lifting [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2814.24s)]
*  sanctions on Syria, talking about what's been going on in Gaza, using rhetoric and diction. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2818.96s)]
*  That is something that's not necessarily typical, especially for Republicans, but for just most [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2824.4s)]
*  American presidents. And I think you even see it reflected in the shifting of opinion polling, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2829.36s)]
*  particularly among younger Americans. It really seems to be only sort of the holdout, maybe more [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2833.92s)]
*  boomer GOP types that are still steadfastly in support of Israel. And the intricacies of that [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2838.16s)]
*  region aside, like you always say, it's a lose-lose. I think what it is, is it's a fundamental [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2844.0s)]
*  reorientation of priorities. And I think the MAGA movement, right, the people who would rather be [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2848.8s)]
*  talking about the big, beautiful bill, Medicaid stuff that directs them and PACLI, I'm not being [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2854.0s)]
*  negligent to human rights issues going on, but I think that one of the core tenets of the MAGA [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2858.64s)]
*  movement is really looking at these events as to how they impact the United States. So the idea [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2862.88s)]
*  that one would be pro-Israel or anti-Israel is too reductive. And frankly, that's a paradigm that I [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2868.56s)]
*  don't even necessarily buy into because I'm pro-America and I would put America first and I [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2873.92s)]
*  don't want to see massive floods of refugees into, frankly, anywhere in the Middle East, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2878.32s)]
*  let alone the West, certainly not the United States. And I think that you're just creating [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2882.48s)]
*  the potential for that. I'm glad we have President Trump in office to prevent that. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2886.56s)]
*  I am not for sending foreign aid really anywhere. I don't think we should be arming [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2890.0s)]
*  Israel to the level that we are, which is maybe heresy or heretical for being a supporter of [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2895.04s)]
*  President Trump and a Republican. But on the other hand, Hamas is a terrorist state and Israel has [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2899.7599999999998s)]
*  the right to defend itself. I just don't think that the United States should necessarily be [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2904.24s)]
*  supporting them at the rate that we do. Right. I mean, Scott Horton, the backdrop to all this, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2908.08s)]
*  we've just seen... Zero. They should get zero. I'll come to you, Cheyenne, Scott. The [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2911.7599999999998s)]
*  Trump trip to the Middle East, I was in Qatar for that state dinner and what was palpable [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2917.2799999999997s)]
*  was how popular Trump is in the Middle East now, whether he was in Saudi Arabia making a [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2922.08s)]
*  pretty transformative speech about it's time for the neocons in the West to get their big noses [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2927.6s)]
*  and their bombs out of the Middle East and let Middle East countries do what they've been doing [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2933.52s)]
*  very successfully, which is building up massive national brands now, whether it's Saudi Arabia, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2938.88s)]
*  Qatar, the UAE, whatever. You get a sense of a very dynamic, very fast evolving society in all [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2944.96s)]
*  of these countries, albeit from a pretty low base, just to be clear, but not a low base they [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2951.04s)]
*  try and deny. Certainly they didn't when I spoke to them about it. But Trump, very popular there. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2957.2799999999997s)]
*  And at the same time, a report coming out that Hamas launched this attack on October the 7th, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2963.12s)]
*  ostensibly because the Hamas leadership wanted to thwart and to stop any normalisation of relations [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2967.6s)]
*  between Saudi Arabia and Israel. They didn't want them being added to the Abraham Accords. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2974.24s)]
*  That seems completely plausible to me that that was why they did this, with the [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2980.1600000000003s)]
*  obvious tacit, behind the scenes support of Iran. But it seems to have had the opposite effect, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2986.6400000000003s)]
*  I would argue. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2992.0s)]
*  Pierce, can I respond to that? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2992.48s)]
*  No, in a moment, yeah. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2993.1200000000003s)]
*  Can I respond to that, Pierce? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2994.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm asking Scott first. I'm asking Scott first. It seems to me that Saudi Arabia's been very [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=2995.1200000000003s)]
*  pragmatic and that they would like to ultimately join the Abraham Accords, I believe. And that is [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3000.6400000000003s)]
*  why I think that this will have to be sorted, the situation in Gaza, probably driven by pressure [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3007.6s)]
*  from Trump and a coalition of Middle Eastern countries to get this stopped. Because without [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3012.64s)]
*  the war being stopped, there can be no addition of Saudi Arabia to the Abraham Accords. Am I mad, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3018.08s)]
*  or do you think what's going on here? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3024.4s)]
*  Well, I mean, yes. Up until recent times, it went without saying, it was widely understood [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3028.4s)]
*  that none of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries would normalize [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3035.6s)]
*  relations with Israel until the Palestinians got a deal. And the Abraham Accords were the invention [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3039.8399999999997s)]
*  of Netanyahu and Jared Kushner the last time Trump was president. And the idea was the American [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3045.7599999999998s)]
*  people will pony up the money to get these states to go ahead and forsake the Palestinians and [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3051.7599999999998s)]
*  normalize with Israel anyway. So Bahrain got F-16s, UAE got F-35s, Sudan got debt forgiveness, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3056.96s)]
*  and Morocco got American recognition of their seizure of the northern half of Western Sahara. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3066.4s)]
*  And this was their bribes, their payoffs to go ahead and normalize with Israel. And quite frankly, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3072.32s)]
*  October 7th represents the complete failure of that Netanyahu doctrine. You might remember [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3077.92s)]
*  that just three weeks before the attack, Netanyahu gave a speech at the United Nations, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3083.36s)]
*  and he always has a good visual aid, cartoon bomb or something. In this case, it was his map of the [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3089.44s)]
*  new Middle East. And he was mocking Shimon Peres, who had used this phrase in the attempted [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3095.2000000000003s)]
*  continuity from the Rabin doctrine, which was to make peace with the Palestinians and the Arab [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3103.36s)]
*  neighbors and turn against the peripheral states like Iran. And he was saying, ha, see, I got away [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3108.56s)]
*  with making the new Middle East without giving anything to the Palestinians. And to paraphrase [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3114.32s)]
*  him pretty tightly, he says to the Palestinians in the speech, no one's coming for you. I got it. No [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3119.68s)]
*  citizenship for you and no independence for you. And I get to go ahead and have the whole Middle [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3126.4s)]
*  East, the whole, all the Arab Sunni states in my corner anyway, you have been forsaken. Ha ha ha. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3132.08s)]
*  And then it was three weeks later that they broke out of their pen and launched the October 7th [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3139.6s)]
*  attack in order to exactly as you say, Piers, to try to at least make, again, make the issue [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3144.3199999999997s)]
*  controversial enough that it would prevent Saudi Arabia from signing on to the deal and forsaking [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3151.36s)]
*  their previous position of mandating or, you know, insisting on a Palestinian state first. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3157.12s)]
*  So that means then if Trump and it's in the New York Times today, Trump himself says the Palestinians [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3162.48s)]
*  are starving under, it's been an 11 week full blockade since the last time they let any aid in [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3167.8399999999997s)]
*  little babies. It's on the front page of anti war.com today. Babies are literally starving to death [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3176.4s)]
*  there daily now, along with the bombing campaign. If Trump wants a new Middle East where everybody [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3181.84s)]
*  can get along and trade and be prosperous at peace, he has to pick up the phone and tell Netanyahu to [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3188.32s)]
*  stop this right now and Piers Morgan, that is all it would take. Yeah. And, you know, he's edging. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3195.28s)]
*  I would say he's edging closer just as I think he's edging closer to running out of patience [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3201.04s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin. Dohran, you wanted to come in here? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3205.84s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, I think first of all, if we want to save the babies of Gaza, which we do, the first [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3208.56s)]

*  they supporting Israel? We should pull out. Do we really want to leave 1.8 million people [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3220.4s)]
*  under the rule of a tyrannic terrorist regime that took dozens of billions of dollars paid for by [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3225.2799999999997s)]
*  U.S. taxpayers, by British taxpayers in terms of building tunnels? Let me just finish please. I'll [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3232.08s)]
*  let you, one second, let me just finish. I can, please. Building tunnels, building a terror network [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3238.16s)]
*  to say that they came and attacked Israel because the Abraham Accords, all one has to do is open up [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3242.8799999999997s)]
*  the 1988 Hamas charter in which it calls Israelis, Nazis. It says every tree will call out there's a [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3247.68s)]
*  Jew behind me, come and kill the Jews. It talks incessantly about how the Jews started World War [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3255.68s)]
*  I, started World War II. One month before October 7th, by the way, you had Mahmoud Abbas, and I'm [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3260.96s)]
*  reading right now on page 14, that says they say Hitler killed the Jews. This is my new book, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3266.16s)]
*  and the Europe hated the Jews because they were Jews. Not true. It was clearly explained they [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3271.2799999999997s)]
*  fought the Jews because of their money lending. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian authority head, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3276.96s)]
*  is creating, propagating. There was no Holocaust. There's no Jewish Christian history in Israel. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3283.6s)]
*  They erased the people, and that is why they attacked on October 7th. They need no reason, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3289.7599999999998s)]
*  which is why they launched 30,000 rockets at Israel before October 7th and engaged in [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3294.0s)]
*  multi-border attacks before October 7th. To say that this is because the Abraham Accord is to simply [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3299.04s)]
*  try to cover the rest of the most brutal terror regimes in the world. Let me ask you a question. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3304.96s)]
*  This is the world that needs to be called out. Doron, on October 7th, how many members of Hamas were there? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3309.92s)]
*  About 25,000. Okay, so you've had what? You've had nearly 20 months [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3318.48s)]
*  one of the, well, the most superior military force in the whole Middle East. You've had 20 months. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3324.0s)]
*  You've rained down bombs which are three, five, I think it's five, I can't remember the exact statistic, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3330.08s)]
*  multiple times the tonnage of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You've rained it down on an area much smaller [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3335.92s)]
*  than those two cities combined, and yet you still haven't eliminated Hamas. You don't seem to be any [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3343.92s)]
*  nearer eliminating them because you still can't get the hostages back. At some point you have to [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3349.92s)]
*  admit, though, that you cannot do this. This strategy is simply not working. All you're doing [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3355.6s)]
*  is killing more and more civilians. Where is the victory? You have failed. The most superior fighting [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3362.08s)]
*  force in the Middle East has failed to take out a rag-bag collection of 25,000 terrorists. How? How [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3368.48s)]
*  have you failed so badly? You failed by letting them into Israel on October the 7th, and you [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3375.68s)]
*  failed to eliminate them now. And in fact all the intelligence suggests that for every one that you [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3381.04s)]
*  have killed in Hamas they've been replaced by five more. That's what I read at the weekend. Now, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3385.12s)]
*  maybe that's wrong, maybe that's poor information. The entire command structure, including this [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3390.3999999999996s)]
*  last week, of Hamas has been destroyed. Hamas right now is operating as individual units and hiding [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3398.3999999999996s)]
*  behind civilians in Gaza, hiding behind the hostages. If we place as a goal, we haven't [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3403.6s)]
*  destroyed Hamas because we haven't gotten our hostages back, the reason we haven't destroyed [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3409.04s)]
*  Hamas are two. First of all, they're hiding behind our hostages and most of us don't want to just [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3412.56s)]
*  blow right through our hostages to kill them. That is the most cynical use of a terror group. They took [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3417.44s)]
*  250 people, raped and killed and executed them in order to tell the idea of to keep away. The other [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3421.8399999999997s)]
*  reason why this didn't finish so quickly, Pierce, is the root of this conversation. We are trying to [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3428.24s)]
*  give food to the people of Gaza. No foreign army in the history of the world has taken care of an [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3432.64s)]
*  enemy population. The degree to which Israel is taking care of, I was there on the humanitarian, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3438.96s)]
*  I was there on the ground. When was the last time you were there? It's been 11 weeks, a full week. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3444.8799999999997s)]
*  Cenk, when were you in Gaza? I haven't been there since they made me. Cenk, when were you in Gaza? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3449.3599999999997s)]
*  Scott, when were you in Gaza? I haven't been there. When were you there? It's been 11 weeks. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3452.72s)]
*  When were you there? I was there. I was there following October 7th on the ground at the [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3456.16s)]
*  humanitarian corridor helping Gazans reach the humanitarian Hamas. We are being fired on by [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3461.44s)]
*  Hamas. The reason why we haven't destroyed them is we are giving food to these people and we all know [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3469.2000000000003s)]
*  that 50% of that food goes to Hamas. They recruit the new fighters and therefore the new plan is, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3473.76s)]
*  Pierce, let me just finish for one second. The new plan is to go into Gaza, take over all of Gaza [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3479.28s)]
*  and enable food centers and then destroy Hamas. Again, I will say this is the only thing that [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3485.36s)]
*  provides a long-term benefit for Israelis and the people in Gaza that are living under this [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3490.96s)]
*  tyrannical regime. Let us destroy them. Do not make any excuses. All right, Cenk, your final word. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3496.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay, all right. So first of all, this guy does nothing but propaganda, almost everything he said [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3504.56s)]
*  was a lie. They're not there to help the Gazans. Does anyone on planet earth believe this preposterous [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3510.4s)]
*  liar that the Israelis are trying to help the people of Gaza? And he said there's 25,000 people [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3516.16s)]
*  in Hamas before the war started. So there's 2.2 million people in Gaza overall. All their homes have [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3521.68s)]
*  been destroyed, all their hospitals, all their schools. Everything has been razed and destroyed [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3528.56s)]
*  by Israel. That is not helping them. That is butchering them. They've killed over 53,000 people [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3533.7599999999998s)]
*  at a bare minimum, injured over 120,000. They've been starving them for 74 days. They finally decide [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3538.7999999999997s)]
*  to let some food in now because of what Netanyahu called optics. They were losing the PR war because [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3545.2s)]
*  people were literally seeing babies starve to death. The moms had run out of breast milk because [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3550.56s)]
*  of malnutrition and there's obviously no baby food because Israel, the monstrous terrorist state of [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3555.4399999999996s)]
*  Israel, did not allow any food in. But there are good people in Israel and there are good [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3560.64s)]
*  supporters of Israel that normally like Israel. And by the way, I don't hate Israel normally. I [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3566.24s)]
*  want it to be a safe haven, but I don't want it to murder and occupy and oppress the Palestinians [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3570.8s)]
*  for the rest of the time. Yeah, does David Duke want Israel to be a safe haven? And he just... [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3576.48s)]
*  Where have you been with these protesters on campus? Okay, here we go. This guy, of course... [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3578.88s)]
*  You like Israel. So, Piers, you get the strategy they do on your show where they won't let the [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3581.2000000000003s)]
*  other side talk. You support Hamas right now. You are defending Hamas. Yes, I'm sorry. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3585.6000000000004s)]
*  You need to... Doran, can you let... Doran, we let you speak. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3589.28s)]
*  Doran, you're allowed to make your comments. Let's check. Just finish here, please. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3592.88s)]
*  Okay, so if you actually care about Israel, you would not enable their worst instincts. Rabbi [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3596.88s)]
*  Kareem went... He's a member of Knesset and he did a speech where he said, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3605.52s)]
*  it is not in Jewish tradition that we starve babies. And if you think it is, you're insulting [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3609.36s)]
*  Jewish tradition more than the worst enemy of Israel. And the rabbi is right. Rabbi Jacobs [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3614.1600000000003s)]
*  here in America said, what are we doing? For God's sake, let them eat. Look at the image that [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3619.12s)]
*  we're putting out there of Israel. Now, don't... And this guy comes in here with a long history [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3624.72s)]
*  lesson. Brother, we know that. And what happened to the Jews throughout history is terrible and [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3629.2s)]
*  should never happen again. But it should also never happen to the Palestinians or any other [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3634.0s)]
*  people again. And so, when you say, oh, well, back then this happened also, it's okay. How [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3638.56s)]
*  does that work? When we do it to Palestinians, it is not okay when you do it to Palestinians. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3643.52s)]
*  Again, here he goes again. Here he goes again. Look, brother, a lot of people are allowed to say [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3649.2799999999997s)]
*  never again, but not you. You're not allowed to say it because you're actively saying that you [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3654.08s)]
*  want to conquer the Palestinians. You want to starve the Palestinians and you've murdered [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3658.96s)]
*  enough of their children. For God's sake, let our people go. What is wrong with you? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3663.44s)]
*  Israel has become what it most feared and despised. It has become that and it breaks my heart. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3669.36s)]
*  It isn't just the Palestinians that are suffering. The people of Israel... Oh, I'm sure it does. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3675.44s)]
*  I'm sure it breaks your heart. I'm sure it does. I'm sure it does. I'm asking you, is this who you are? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3678.96s)]
*  You must be crying right now over Israel. Is this who you are? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3680.0s)]
*  Is this the kind of people you want to be that you starve babies to death and the whole world [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3683.92s)]
*  sees it with their own eyes? Why do you want the whole world to hate Israel? How does that help [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3689.28s)]
*  Israel? And it doesn't help any of my Jewish friends or family. So by destroying Hamas, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3695.2000000000003s)]
*  do not do it in their name. We've got to end it here. All I would say, Doron, you are not destroying [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3699.84s)]
*  Hamas. There's no evidence you're destroying Hamas. Every time they release a hostage... Of course [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3708.96s)]
*  we're destroying Hamas. Really? If we have the green light and continued aid that reached the [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3713.12s)]
*  people and now Hamas will disappear in three months. They're never going to kill enough [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3717.8399999999997s)]
*  Palestinians to satiate them. This has nothing to do with Hamas. I don't think this war strategy... [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3723.04s)]
*  You are a fear monger. There's two million people in charge of world war II. It's collective punishment. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3728.56s)]
*  It's collective punishment. There is no actual evidence you are defeating Hamas. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3732.56s)]
*  There is no evidence you are defeating Hamas and that is my problem with what is going on. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3738.24s)]
*  If there was clear evidence you were winning, great. There isn't. You cannot destroy the Nazis. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3743.44s)]
*  We would be saluting the Third Reich today if we listened to those people. You are trying to [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3748.16s)]
*  convince Israel in the world we can't destroy Hamas. Well you are wrong. You are doing the Third [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3751.8399999999997s)]
*  Reich. You are doing it. Not only about Israel. I can't stand this propaganda. You're the one [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3755.2s)]
*  starving babies. Don't call anyone else the Third Reich. Don't call anyone the Third Reich when you're starving babies to death. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3760.4s)]
*  Have you no humanity? Have you no morality? Have you no decency? Have you no decency? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3767.36s)]
*  You do not speak for Jewish people. You do not speak for all the people of Israel. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3773.76s)]
*  All right. I'm going to end it there. I'm going to end it there before blood vessels get burned [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3778.7200000000003s)]

*  I don't see what the end game is here. I don't see victory in the air for Israel. I see them [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3828.96s)]
*  eroding global support rapidly with what is now happening. How do you see it? I agree with you. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3835.6800000000003s)]
*  What Israel, what this Israeli government is doing is catastrophic. It is a genocide. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3843.6s)]
*  It's extraordinarily cruel. It's extraordinarily vulgar, vicious, ugly. It's disgusting beyond [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3850.96s)]
*  imagining. And the problem is a very basic one, Piers, which is that there are two peoples living [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3863.2s)]
*  in what used to be mandatory Palestine when Britain controlled Palestine after World War I. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3873.36s)]
*  There are the Arab Muslims and there are the Jews. And there need to be two states, one that is for [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3881.1200000000003s)]
*  the Jews and one that is for the Muslim Arabs. The problem is that Netanyahu and his ilk and a [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3891.04s)]
*  lot of the political elite class for decades has said, we will rule over everybody. There will [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3900.8s)]
*  never be a Palestinian state. There are many motivations for that view. One is perhaps Netanyahu's [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3911.84s)]
*  view, this is the only way we can be secure. The other, which is also very popular among parts of [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3921.1200000000003s)]
*  the Israeli government, is that God promised us everything. These other people are on our land. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3930.4s)]
*  Now, whatever you say about it, there is no end game of peace on the Netanyahu plan, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3938.8s)]
*  because the Netanyahu plan, and this has been for decades, is to rule over the entire land. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3947.76s)]
*  And that means ruling over the Palestinians either in an apartheid state, in other words, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3955.7599999999998s)]
*  oppressing the Palestinian people, or killing them, or expelling them in ethnic cleansing. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3962.32s)]
*  It's clear that all of those methods are deliberately being used now. This constant [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3970.8s)]
*  shouting, hamas, hamas, hamas, is not the point at all. The point is that the political end game [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3977.12s)]
*  for Netanyahu, Smotrich, Ben Gavir, the leaders of this government, is to rule over the entire [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3985.92s)]
*  territory of what was mandatory Palestine. In other words, for Israel to control everything. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=3994.24s)]
*  In fact, Netanyahu makes no bones about it. He doesn't hide anything. He says, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4002.16s)]
*  we will control Gaza. Well, what does that mean? It either means extraordinary oppression, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4008.08s)]
*  or it means ethnic cleansing, or it means mass murder. Now, Israel's committing mass murder [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4015.04s)]
*  right now. It is as simple as that. And Israel says, well, it's about hamas, but what is their [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4022.08s)]
*  end game that they offer? They don't offer an end game. They are very clear on the inside. I [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4027.84s)]
*  know what the end game is, because if you follow the Israeli politics, the end game is we control [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4036.08s)]
*  everything. In fact, some of this extremist coalition is so vulgarly, rabidly, violently [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4044.4s)]
*  extreme that their interpretation of, quote, God's promise to the Jewish people is parts of [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4055.92s)]
*  Egypt, parts of Syria, parts of Lebanon. They have a very expansive view. And indeed, Israel is in [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4064.8s)]
*  Syria now. It is in Lebanon now. And there are parts of this coalition that say, we're going to [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4073.6800000000003s)]
*  stay there. So the problem, Piers, is a political problem. You're completely right. It cannot be [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4079.44s)]
*  solved by war or defeating Hamas. That's not even their purpose. Their purpose is to control [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4088.16s)]
*  all the land. What they call Greater Israel, or Yisrael Hashlema, mean the big expanse of Israel. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4094.96s)]
*  It's a madness. It's a zealotry. It's a cruelty. It's nothing less than that. And there is no peace [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4106.160000000001s)]
*  possible until there is a state of Palestine living in peace on the internationally recognized [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4114.72s)]
*  borders, which are the borders of the 4th of June, 1967, alongside Israel. Netanyahu would never tell [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4124.240000000001s)]
*  you. What this Doron Spielman, who was shouting just a moment ago, would never tell you is that [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4134.08s)]
*  all of the Arab states have said, we will have peace when there is a state of Palestine. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4143.44s)]
*  What they won't tell you is that the entire 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4151.2s)]
*  has said, we will have peace with Israel when there is a state of Palestine as a UN member state, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4159.44s)]
*  properly constituted. And in fact, and you know I hang out at the United Nations, more than 180 [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4168.0s)]
*  countries of the world say this, with a population of more than 95% of the world population. There is [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4176.879999999999s)]
*  a madness, a sickness of the Israeli government, this extremist, cruel and zealot government. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4186.48s)]
*  But the tragic part is the United States and parts of Europe have backed up this vile behavior. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4197.44s)]
*  But I do think, we've got to move on to Ukraine. But I do think on that what's encouraging to me [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4207.36s)]
*  is that Trump didn't go and see Netanyahu on his trip to the Middle East. He was extremely friendly [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4212.88s)]
*  with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. He knows what the criteria is if there's ever to be [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4219.28s)]
*  normalization of relations with Saudi and Israel. And it is exactly as he articulated. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4224.72s)]
*  And so I agree with you completely. And all Trump has to say to bring peace, to win his Nobel Peace [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4229.76s)]
*  Prize, is that there will be a state of Palestine without Hamas demilitarized, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4236.4s)]
*  living safely next to Israel. It's possible. It's one thing and it works. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4244.08s)]
*  I think it might be edging nearer to that scenario than people think. Because I think Trump's patience [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4249.44s)]
*  is running out with Netanyahu. I think it's also running out pretty rapidly with Putin. They're [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4254.5599999999995s)]
*  talking actually, I think as we're talking now. And we'll get a read out of that just briefly, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4259.839999999999s)]
*  because we're running out of time. But just briefly, where do you think we are with Ukraine? [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4265.28s)]
*  Is Putin actually wanting to do a deal, do you think? Or is he, as some of the mood music [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4270.5599999999995s)]
*  around Russia suggests, is he just in this now for a limitless war economy? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4276.4s)]
*  No, not at all. Putin wants a deal. The deal was on the table on April 15, 2022, about to be signed [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4283.12s)]
*  when Boris Johnson and Joe Biden told Zelensky, don't sign. So there was a deal to be reached. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4292.400000000001s)]
*  It has three components. One is that Ukraine would be neutral, not a member of NATO. Second [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4299.2s)]
*  is that there would be a territorial settlement. I can come back to that. And third is that there [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4306.0s)]
*  would be security guarantees for Ukraine. Now, on each of these three points, not so much on the [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4311.76s)]
*  first, no NATO, this is fundamental. This was the ultimate cause of the war, the neocon push of NATO [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4318.48s)]
*  enlargement. But the other two issues are more controversial, of course, which land in which way, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4324.959999999999s)]
*  what kind of security arrangement. But those were nearly negotiated, by the way, three years ago, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4333.919999999999s)]
*  and the US and UK stopped it. Putin wants those three terms. Trump wants those three terms. We're [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4340.64s)]
*  not so far from a peace settlement, actually. No, I think you're right. Yeah, I think you're right. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4348.96s)]
*  Geoffrey, we've got to leave it there. I'm sorry. I've really enjoyed talking to you, as always. Thank [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOUMUyqLnY&t=4353.200000000001s)]
