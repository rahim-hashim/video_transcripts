Video Description: MAGA has maintained an understandably rosy view of Donald Trump’s second term so far, but surely there’s a limit to their dedication? Well, the first test may be here.

Trump won the 2024 election on the promise of ending wars and putting America first, but the 47th president is now claiming that a ceasefire in Palestine may mean ‘relocating’ Palestinian people or even sending US troops to the Gaza strip. Many of those in the pro-Palestine camp believe this was always Israel’s plan, and that Benjamin Netanyahu has manipulated Trump into working for Israel’s interests, not America’s.

So is Trump serious? Could US soldiers really end up keeping the peace in Gaza? Is moving the Palestinians out really the only option left? Piers Morgan puts all these questions up for debate, with host and founder of 'The Young Turks' Cenk Uygur, commentator and author Batya Ungar-Sargon, host of the 'Part of the Problem Podcast' Dave Smith and actor Dean Cain. Then, former Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi joins Piers in the studio for his take on the current situation.

# “BIBLICAL Levels Of Evil!” Trump Gaza Plan & Putin Peace Talks
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY)
*  If all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12 o'clock all hell is gonna break out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=0.0s)]
*  It's called the consequences of a war and a war that was started by Hamas on October 7th [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=8.1s)]
*  Donald Trump the other day said there's 1.9 million people in Gaza [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's 400,000 shy of what we started with. What are you guys gonna do start bombing the rubble? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=18.72s)]
*  This is biblical levels of evil when Israel does 60 times the terrorism of Hamas [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=24.3s)]
*  We should call them what they are a terrorist state and we should stop funding them [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=31.02s)]
*  It was always about the theft of Palestinian land [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=35.58s)]
*  What is your reaction to Donald Trump and his announcement about talking to Putin America's got all the chips here [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=46.42s)]
*  We can get Vladimir Putin to do much of what we would like him to do [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=52.34s)]
*  I think you could work out a deal where the US pulls out of NATO [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=56.82000000000001s)]
*  We did not do anything to prevent this totally preventable war [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=59.540000000000006s)]
*  This week has been dominated by cries of constitutional crisis in DC as President Trump fights the courts and emboldens Elon Musk [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  It's worth noting in response that US foreign policy has operated without [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=75.54s)]
*  Constitutional sanction for many decades and with far graver consequences now President Trump finds himself at the beating heart of a genuine crisis [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=79.58000000000001s)]
*  unfolding 5,000 miles away in Gaza Hamas says Israel has violated the terms of its ceasefire agreement and is suspending the release of hostages [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=87.62s)]
*  President Trump has given Netanyahu the green light to cancel the deal altogether if hostages are not returned as planned on Saturday [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=95.34s)]
*  I'm speaking for myself Israel can override it [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=103.10000000000001s)]
*  But from myself Saturday at 12 o'clock and if they're not [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=106.41999999999999s)]
*  They're not here all hell is gonna break out [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=111.69999999999999s)]
*  Well Arab states are still reeling from Trump's claim that Palestinians should be resettled in Egypt and Jordan of the US owning and rebuilding [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  Gaza as a Middle Eastern Riviera [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=120.86s)]
*  They've all fiercely refused that proposal just as they've long refused to take in Palestinian refugees [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=122.89999999999999s)]
*  But Jordan's King Abdullah struck a different turn on his visit to the White House this week [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=128.45999999999998s)]
*  Pledge to take in 2006 children from Gaza hailing Trump as a peacemaking visionary [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=132.42s)]
*  Mr. President, I truly believe that with all the challenges that we have in the Middle East that I finally see [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  Somebody that could take us across the finish line to bring stability peace and prosperity to all of us in the region [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=144.42s)]
*  So is Trump successfully bluffing to get deals done and then claim credit for a ceasefire reprieve or is he running the reckless risk? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  Of eventually needing a bite to match his bark [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=158.01999999999998s)]
*  Well during debate all this is check you go the host and founder of the young Turks the commentator and author [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  But here on the saga Dave Smith host of part of the problem and the actor and commentator Dean Kane [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=165.94s)]
*  Well, welcome to all of you [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  Check you go. I mean look Trump's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  literally ignited a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=177.73999999999998s)]
*  ferocious firestorm of debate with this Gaza Riviera plan [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=180.45999999999998s)]
*  As with so many things that Trump does [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=185.26000000000002s)]
*  The immediate response I would have is well [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=188.18s)]
*  What does he really want here and I suspect what he really wants is for? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  The leaders of Arab countries in the Middle East to step up and come up with a workable plan [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=194.34s)]
*  that actually gets things sorted because [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=200.22000000000003s)]
*  Trump's right. Nothing else has worked [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=205.42s)]
*  Trump is not right about one thing here his plan is obviously asinine [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  We all can acknowledge that it has no chance of success. It's ridiculous [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=212.01999999999998s)]
*  But more importantly, why is he doing it? Can we be honest here? I know in mainstream media and cable news [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=217.42s)]
*  You can't say this. Can we say this here? Yes, obviously because of his donors [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=223.38s)]
*  Right. I mean Miriam Adelson gave him that Adelson family over three elections gave him $330,000 [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=228.14s)]
*  million dollars [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=234.1s)]
*  Herets reported that she wanted [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=236.1s)]
*  Portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip's annexed. So why is Trump saying we're going to own it? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=238.66s)]
*  He's trying to trick MAGA into thinking after we let the Israelis slaughter more Palestinians as they try to push [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=243.54s)]
*  2 million people out of their homes and their homeland and after we finance that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=251.14s)]
*  Slaughter which we're definitely going to finance because Trump and to be fair to Trump [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=257.78s)]
*  Almost all the Democrats all Washington is owned by Israel [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=262.90000000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu dog-walked Trump around the park made him look like a waiter as he was putting his chair in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=267.22s)]
*  So we're gonna pay for all that slaughter and then Trump goes, oh don't worry because we're gonna own it later [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=272.90000000000003s)]
*  We're not gonna own anything. You think Israel's gonna give it back to us? No, they're going to steal that land [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=279.22s)]
*  This was never about self-defense. We were right all along [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=285.86s)]
*  It was always about the theft of Palestinian land. We told you so. All right back to you your response [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=289.46s)]
*  I think that there's a really important point to be made here [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=297.54s)]
*  Which is that no Palestinians have been allowed to flee this war zone because of course Israel was not going to let in [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=301.3s)]
*  civilians from Gaza who may have Hamas members hiding amongst them but also Egypt did not allow [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=311.7s)]
*  almost a single Palestinian to exit the Gaza Strip Trump has been very clear that what he imagines here [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=318.58s)]
*  rightly or wrongly is the voluntary resettlement of Palestinians who wish to leave Gaza now I know a lot of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=327.38s)]
*  Palestinians who would rather live in the rubble than leave their homeland and I respect that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=336.98s)]
*  but 40 percent of Gazans before this war were either employed by Hamas by the public sector [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=341.54s)]
*  or by UNRWA or by jobs in Israel none of those streams of revenue are going to exist now and so [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=348.82000000000005s)]
*  the question I think we need to be asking is this does the international community owe it to the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=356.82000000000005s)]
*  people of Gaza to continue subsidizing their living in Gaza under Hamas rule because that is [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=363.62s)]
*  essentially what has been happening until now now of course I do not support any sort of forceful [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=372.42s)]
*  removal of anybody from their homeland but I don't think that's what Trump is imagining it was very [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=379.22s)]
*  clear from the press conference that there's going to be this meeting in Riyadh between the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=385.38000000000005s)]
*  Saudis between the Jordanians and between the Egyptians all of whom have done nothing to help [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=389.94s)]
*  the Palestinians forever and so I think this question becomes who owes who what and that's [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=395.22s)]
*  really what Trump is trying to introduce here is a new path forward. Well Dave Smith you said about [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=401.06s)]
*  the plan I called it insane ethnic cleansing and the worst proposal a president can make [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=406.42s)]
*  and the worst proposal a president can make but if what it achieves is it gets everybody [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=412.65999999999997s)]
*  in a room actually properly debating a solution to all this isn't it a means to an end? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=419.7s)]
*  Well I guess you could say that about anything like if he doesn't come through on what he's [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=427.21999999999997s)]
*  saying he's going to do and then something else better comes out of it perhaps but it look it [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=434.34s)]
*  doesn't the plan itself doesn't make any sense I don't think Batia's right to say that it was [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=439.78s)]
*  clear that this is going to be voluntary I mean at best that was unclear the only thing that Trump [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=445.21999999999997s)]
*  made crystal clear is that they would not be allowed back in he said that explicitly in the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=450.34s)]
*  interview with with Brett Baier and the problem even I think appears with the idea which a lot [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  of Trump supporters and I voted for him in this election but a lot of Trump supporters are saying [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=460.82s)]
*  oh this is just a Trump negotiating tactic the problem with that angle is that it doesn't even [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=464.58s)]
*  make sense as a negotiating tactic I mean who are you putting pressure on here like the idea is you [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=469.85999999999996s)]
*  would have to in order to have a negotiating tactic here you would have to be putting some pressure [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=475.3s)]
*  on Israel I mean the idea that we're going to put more pressure on the people of Gaza I think they [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=479.14s)]
*  felt quite enough pressure over the last nearly year and a half now and many decades before that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=484.58s)]
*  but this is just so even just to float this out as a starting point in a negotiation is so outrageous [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=489.94s)]
*  I have the idea that Israel breaks it and then we buy it after Israel as we all know on this panel [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=496.34s)]
*  has used their significant influence like even if you don't want to go quite as far as Cenk [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=502.74s)]
*  and say that you know the politicians in America are owned by Israel although he's got an argument [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=507.06s)]
*  there Israel has used their significant influence to push America into the entire terror wars of the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=511.62s)]
*  last 25 years Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli war cabinet has still been trying to pressure us [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=518.5s)]
*  to fight a war with Iran another catastrophic war in the middle east this is what these guys want [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=523.94s)]
*  and now we are responsible for cleaning up their mess it's an outrage it is the antithesis of [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=528.82s)]
*  America first and the antithesis of the spirit in which so many people the reason why so many [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=535.14s)]
*  people supported Donald Trump's a break from the permanent war party. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=540.34s)]

*  Trump's position is look all right give me a better option in other words if it's not America that [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=645.86s)]

*  we want to try something new what we could try is not giving Israel unconditional support and arming [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=665.4599999999999s)]
*  and financing but that's not my question my question is who actually who is going to rebuild Gaza I can [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=672.3399999999999s)]
*  answer appears okay the responsibility ought to be on Israel yeah okay yeah so uh as you know [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=677.46s)]
*  appears from day one what I said was Israel should use special forces this bombing of indiscriminate [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=685.94s)]
*  bombing in the buildings was outrageous it was always meant to level it hold on so then what I [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=691.0600000000001s)]
*  said after that appears if you remember is you should do a deal with the Palestinian Authority [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=695.86s)]
*  and the West Bank to give the occupied territories back to the Palestinians where it belongs and have [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=700.18s)]
*  a two-state solution that we've always fought for and that way they would have the authority and the [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=707.78s)]
*  credibility to be able to push Hamas out of the Gaza Strip who rebuilds Gaza who pays for it? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=712.8199999999999s)]
*  The U.S. doesn't have to do it yeah I know I know I'm getting to it and so then I know Israel would [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=717.62s)]
*  never pay for anything they try to make us pay for it all their bills so you can't you so then [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=723.14s)]
*  you go to the Arab countries United Arab Emirates Qatar Saudi Arabia and you say oh my god we got a [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=728.66s)]
*  deal we got a two-state solution the Palestinians are going to finally have a homeland now you guys [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=734.1s)]
*  pay for the rebuilding I guarantee you that they do that that is an easy solution the only thing [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=738.02s)]
*  blocking that solution that way America doesn't pay anything there's no more killing there's peace [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=743.14s)]
*  the only ones blocking that are Israel because they don't want two states they want to steal Gaza [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=747.62s)]
*  and now they just said it they want it they're going to steal it so there's no question about it [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=752.9s)]
*  Cenk it all sounds utopian and so easy except that of course you've still got a large Hamas presence [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=758.8199999999999s)]
*  as we see with the release of all these hostages we believe from American intelligence that for [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=765.14s)]
*  every Hamas terrorist who's been killed they've already been replaced the ideology may have anything [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=769.9399999999999s)]
*  have been fueled and that ideology is committed to the destruction of all things Israel so this [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=774.3399999999999s)]
*  this this full utopia no no no no there's no relation to reality it's not utopian super simple [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=780.0999999999999s)]
*  no no no no no first of all peers you leave it to the Palestinians that's why I'm saying do the deal [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=788.02s)]
*  with the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank you leave it to the Palestinians to drive Hamas [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=794.74s)]
*  out so that's their internal business but in order to do that you have to have a deal for a two-state [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=798.5s)]
*  solution and you make the Middle Eastern countries the Arab countries that have always said that they [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=804.42s)]
*  want an independent Palestine pay for rebuilding Palestine it makes perfect sense the old and if [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=808.66s)]
*  it does right to the point okay look you have me you have me right to the point you say the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=814.34s)]
*  Palestinian you're going to the same talking point I get it how Palestinians are always going to be [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=818.34s)]
*  terrorists I get it that's a ridiculous racist Israeli propaganda I don't think that at all but [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=823.7800000000001s)]
*  I think the idea that the Palestinian Authority will simply go bang and Hamas disappear forget it [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=828.4200000000001s)]
*  um Dean Cain let me bring you in here you've been waiting very simple but yeah of course that's what [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=833.38s)]
*  you do well and they might be brutal about it but that's Palestinian business you've got a guy [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=837.62s)]
*  American business you've got a guy in his 80s running the Palestinian Authority right I do not [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=842.5s)]
*  entrust him frankly with all due respect to run Hamas out of town anyway let me bring let me bring [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=846.5s)]
*  you a perfectly viable solution all right perfectly viable let me and you're and you're coming out [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=852.9s)]
*  with excuses because Israel wants Gaza be honest I'm not coming up with any excuses can you admit [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=857.78s)]
*  that Israel clearly clearly wants to steal Gaza isn't that wasn't that the certainly belief of [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=862.18s)]
*  well let me ask let me ask you I certainly believe there are people in Netanyahu's cabinet [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=867.6999999999999s)]
*  Ben Gavir Smodrich and others who absolutely would like that that's been my problem with this [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=872.74s)]
*  for a long time let me bring in and bring Dean Cain to be waiting patiently I mean Dean look [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=877.2199999999999s)]
*  you know a lot of people are outraged as always by what Trump has suggested but is there merit to his [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=882.5s)]
*  apparent madness absolutely 100% look we're just failing to talk about here is October 7th [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=888.5799999999999s)]
*  you know you and I'll quote Douglas Murray here you don't get to start a war and then complain [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=897.14s)]
*  when you lose it and there are consequences to losing it and Hamas needs to be absolutely driven [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=902.1s)]
*  out and and and ended in Gaza that's that's unequivocal otherwise they're going to completely [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=907.38s)]
*  keep going with the same circle teaching people through UNRWA and and the schooling there that [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=914.26s)]
*  Israelis are drinking Israelis are drinking your blood etc etc etc they're fomenting this [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=918.98s)]
*  we're paying for half of this stuff the USAID and the other things that are going on it's [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=923.22s)]
*  ridiculous I think Israel has every right to step up I think President Trump has made it clear that [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=927.5400000000001s)]
*  he's going to back them 100% unlike this last administration and I think we'll actually see [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=932.34s)]
*  something really happen in this in this in this area but the problem yeah but the problem the [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=936.9s)]
*  problem seems to me is there is there is no real evidence that Hamas have been defeated in fact if [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=942.4200000000001s)]
*  anything these propaganda videos they're showing with the hostages there seem to be a lot of Hamas [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=947.94s)]
*  and a lot of support for Hamas for the certainly in the early ones and and I think that would be [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=953.14s)]
*  very I can't believe they don't love Israel whatever this has been my problem again [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=959.46s)]
*  my problem again 62 000 people there yeah but just go back to you forget what happened they [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=963.22s)]
*  don't love Israel that's so shocking well hang on I'm going to go back to yeah would you love [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=967.46s)]
*  your oppressors I would love people who murdered my family there you sound like you know [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=971.22s)]
*  like one of the Israelis wrong the Palestinians didn't start this war Israel started it with the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=980.18s)]
*  occupation you don't get to occupy Texas for 57 years and if Texas fights back go oh look at the [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=985.2199999999999s)]
*  terrorists in Texas they started the war no Israel definitively started a war America first I'm tired [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=991.2199999999999s)]
*  of them Israel first Israel first give them 300 billion dollars pay for their genocides get out [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=997.62s)]
*  of there America first and let these poor people Palestinians go the number one problem is [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1004.0999999999999s)]
*  Israel and they're infinite greed for land land land and slaughter so just to be clear everybody [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1010.18s)]
*  knows just to be clear because you're going a bit further than you had before just to be clear you [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1015.9399999999999s)]
*  think October the seventh was an inevitable consequence of the way the Palestinian people [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1020.5799999999999s)]
*  have been treated [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1025.3799999999999s)]
*  guys I hate October 7th when the Hamas does violence they they do so much damage to the [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1028.82s)]
*  Palestinians the Muslims so but two things can be true at the same time you could have something awful [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1035.78s)]
*  and then you could use your brain to figure out hey why did that happen and does anyone think that [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1041.54s)]
*  any American wouldn't fight back if they were occupied and humiliated and their land stolen and [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1046.82s)]
*  their families bullied and harassed and humiliated for 57 straight years of course we would fight [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1053.06s)]
*  back of course any set of human beings would fight back but when Israel oppresses them and uses their [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1059.54s)]
*  might of their giant military to crush them that's not terrorism but if Palestinians fight back [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1065.14s)]
*  terrorists it's absurd it's propaganda it's both terrorism okay so yes the Hamas doing terrorism [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1071.6200000000001s)]
*  is despicable and when Israel does 60 times the terrorism of Hamas we should call them what they [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1077.94s)]
*  are a terrorist state and we should stop funding them don't send our taxpayer money to go fund [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1084.74s)]
*  terrorist government of Israel all right back to your response [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1090.82s)]
*  I just want to talk about this idea of Israel owning the United States government because it [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1095.62s)]
*  seems to me that people who make that argument want to have it both ways on the one hand we give [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1100.8999999999999s)]
*  Israel exorbitant amounts of money and on the other hand somehow they control us through the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1104.6599999999999s)]
*  money that we give them and it's never been clear to me like what do they use for that control so [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1110.58s)]
*  people will say APEC but APEC spends about three million dollars on local races in America on [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1116.18s)]
*  congressional races it's not a lot of money number one donor in this campaign cycle the Israel lobby [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1122.18s)]
*  is the number one donor they're literally driving the American people is the fact that Americans [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1128.02s)]
*  are supportive of Israel it's like the way that the NRA was popular when it was because Americans [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1134.18s)]
*  like their guns these lobbyists are they're powerful to the extent that they reflect views [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1141.3s)]
*  that the American people already have and I think that's a really important point to point out here [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1147.54s)]
*  because you cannot take an unpopular view and just use money in order to push it and nothing has [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1153.3s)]
*  proven that like this last election cycle take Nikki Haley Nikki Haley outspent Donald Trump [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1162.58s)]
*  two to one Kamala Harris outspent Donald Trump two to one money in politics has been revealed to be [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1169.78s)]
*  nothing compared to the will of the American people this is an amazing thing I mean I was [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1178.26s)]
*  as a lefty I was really against Citizens United and it turns out actually the American electorate [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1183.54s)]
*  has a very clear idea of what it wants if you look at Donald Trump's cabinet every single person in [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1188.58s)]
*  that cabinet which is by the way the most diverse ideological cabinet in American history it's not [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1194.42s)]
*  they all have a very similar view of what it means to be America first there's only one thing that [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1200.26s)]
*  they all share and they all seem to think that having a pro-Israel point of view is very much [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1206.18s)]
*  inherent in the America first ideology because Israel is a good ally Israel brings a lot to the [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1212.74s)]
*  table we get a lot more bang for our buck in fact I think Israel should stop taking aid from the [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1219.06s)]
*  United States because I think Israel has paid a much higher price for that aid in terms of its [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1225.3s)]
*  sovereignty it has been bad for Israel to take all this money because it means that the Americans [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1230.26s)]
*  can tell them what to do and they shouldn't accept that they should be sovereign nations I'll just [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1235.54s)]
*  make one more quick point sovereignty is not something you can give somebody it's not a gift [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1239.62s)]
*  you can give to another nation I feel for the Palestinian people but the idea that somehow [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1245.3799999999999s)]
*  Israel which won its sovereignty through winning wars owes them something in the form of a sovereign [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1250.9s)]
*  state this is just ridiculous like this doesn't actually make any sense. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1257.94s)]
*  Shank you said who should rebuild Gaza you said the Arab nations should rebuild Gaza in exchange [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1261.7800000000002s)]
*  for the two-state solution but what Trump is about to do is get a deal in which they rebuild Gaza [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1267.38s)]
*  without actually having to have a two-state solution so he's actually sort of a little bit [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1272.5800000000002s)]
*  ahead of the game in the way that he often turns out to be okay let me bring in no [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1276.74s)]
*  do you know how unrealistic that is you think Saudi Arabia is going to pay for Israel to occupy [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1281.7s)]
*  Gaza nobody's going to pay no I don't think Israel wants to occupy Gaza at all they're not that big a [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1286.8200000000002s)]
*  sucker if Israel wanted to occupy Gaza no it's absurd Gaza right now none of them will clearly [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1291.6200000000001s)]
*  doesn't want to be occupying Gaza yeah none of them will do that why shank according to you why [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1296.8200000000002s)]
*  is Israel not currently occupying Gaza if they want it so badly because they're waiting for [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1301.22s)]
*  America to give them permission they were waiting for this election that's why they supported Trump [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1308.18s)]
*  so Kamala Harris and Joe Biden were terrible on this issue they gave Israel everything they wanted [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1312.42s)]
*  but they but Netanyahu made a deal with Trump and that became obvious to me that the reason for that [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1317.14s)]
*  was just Trump was going to give them even more which is just to let them grab this land in Gaza [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1321.54s)]
*  which is going to cause a massive conflict and guess who's going to pay for it we're all going [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1326.98s)]
*  to pay for it okay let me bring in come on you know the donors control things the drug companies [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1331.54s)]
*  are deeply unpopular and they win every time in congress all right let me bring it by our congress [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1335.94s)]
*  and so does Israel made the point let me bring in Dave Smith Dave the immediate big picture here [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1340.9s)]
*  is that uh there's been you know a big uh fracturing of the agreement in terms of releasing [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1347.22s)]
*  hostages Hamas and so on and it's now coming to a head on Saturday where Trump says if they don't [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1353.3s)]
*  release all of the hostages by Saturday uh midday I think he said and all hell will break loose [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1358.3400000000001s)]
*  supposed to be three hostages being released Netanyahu now no longer says three but doesn't [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1364.5s)]
*  give an actual number he just says uh many I think um so you've got three different positions here [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1368.98s)]
*  um either way it feels like a very precarious moment in this process what do you make of it [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1375.62s)]
*  yeah well I mean I certainly agree it's a it's a precarious moment um you know it there was a [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1383.54s)]
*  good piece in the New York Times um about this I mean where even um some Israeli officials were [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1388.98s)]
*  admitting that they haven't held up their end of the ceasefire either um there's been a bunch of [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1394.26s)]
*  Palestinians killed uh during this ceasefire um you know the problem here I think with Trump's [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1398.42s)]
*  negotiating posture is that again it's just all the pressure is just trying to put more pressure [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1405.78s)]
*  on Hamas and on Gaza but there's two parties here and I think at the very least people could [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1411.22s)]
*  acknowledge that like there has to be some pressure on both of them and and this is what [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1416.58s)]
*  you know I just want to respond to a couple of the things Batya was saying because there actually [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1420.58s)]
*  was really interesting news that you was broke on your show here Piers if you remember back um a few [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1425.06s)]
*  weeks ago when you hosted a debate between uh Wesley Clark and Scott Horton yeah and four star [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1430.8999999999999s)]
*  general Wesley Clark who's probably most famous for his seven countries in five years um comment [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1436.5s)]
*  that he had seen that this plan was all he revealed very casually on your show that actually he had [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1443.3799999999999s)]
*  seen these plans back in 1991 and you know where they came from they came from Paul Wolfowitz and [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1448.26s)]
*  he said this was sanctioned by Israel that Israel under George HW Bush's administration had the plan [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1453.3s)]
*  to topple all of these governments this is a decade before 9-11 and then of course they lost [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1459.7s)]
*  the election the plan got um reignited when George W Bush took over but to body the body's point there [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1464.34s)]
*  was no there was no groundswelling of support from the American people to overthrow Momar [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1471.86s)]
*  Gaddafi or to start a civil war in Syria or to or even to overthrow Saddam Hussein this was totally [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1477.3799999999999s)]
*  a top-down move largely done by Israeli influence and so it's just not the case that what's popular [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1484.1799999999998s)]
*  is always going to rise to the top and that politics and business have no influence on this [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1493.1399999999999s)]
*  and I'm not a lefty I'm not like I don't care about getting money out of politics I care about [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1498.5s)]
*  getting politics out of money I want to see the size and scope of the government drastically [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1502.74s)]
*  reduced so it doesn't even really matter who owns the thing and I'm I think Elon and Trump are doing [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1506.66s)]
*  a great job on that front or at least starting to but you know this is just the idea of what we're [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1512.02s)]
*  gonna look Pierce the thing that's kind of frustrating here right is that I sit here on [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1518.02s)]
*  your show six months ago eight months ago and I say you're never going to be able to get rid of [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1523.14s)]
*  Hamas you're just going to get more Hamas or Hamas like groups yeah doing this yeah and then we and [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1528.42s)]
*  then we turn around and then all the pro-Israel you know are people they just act like that point [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1533.7800000000002s)]
*  never happened we just move on to whatever the next like topic is but what are you guys going to [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1537.94s)]
*  do start bombing the rubble I mean like for god's sakes like have a little bit of humanity the [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1541.6200000000001s)]
*  numbers look Donald Trump by the way I think Cenk is wrong when he's floating out you know [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1547.46s)]
*  remember all those months were on this show people would always argue whether you can trust [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1551.3s)]
*  the Ministry of Health's numbers or not that argument's over it's way higher than what they [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1555.3799999999999s)]
*  were estimating Donald Trump the other day said there's 1.9 million people in Gaza [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1560.34s)]
*  okay that's 400,000 shy of what we started with I'm not claiming to know what the exact numbers are [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1565.86s)]
*  but this is just so I mean like on any level this is biblical levels of evil you're just going to [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1571.22s)]
*  start bombing these people again and think that's going to solve the problem yeah I mean I think [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1576.5s)]
*  these are very valid questions I've been saying for many months what's the plan for the end of [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1582.18s)]
*  this because it seemed to me there was no actual evidence that the ideology was being removed [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1586.5s)]
*  whatsoever in fact quite the opposite it looked like support for Hamas was growing in Gaza because [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1592.34s)]
*  of the scale of the of the retribution from Israel for October the 7th Dean I mean my question for [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1598.82s)]
*  you would be just on a human level if you were suddenly told along with your entire neighborhood [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1605.38s)]
*  right you've all got to leave right and you can't come back instinctively on a human level you'd be [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1611.7800000000002s)]
*  like sorry what no it's in my home I'm not going anywhere and even if they told me that if they [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1617.46s)]
*  told me that in a sort of a blank slate but if people had done what happened on October 7th [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1624.66s)]
*  and then you get removed from that area I don't know how much you can complain and when they're [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1628.9s)]
*  pushing that but why should but why should two million people be punished for the actions of [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1632.74s)]
*  50 000 people in Hamas well what is the what is the uh percent of support for Hamas within [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1637.38s)]
*  the within the Gaza well it's hard to gauge what it really is because rather like in Russia and [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1645.54s)]
*  other places when you have a controlling body in a country who rule by fear and violence and [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1649.38s)]
*  intimidation and murder then often people are not going to be honest in polling right so we don't [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1654.74s)]
*  really know I mean I've seen enough scenes you said it perfectly there's a lot of support but [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1659.78s)]
*  I think to punish to collectively punish two million people which is what is going on here [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1663.94s)]
*  under this plan that seems to me to be almost the embodiment of ethnic cleansing isn't it I [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1670.1s)]
*  mean if you if you're forcing them against their will to leave their homes and not allow them back [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1676.18s)]
*  that is by the definition of the phrase ethnic cleansing well it's it's not a genocide and it's [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1682.18s)]
*  not ethnic cleansing there are plenty of arab um jews or non-jews in inside of israel it's that [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1688.82s)]
*  it's hamas it's that but they're voluntarily hang on hang on they're they're they're there [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1695.86s)]
*  voluntarily the point about ethnic cleansing is where a group of people are removed from a place [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1700.74s)]
*  where they live against their wishes that is called ethnic cleansing it's called the consequences of a [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1707.46s)]
*  war and a war that was started by hamas on october 7th period you do that let me tell you what [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1714.74s)]
*  anybody on this panel if your kid was one among those that were taken hostage and pulled across [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1723.06s)]
*  what would you do to get him back I would do anything yeah but I would read anything I agree [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1727.7s)]
*  with you okay Dean I agree with you but what would you do why don't we ever apply that to the other [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1732.1s)]
*  side what I was about to say your point I would I would do anything but what about the Palestinian [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1736.42s)]
*  children who have died in such greater number who have been so much more oppressed [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1742.26s)]
*  but but quit putting you know rockets and things in schools quit putting I mean there's no question [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1747.94s)]
*  what hamas is doing by by burying all their things right in the schoolyards right in the churches [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1753.78s)]
*  right in the mosques wherever it is in areas they do that and then what do you do how do you how do [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1758.5s)]
*  you respond to that at a certain point in time have you seen the pictures have you seen the pictures [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1763.78s)]
*  of Gaza are you telling me there was hamas there were hamas missiles in every single one of those [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1768.1s)]
*  buildings that that's the entirety of the story is that Israel just had to blow up this building [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1773.1399999999999s)]
*  which by the way still I don't think would be morally justified but like come on man look like [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1777.62s)]
*  it's just again even to Dean's point I always find this fascinating because somehow Americans [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1782.6599999999999s)]
*  could say this about the people in hamas and go like you know like you said yeah I wouldn't like [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1786.8999999999999s)]
*  to be kicked out of my neighborhood but if my if my government had done October 7th I'd accept it [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1791.54s)]
*  your government Dean destroyed Iraq Afghanistan Libya Syria Somalia Yemen the drone bombing [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1797.3s)]
*  campaign in Pakistan so like what are can you get kicked out of your house now is it not ethnic [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1805.22s)]
*  cleansing if we were to kick you out of your neighborhood this is so ridiculous that we impose [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1809.86s)]
*  these standards on these poor people that we would never dream of holding ourselves to that standard [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1814.18s)]
*  it's just it logically makes absolutely no sense and it doesn't really matter what hamas's approval [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1820.58s)]
*  rating is in the same way that it doesn't matter that George W Bush had record high approval [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1825.94s)]
*  ratings that doesn't mean that the innocent civilians of the United States of America are [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1830.1000000000001s)]
*  fair game and neither should any other group of civilians okay back to your response can I just [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1833.94s)]
*  jump in for a second I feel a little bit like Dave I appreciate what you're saying but I feel a little [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1838.9s)]
*  bit like you're trying to have it both ways on the one hand you're saying you know hamas as an [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1842.8200000000002s)]
*  ideology will never be defeated you know ergo there is this sort of widespread support for it [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1847.46s)]
*  you know on the other hand you're asking Israel to live side by side and treat the population of [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1853.78s)]
*  Gaza as innocent now I happen to agree with the latter I think Hamas is I don't understand why [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1859.54s)]
*  everybody keeps saying that they're so popular the latest polling have shown Hamas support is [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1865.94s)]
*  down to 20 percent I've even seen polls at seven percent because the people of Gaza the innocent [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1871.3s)]
*  people of Gaza understand who brought this upon them Hamas is much more popular right now in the [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1877.3s)]
*  West Bank than it is in Gaza because people in the West Bank have not had to well a little bit [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1882.74s)]
*  they've had to bear the costs of what happened on October 7th but mostly it's been the people [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1886.9s)]
*  in Gaza and I think that to ignore the historic unpopularity of Hamas is truly criminal it's to [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1891.7s)]
*  suggest that we cannot imagine a life for the Palestinians in Gaza in their homeland not living [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1899.3s)]
*  under the brutal regime of Hamas Hamas is only able to attack Israel in a very limited way [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1906.82s)]
*  you know October 7th was not some act of like unbelievable genius they broke a goddamn fence [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1913.54s)]
*  because Israel wasn't looking at the fence right it was like the most easy obvious stupid thing [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1920.1799999999998s)]
*  right when actually right now Hamas's ability to actually kill Israelis is going to be back to what [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1925.62s)]
*  it was before October 7th which is very very minimal this is not like an unbelievably [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1932.42s)]
*  sophisticated group here and what I don't understand is why do we think it is compassion [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1937.46s)]
*  to the Palestinians to um to to sentence them to live under a brutal dictatorship [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1943.7s)]
*  that murders and tortures and steals food from its own people and I'm not saying that we should have [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1950.66s)]
*  some sort of you know plan here for regime change or whatnot but I'm saying that there seems to be [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1956.42s)]
*  this weird view that the primary victims of Hamas are Israelis and they are not they're the people [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1962.02s)]
*  of Gaza and again Pierce I don't think the question is one of ethnic cleansing because Trump you're [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1967.7s)]
*  right Dave he did say they can't go back but he also then very quickly said they're not going to [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1973.78s)]
*  want to he is picturing a situation in which young Gazans are given an opportunity to leave [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1978.5s)]
*  and seek a life elsewhere an option a choice which they have not been given ever before and [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1985.7s)]
*  the question is should they be given that choice or should they be subsidized by the international [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1992.02s)]
*  community to continue living under the brutal regime of terrorist dictators? The problem back here, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=1997.46s)]
*  all right hang on hang on look there's a lot to unpack there but the the immediate problem is none [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2001.94s)]
*  of the Arab states want to do this so this plan is not going to go anywhere because none of them [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2006.02s)]
*  are prepared to take in two million Palestinian refugees least of all Jordan. People always say [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2011.14s)]
*  that when Trump starts a negotiation no one's going to do this look at what he achieved Pierce [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2016.66s)]
*  over the last three weeks with tariffs he got everything he wanted every single time. There's [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2020.98s)]
*  a very big difference between tariffs and two million refugees. The idea to even make the [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2027.46s)]
*  comparison of Mexico or Canada sending 10 000 troops to their border then compare that to [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2033.5400000000002s)]
*  Jordan or Egypt taking in a million refugees each is just I mean they view this as an existential [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2040.1799999999998s)]
*  threat to their regime and there's lots of historical reasons for that but like there's [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2046.34s)]
*  just no comparison between getting that concession and getting this one but I think budget like I [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2050.9s)]
*  think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying I'm not saying Hamas could never be defeated I'm not [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2056.74s)]
*  saying that the Palestinians are sentenced to live under Hamas forever I don't think it's it's our [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2060.9s)]
*  job to determine who their government is if we wanted to use that justification we could justify [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2066.1s)]
*  having regime change in the majority of governments around the world the point is that I'm saying [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2070.3399999999997s)]
*  Hamas cannot be defeated like this or at least a similar ideology you'll either have Hamas or a [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2075.14s)]
*  Hamas like group as I've said on the show before this is um um general McChrystal not a libertarian [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2081.14s)]
*  dove like me it was he's the one who coined the term insurgent math what's 10 minus 20 the more [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2087.62s)]
*  you keep doing this everybody every time you kill a little girl they had a father and a brother and [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2093.86s)]
*  an uncle and you just get more people so Hamas might be less powerful because or less popular [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2099.46s)]
*  excuse me because they have been unable to protect their people but they'll be just just be looking [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2104.6600000000003s)]
*  for the next most gangster protector that they can provide okay no no no that's supported for [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2109.38s)]
*  support for the two-state solution in Gaza has grown since October 7th by leaps and bounds like [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2116.98s)]
*  the exact opposite of that no no it's not it's not at all that's not what I'm saying so now let [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2122.98s)]
*  me say to your other point and I don't even think you realize you did this but you just gave the [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2128.9s)]
*  whole game away like you just totally gave away any justification Israel has for this when you say [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2133.22s)]
*  October 7th wasn't some genius thing we just weren't looking at the wall we could just look [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2138.58s)]
*  at the wall you know I think I think Pierce a lot of times in as I've watched so many debates on on [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2142.1s)]
*  your show about this over the last year people argue the number of people who are dead people [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2146.98s)]
*  argue the civilian to combatant ratio all of this is irrelevant okay when you look at the unimaginable [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2152.18s)]
*  amount of profound human suffering that Israel has inflicted on Gaza over the last year plus [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2161.2999999999997s)]
*  the only relevant question is do you absolutely have to do this is there any alternative well [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2167.06s)]
*  also well I would say if there's if there's not if that's not the case if you're saying we could [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2173.86s)]
*  just keep our eye on that wall yeah then you have absolutely no excuse to do this but I would I [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2178.66s)]
*  would say I would say what I'm sorry hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2183.22s)]
*  that's right obvious the fact that it's okay I just want to respond to that because you know we've [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2188.8199999999997s)]
*  done a lot of debates like you say uh I mean most of us have been debating this all year on this show [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2193.06s)]
*  um here's what I would say that from the from like two maybe two three weeks in I began asking [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2197.62s)]
*  two questions repeatedly what what is a proportionate response and what is the what [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2204.74s)]
*  is the end game and one of them was what happens when this is over and nobody really on the [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2209.14s)]
*  Israeli side ever had a real answer for this right and it seems to me that the scale of a response [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2213.7799999999997s)]
*  given that Hamas if the mission was to eradicate Hamas that has simply not happened so that has [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2220.1s)]
*  not been achieved so the victory that Netanyahu wanted which was the elimination of Hamas I don't [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2227.62s)]
*  think anybody would argue that that has been achieved and so we are where we are with that [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2234.02s)]
*  secondly there's no question that in terms of the plan for the end of this there wasn't one right [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2239.62s)]
*  that's why Trump has come up with this idea because nobody else has come up with a plan which makes [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2245.62s)]
*  any sense to him you know the the Arab countries do not really really want to get involved in [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2250.42s)]
*  rebuilding Gaza or taking in any uh refugees they expect America to pick up the bill for this and [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2255.46s)]
*  to do it do it themselves Trump says fine but if we're going to do that it'll take a year two years [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2260.98s)]
*  who knows three years I mean Gaza's been destroyed what happens to these people in the meantime it's [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2266.66s)]
*  uninhabitable for anyone with families he's right about that where do they go what do they do [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2271.78s)]
*  and he's offering one solution which they're all saying is ridiculous well okay what's the other [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2277.14s)]
*  one and that seems to me to be where we've got to where the mission cannot be categorized as a [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2282.18s)]
*  victory when you've got this level of civilian death and the people you were trying to eradicate [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2288.58s)]
*  are still there in large numbers and the ideology has not been dismantled in fact it's probably [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2293.62s)]
*  been fueled then I'm not sure what kind of victory it feels a very pyrrhic victory I mean check let [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2299.22s)]
*  me bring you in here it just feels to me like a very pyrrhic victory that is very likely to blow [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2305.14s)]
*  up in Israel's face because they've simply gone too far yeah so Piers as you know and I just did [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2311.3s)]
*  it again today I'm a rare person who keeps offering a constructive solution and that solution has the [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2319.78s)]
*  Arab states paying instead of America paying it has the Palestinians taking care of their own [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2326.1000000000004s)]
*  country instead of us taking care of it or Israel taking care of it so and and it checks off all [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2331.7000000000003s)]
*  those boxes and I want you guys to understand how practical it is because oftentimes peace is [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2337.54s)]
*  shown as impossible or impractical but Israel actually already did this we have a model for it [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2342.98s)]
*  their peace deal with Egypt and so at the time everybody said oh you can't work with Egypt they [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2349.22s)]
*  attacked Israel twice and they did they organized all the Arab nations against Israel twice Egypt [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2354.58s)]
*  is the worst of the worst they'll always attack Israel well those folks who said that were wrong [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2359.62s)]
*  Egypt never attacked Israel again it's been a stalwart ally and the peace deal work and then [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2365.22s)]
*  people said well okay we're condemning the Egyptians to live under Mubarak and and military rule etc but [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2371.2999999999997s)]
*  that's Egypt's business that's not our business so let the Palestinians handle their own business [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2377.7s)]
*  and and Piers you said there's never been a plan here no there's always been a plan they just didn't [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2382.8999999999996s)]
*  want to say it in public because they're pretending that this was about self-defense October 7th [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2387.4599999999996s)]
*  happened 15 months ago I mean they've destroyed almost every building in Gaza the plan is obvious [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2391.7s)]
*  and they're now finally announcing it which is that Israel's going to take it that's why they [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2397.7799999999997s)]
*  never had realistic ceasefire proposals that's why they never drove towards peace that's why they [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2402.3399999999997s)]
*  never want the two-state solution because they want one state Israel from the river to the sea [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2407.06s)]
*  and then yahoo has literally said from the river to the sea we're going to have all of it so we're [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2412.02s)]
*  all pretending that Israel doesn't want to take this land when that's been their intent all along [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2417.62s)]
*  and why are we pretending that because APAC was the number one donor in politics in this election [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2422.02s)]
*  cycle Donald Trump's gotten 337 million but Biden got 11 million from APAC Kamala Harris got 5 million [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2426.5s)]
*  from Israeli lobby in this campaign so Washington DC's occupied territory that is why we're not [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2432.58s)]
*  getting to the obvious America first answer which would also make the Palestinians happy [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2439.2999999999997s)]
*  and get peace for Israel and get a safe Jewish haven which we all want for Israel and would stop [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2444.74s)]
*  this madness but we've got to actually go towards the actual practical solution which is peace and [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2450.5s)]
*  a two-state solution and the people blocking that are Netanyahu and his far-right ridiculous government [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2456.58s)]
*  in Israel and Dave is right you put pressure on the people blocking the deal which is Netanyahu [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2462.58s)]
*  and Israel the people in Gaza have almost no power at all the people with nearly you know what maybe [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2467.4599999999996s)]
*  my guess is my guess is that the Arab nations will say right we will let America rebuild Gaza [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2472.98s)]
*  the Palestinian people will not be all forced out the ones who want to stay will be able to stay [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2481.78s)]
*  but it has to be as part of a two-state solution pathway that is specifically laid out and has a [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2487.06s)]
*  timeline I suspect that may be how this ends up anyway we'll see I want to just change to another [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2494.9s)]
*  war briefly and let me start with you Dean on this one this is Ukraine Donald Trump has revealed [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2502.34s)]
*  he's had a very productive call with Vladimir Putin he said we talked about the strength of our [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2507.7000000000003s)]
*  respective nations and the great benefit will someday work together but first we want to stop [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2513.2200000000003s)]
*  the millions of deaths taking place in the war with Russia and Ukraine President Putin even used my [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2518.02s)]
*  strong campaign motto of common sense we both believe in it strongly adding they've agreed to [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2522.26s)]
*  start negotiations immediately and that he will notify Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky of [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2527.38s)]
*  the conversation that apparently is going to happen imminently so there's movement there I [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2533.54s)]
*  interviewed President Zelensky last week and it was clear that he also is prepared to sit around a [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2538.7400000000002s)]
*  negotiating table and try and resolve this but what is your reaction to Donald Trump and his [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2544.58s)]
*  announcement about talking to Putin I he should talk to both sides I'm all for that 100 but I [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2549.06s)]
*  say that under with President Trump's leadership that that war in Ukraine will be over for the end [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2556.9s)]
*  of this calendar year and I think that's what everybody wants since what President Trump has [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2563.62s)]
*  said himself it's like I want to stop the killing I want to stop people from dying and and that war [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2567.2200000000003s)]
*  I believe wholeheartedly will be done by the end of this of this year whatever the concessions are [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2572.5s)]
*  I don't know but but it's going to be done and people will stop dying and that'll be a conflict [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2577.62s)]
*  that that is we've needed to end there's so many people who have been killed there and I'd be I'll [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2584.02s)]
*  be celebrating when it is over and it will be over by the end of this year Dave Smith you know my my [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2589.3s)]
*  concern with this is the only way I can conceivably see this getting resolved anytime soon is that [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2594.98s)]
*  Vladimir Putin gets to keep what he's taken as he did with Crimea I just don't see that the [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2602.2599999999998s)]
*  Ukrainians have enough strength or enough resolve from people like the United States now to continue [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2607.62s)]
*  the battle that and so we're left with where we are on geographic lines which means Putin really [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2613.94s)]
*  you know he wins doesn't he he takes what he's taken again well I mean I I don't know look I [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2620.5s)]
*  get I certainly get your point and I think that we are um can there are constraints to reality and [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2626.42s)]
*  you know look I mean even like I mean uh Cenk as we've been talking about this uh situation in [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2633.3s)]
*  Israel I mean both of us would probably agree that it certainly wasn't legitimate the way [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2639.14s)]
*  the state of Israel was formed to begin with and there was a whole lot of uh ethnic cleansing that [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2644.02s)]
*  went on then but neither of us are arguing that we're saying the Palestinians should have their [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2648.74s)]
*  land in Gaza in the West Bank neither of us are saying like you got it you know what I mean like [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2653.2999999999997s)]
*  tape because at a certain point in time you just have to deal with the reality of the situation [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2656.98s)]
*  right people living that is what you know there is no practical way to force Vladimir Putin out of [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2661.14s)]
*  the areas that he's taken short of the U.S. military rolling in and having a direct [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2666.82s)]
*  confrontation with Russia and I just don't think that any of us are willing to do that so that [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2672.5800000000004s)]
*  the Donbass region is ruled by Kiev rather than Moscow that's just not I'm sorry that's not worth [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2679.54s)]
*  the cost of a total war between America and Russia I hope Dean is right I think this is um uh um an [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2685.1400000000003s)]
*  incredible improvement from the previous administration and their rhetoric and their [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2691.86s)]
*  strategy there and um I give a lot of credit to Pete Pete Hegseth who also um you know just [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2696.6600000000003s)]
*  just recently said some great things on this issue that NATO won't be involved look look I I know that [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2702.02s)]
*  me and you don't agree on this Piers but I'm with Scott Horton and John Mearsheimer on this I think [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2707.38s)]
*  that U.S. uh foreign policy and particularly NATO enlargement color-coded revolutions I think we did [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2712.34s)]
*  a lot to provoke this conflict and I think that much like Israel in the Middle East look America's [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2718.34s)]
*  got all the chips here really when it comes down to it we can get Vladimir Putin to do much of what [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2723.94s)]
*  we would like him to do I would like to see Trump follow through on one of his previous ideas that [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2730.02s)]
*  I think the only chance of actually getting all that Ukrainian territory short of Crimea you're [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2734.98s)]
*  not getting Crimea but the rest of the territory I think you could work out a deal where the U.S. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2739.06s)]
*  pulls out of NATO Donald Trump said it before why on earth are we subsidizing the defense of [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2743.3s)]
*  rich European countries because we worked out this agreement when they were in ashes after World War [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2748.82s)]
*  II to prevent against the Soviet Union well they're not in ashes anymore the Soviet Union [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2753.7000000000003s)]
*  doesn't exist anymore there's no reason why America needs to subsidize the defense of other [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2757.7000000000003s)]
*  rich countries so well I think this is a huge improvement there probably is room for improvement [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2761.86s)]
*  even from there and I don't know I'm not quite as confident as Dean but I really do hope that this [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2767.1400000000003s)]
*  war comes to an end and the killing yeah I mean look the reason we disagree is I wouldn't trust [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2772.02s)]
*  Putin as far as I could throw him and I think he's he's he deeply regrets the Soviet Union ever got [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2776.02s)]
*  broken up and he would love to get it all restored he sees himself as a modern-day czar is my opinion [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2781.86s)]
*  if he only he couldn't even take Kiev so what do you think he's rolling on Poland [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2788.7400000000002s)]
*  he'll end up with a third of Ukraine to go with Crimea right and I just wouldn't trust him I think [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2795.7000000000003s)]
*  that he will try and come again for more of Ukraine and we'll see history will prove one of [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2800.74s)]
*  us right about this I just don't trust him and think he is a ruthless Russian dictator and I [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2805.9399999999996s)]
*  think he's used the the excuse of NATO encroachment when in fact the reason NATO had to be encroached [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2811.14s)]
*  was precisely because of what he's done in Ukraine so it depends which you really want to believe [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2818.18s)]
*  most here and Batsy let me bring you in I mean it seems to me whatever people think of this [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2822.66s)]
*  Donald Trump once again as he's shown since he became president again he steamed in here utterly [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2827.7s)]
*  determined to get this resolved very quickly and he is indisputably a man of peace he does not believe [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2833.62s)]
*  in war he thinks war is bad business it's bad for dead bodies and bad for money that gets wasted I [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2839.06s)]
*  mean it's an unusual thing with an American president you know sitting here in London right [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2845.46s)]
*  now I'm like this is good to have an American president who doesn't like war hallelujah [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2849.8599999999997s)]
*  exactly and first of all utterly delicious for once to be on the same side as Dave of an argument [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2855.46s)]
*  I think the United States should immediately withdraw from NATO I just want to push back on [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2860.5800000000004s)]
*  one thing you said sorry on that wait a minute wait a minute that would be a catastrophe and [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2865.0600000000004s)]
*  I'll tell you why Russia has 6 000 nuclear weapons America has a few less America with Europe has a [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2869.94s)]
*  little bit more than Russia that's why NATO has to stay intact you have to have a strong but but [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2877.6200000000003s)]
*  but where Trump was right is that all the member countries have to pay their way it was completely [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2884.1s)]
*  scandalous they weren't even paying their minimum dues and guess what most of them now are right and [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2890.66s)]
*  the ones who are will soon be bounced out if they're not careful so first of all Trump is right I [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2896.18s)]
*  don't think he wants to dismantle NATO because he understands that NATO collectively actually is [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2900.4199999999996s)]
*  more powerful than Russia if you dismantle it neither America nor Europe Europe as an entity [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2905.14s)]
*  or America would have the same firepower nuclear as Russia that's why it has to stay together that [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2911.38s)]
*  that acknowledgement was bought in blood right Donald Trump was mercilessly booed and mocked [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2917.78s)]
*  for suggesting that not by me years but by many many many people so first of all acknowledging [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2924.02s)]
*  that that acknowledgement was hard won and I'm glad to have it right now second of all what I [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2929.62s)]
*  would say is you know when the war in Ukraine started the Donbas region was not part of Ukraine [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2934.74s)]
*  it was an independent republic of Donetsk and Luhansk there was a civil war undergoing [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2942.1s)]
*  at that exact time and in fact the residents of Donetsk and the residents of Luhansk were blaming [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2949.54s)]
*  Putin for abandoning them and not invading and coming to protect them from the neo-nazi as they [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2956.18s)]
*  called it Ukrainian regime but that's not true only 10% hang on that's not true at the start of [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2961.22s)]
*  the war there was a civil war in the Donbas region only 10% of those polled in that region wanted to [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2966.2599999999998s)]
*  be part of Russia 10% 90% that was not true in 2014 and 2015 during the Maidan revolution that [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2972.8999999999996s)]
*  was true after Putin invaded I agree with you then that the war itself was very unifying in Ukraine [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2979.8599999999997s)]
*  but at the day that that war started there was a civil war going on there and that area was an [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2986.5s)]
*  independent republic two weeks into the war Putin laid down three conditions for immediately [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2991.38s)]
*  withdrawing troops from Ukraine number one Ukraine will not be part of NATO number two [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=2998.1800000000003s)]
*  the the area the Donbas those though that region that was under civil war would be remain independent [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3004.34s)]
*  right that was the second condition and the third condition that he laid out was that Crimea would [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3011.2200000000003s)]
*  remain part of Russia guess what the war is about to end along those three conditions but the people [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3015.86s)]
*  like me and Dave who pointed this out when Putin laid that down were called Russian stooges a [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3022.6600000000003s)]
*  million young men ago a million young men were still alive when we were saying all Putin is asking [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3029.06s)]
*  for is a ratification of the status quo and you won't give it to him and now all these people are [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3035.78s)]
*  that's not to say that the deaths are not at Putin's feet they are but I agree with Dave I think [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3041.54s)]
*  we did not do anything to prevent this totally preventable war okay I couldn't disagree more [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3046.74s)]
*  with that analysis but I appreciate the way you conveyed it uh check final word to you briefly if [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3052.98s)]
*  you don't mind yeah so I'm going to be consistent here we need to get to peace uh and Biden and [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3057.14s)]
*  Boris Johnson in this case did great damage to the cause of peace uh they pushed the Ukrainians [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3064.4199999999996s)]
*  further away from it when they could have had a pretty good peace offer way earlier now unfortunately [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3070.02s)]
*  they're going to get a bad peace offer and so it doesn't seem like there's a great way to avoid [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3075.3s)]
*  letting the Russians keep some portions of Ukraine that they've already taken I agree with Dave it's [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3081.14s)]
*  too impractical to try to take it back I would propose that uh that the deal is yes you get to [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3086.58s)]
*  keep that Russia but the rest of Ukraine gets to join NATO to be forever protected remember we took [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3093.14s)]
*  away their nukes with the promise that we would protect them forever now we've kind of failed on [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3099.46s)]
*  that promise but at least protect the rest and that would be a way to to do that I don't agree [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3104.26s)]
*  with uh getting out of NATO I think that's a terrible idea agree with peers but I do agree [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3109.46s)]
*  with all of you guys that uh Trump did a very good job of getting them to pay their bills in fact I [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3113.94s)]
*  think they should pay more than us because we're mainly defending them so don't ruin the alliance [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3118.42s)]
*  but make it fair and just yeah I agree just on that NATO point Pete Hegseth the defense secretary [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3123.78s)]
*  the United States does not believe he says that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3129.38s)]
*  for negotiated settlement and if you take the logic of the pro-putin members of this panel joke if [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3134.1s)]
*  you take the logic of the more more more we we believe him uh elements um then if the reason why [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3139.7000000000003s)]
*  he went to war was to stop NATO encroachment the last thing he'll do in a peace deal is allow Ukraine [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3146.82s)]
*  to become a full paid up member of NATO is my with my assessment anyway uh great panel thank [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3151.78s)]
*  you all very much but we have to have compromise we do God bless you thanks peers yeah good to see [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3157.14s)]
*  you guys thank you very much thank you we're on joined in the studio now by the crown prince of [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3161.7799999999997s)]
*  Iran Reza Pazlavi who says this is a moment for a reset in the middle east great to see you again [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3166.18s)]
*  good to see you again so much has happened I mean every time I see you so much has happened but [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3172.18s)]
*  um what do you make of where we are in the middle east right now [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3176.42s)]
*  in a nutshell I don't think there's any moment after 46 years that we see the Iranian regime as [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3181.22s)]
*  its weakest and uh in proportion to that the Iranian people as resolved and determined than [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3186.82s)]
*  ever before the loss of proxies and the fall of the Bashar regime in Syria has been a severe blow [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3194.7400000000002s)]
*  to the regime means of implementing its uh sort of uh beyond its border intervention and fomenting [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3205.46s)]
*  conflict and so therefore they really have their backs to the wall right now [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3215.86s)]
*  the speed that Assad was driven out of Syria in the end was very dramatic these things often can [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3220.98s)]
*  be like that is there any real expectation that there could be a similar uprising in Iran for [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3226.1s)]
*  example that the people look at what happened in Syria and think yeah we can do that and and it [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3232.34s)]
*  would it be achievable you know Pierce the first time that we met I think you were still with CNN [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3237.78s)]
*  we had the first interview and throughout the years I think you can also remember that while we [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3242.34s)]
*  had several generation of protests in Iran throughout the years and the decades the [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3248.42s)]
*  frequency of them have become much more particularly since the mass revolution and the fact that [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3254.58s)]
*  Iranians are more than ever ready to go beyond this regime the cries on the streets the protests [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3259.46s)]
*  of death to the dictator death to the Islamic regime are louder than ever including the last [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3264.5s)]
*  few days which was around the anniversary the 46th anniversary of the revolution what's however [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3269.54s)]
*  important for all of us to realize is that I believe there's an alignment of the stars in [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3275.3s)]
*  terms of a golden opportunity to put an end to the very root of the crisis all over which is the [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3279.06s)]
*  regime itself the epicenter has always been Tehran I said in the way that the regime is weak and the [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3284.9s)]
*  people are ready the important thing is for some governments who are behind the curve to catch up [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3291.46s)]
*  to that why do I say this is important because as I'm sure everybody wants to avoid conflict or [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3296.82s)]
*  escalation of conflict and the only way to avoid conflict particularly if diplomacy has failed [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3303.78s)]
*  to achieve what was a false premise of behavior change and it has to be reset as you said of [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3309.78s)]
*  policy the best way to address the issue so that we don't lead directly from failed diplomacy to [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3316.42s)]
*  conflict and aggression is to provide a third alternative which is empowering the Iranian people [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3323.46s)]
*  this time so therefore a policy of maximum pressure that so far has been implemented in the [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3328.98s)]
*  regime has to be coupled with a policy of maximum support thereby enabling the Iranian people to [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3334.1s)]
*  ultimately achieve that goal of liberation put an end to this regime and instead of what we had as a [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3340.18s)]
*  major source of instability instead have an element that brings stability and peace which is [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3345.94s)]
*  conducive to realistic prospect of permanent solutions shall we say about the Israeli-Palestinian [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3351.94s)]
*  issue that cannot be achieved as long as this regime is there sabotaging every effort right so [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3357.86s)]
*  I mean the belief is that Iran's tentacles extend to Hezbollah the Houthis Hamas and they've all been [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3362.18s)]
*  destabilized to a degree but possibly the ideology behind it has not been and certainly in Gaza for [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3371.46s)]
*  example the US intelligence believe that perhaps you've killed a lot of Hamas terrorists but that [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3379.78s)]
*  the thinking that belies them actually may have been fueled by everything that's gone on there [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3386.7400000000002s)]
*  what do you think of that I would say that it's very hard to defeat an ideology by killing people [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3393.3s)]
*  what needs to eradicate an ideology is to give the people an alternative whereby they can escape [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3399.5400000000004s)]
*  regimes that try to dominate via ideology what is communism like we saw during the cold war in the [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3406.58s)]
*  soviet union or an Islamic theocracy that is trying to push its agenda of exporting an ideology [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3412.18s)]
*  of course at the expense of the population of the country from which they're using as a launching [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3418.42s)]
*  pad which serve as for Khomeini and his entire vision of exporting this ideology across the world [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3424.1s)]
*  the alternative is there because the ask of people today in Iran is the very same values [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3430.3399999999997s)]
*  that the free world enjoys and aspired by human rights democracy no discrimination of any form [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3437.7s)]
*  and that's exactly what Iranian people want against the DNA of a regime that cannot co-exist in the [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3446.66s)]
*  world based on that conflict of values which is why you cannot ever achieve a reasonable outcome [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3452.98s)]
*  by compromising with them that's why you cannot trust them that's why they will never agree to it [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3458.66s)]
*  even as as late of president trump trying to still offer yet another opportunity for them to [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3463.94s)]
*  complete how many rejects it not because it's irrational but because he can afford to agree to [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3470.3399999999997s)]
*  it and these are why we what do you think of president trump's come up with this idea that [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3475.8599999999997s)]
*  the palestinians should all be taken in by egypt and jordan two million people it's been met with [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3480.98s)]
*  huge uh kickback from the palestinians and from other arab countries in the region [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3487.7s)]
*  but as with many things that trump says you know maybe he's trying to create a debate here about [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3494.02s)]
*  what should actually happen because most of gaza has been flattened i mean what happens to these [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3498.4199999999996s)]
*  people do you think well first of all my heart goes out to the victims of all of these conflicts [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3502.58s)]
*  but we have to think of what is the permanent and only solution again i think that when you have a [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3508.98s)]
*  regime in iran that is an element of instability that is fomenting aggression supports terrorism [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3514.26s)]
*  how could you possibly in that atmosphere talk about legitimate possible lasting peace i think [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3521.6200000000003s)]
*  the key element to change the entire situation in the middle east and beyond is the impact that the [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3528.26s)]
*  regime has if the regime is no longer there and instead you have a government that first of all [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3534.9s)]
*  is representative of the people of iran's aspiration people who want peace who don't [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3540.26s)]
*  have any hostility or aggression towards israel or the arabs or any ethnicity or any religion [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3544.6600000000003s)]
*  instead we want to be contributors to stabilizing our region that's where finally we can see it [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3551.38s)]
*  but how do you remove the ayatollah in that scenario well again i think that the formula [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3558.1000000000004s)]
*  that we have always prescribed to you familiar with it you remember me saying it all along is that [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3563.3s)]
*  the iranian people are the ultimate agent of change they are your true boots on the ground you [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3568.34s)]
*  would see a similar scenario to what we saw in in syria well i mean i think iran is really unique [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3573.38s)]
*  in terms of we cannot draw a parallel to let's say iraq or afghanistan or syria as we said that it [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3578.9s)]
*  has been in terms of the people themselves within the country rising up yes against the regime well [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3584.5s)]
*  that's what the people of iran have been trying to do except that they've been alone in this fight [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3591.54s)]
*  to have received no support whatsoever from the outside world and the reason i say this is because [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3595.7s)]
*  successful campaign of change of regimes in a non-violent way without involving foreign [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3600.66s)]
*  intervention or military occupation or what have you could not have been achieved all by itself [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3609.62s)]
*  without some tacit support from the free world example solidarity movement in in poland at the [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3615.7799999999997s)]
*  end of the cold war or the support for nelson mandela and the anc to put an end to apartheid [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3622.42s)]
*  in south africa in the same spirit i think that empowerment means that we're giving the people a [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3628.02s)]
*  real chance to stand up to a regime they need to be fortified they need to be engaged with and i [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3633.7000000000003s)]
*  think the shift that i'm talking about in policy and a reset is that instead of talking about [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3640.02s)]
*  appeasement instead of talking about expecting a behavior change and they have been given ample [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3644.9s)]
*  chance to come clean and they haven't isn't it time for once to give the iranian people a chance [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3650.34s)]
*  to really be the agent of of change and trust the running people in the fact that they are [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3654.7400000000002s)]
*  sparked to the very same principle that the free world is governed by against the regime doesn't [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3660.1000000000004s)]
*  completely neglecting these rights to begin with it's a win-win for all it's really a situation [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3666.6600000000003s)]
*  that will be a relief to our immediate neighbors it will be an element that addresses the security [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3672.42s)]
*  concerns of many countries it eliminates the existential threat to israel and most importantly [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3679.06s)]
*  and i'm sure donald trump as a businessman will appreciate this is good for business too you have [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3685.94s)]
*  to have a stable environment in order to have economic opportunities what do you mean what is [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3690.66s)]
*  the one thing you would like president trump to do right now to help facilitate this well one thing [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3694.82s)]
*  we can learn from his first mandate and the maximum pressure campaign was certainly effective but this [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3700.66s)]
*  is sufficient for what it is that we are trying to achieve that's why i propose that parallel [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3705.78s)]
*  to the maximum pressure campaign and i hope europe will join in some elements that could be added [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3710.1000000000004s)]
*  more pressure for instance the listing of the irgc as a terrorist organization which is yet to be [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3715.46s)]
*  implemented by western governments and couple this with a campaign of maximum support energizing [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3721.1400000000003s)]
*  invigorating the people on the streets in iran so they can better organize and mobilize themselves [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3728.02s)]
*  in the campaign of civil disobedience perhaps the final coup de grâce against the regime will be [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3733.06s)]
*  labor strikes that paralyzes the regime and forces an implosion at the same time this will be a cause [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3738.74s)]
*  for more defections from the regime we already have seen sign of it i've already had elements [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3744.82s)]
*  who until yesterday believed in again maybe reform is still plausible but that idea has been that [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3750.02s)]
*  narrative has changed today people know that the solution is to get out of this regime but have a [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3756.1s)]
*  policy that also prepares the ground for post-regime in terms of the transition period [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3761.06s)]
*  and how this defection makes most people who don't have their hands sold with the blood of [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3766.58s)]
*  the running people survive regime change and have a hope for the future so they're not stuck in no [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3770.66s)]
*  man's land or forced to stay with the regime to the bitter end that's part of the solution to [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3775.86s)]
*  minimize the cost to the nation to achieve the other the goals that they have for that we really [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3780.5s)]
*  need to have solidarity from the outside world krampus blobby it's always good to catch up with [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rdukOvjLCY&t=3785.46s)]
