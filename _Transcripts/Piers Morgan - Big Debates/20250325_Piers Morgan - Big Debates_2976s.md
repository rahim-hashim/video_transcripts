Video Description: Political violence is something the vast majority will quickly condemn; in public at least. But Americans in particular know how quickly anger can turn into action. Businessman and Donald Trump mega-donor Elon Musk now finds himself the focus of a furious campaign of left-wing hatred. There have been global protests against his Tesla dealerships, which are of course legal, but there has also been a cavalcade of arson and vandalism attacks, which are decidedly not. The question is, do these attacks count as terrorism? 

For a passionate debate on this very question, Piers Morgan brings together social commentator and Elon Musk’s ‘clear thinker’ Kaizen Asiedu, author of User Magazine Taylor Lorenz, pastor and radio host Bishop Talbert Swan and co-founder of ‘The Young Turks’ Cenk Uygur for their takes as the FBI vows to crack down on these atrocities.

# 'There Will Be CIVIL WAR!” Tesla Under Attack!
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA)
*  This is domestic terrorism. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=0.0s)]
*  These are real enemies. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Like I think they actually want to kill me. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=7.48s)]
*  When you can literally murder people and not be labeled as a domestic terrorism, how is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=10.84s)]
*  it that burning some cars or vandalizing the windshields makes you a domestic terrorist? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=15.84s)]
*  Fire bombing of Tesla's is unbelievably dumb. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=21.0s)]
*  It's so dumb I originally thought it was like a false flag operation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  You shouldn't refer to past instances where we failed to identify terrorism as terrorism [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=28.08s)]
*  as a reason to not call this terrorism. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=33.36s)]
*  Protesting because Elon is gutting our federal government we have a complete oligarchy running [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=35.4s)]
*  this country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=39.8s)]
*  Can I say hypocrisy? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=40.8s)]
*  The so-called Tesla takedown movement is going global with 500 demonstrations planned at [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=42.8s)]
*  showrooms across the world. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=49.12s)]
*  So far the campaign against Elon Musk Company has taken the form of demonstrations, calls [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=51.099999999999994s)]
*  for a boycott and the dumping of stock. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  There have also been outbreaks of vandalism with Tesla's being damaged and dealerships [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=57.48s)]
*  fired bombed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=61.92s)]
*  Some websites meanwhile are even doxing anyone who owns a Tesla. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=63.12s)]
*  At the weekend, Pam Bondi appeared on Fox to issue this start warning. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=66.4s)]
*  Not isolated incidents as you know and these aren't vandals. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=71.88s)]
*  These are Molotov cocktails. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=75.52s)]
*  That could be a weapon of mass destruction that they're throwing in Tesla dealerships. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=76.52s)]
*  That they're lighting these Tesla charging stations on fire that are in residential [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=82.84s)]
*  neighborhoods. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=88.56s)]
*  I mean it could cause tremendous damages and people need to know that three people in custody [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=89.56s)]
*  right now they will receive severe and swift consequences and they are facing up to 20 [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=94.76s)]
*  years in prison. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=101.12s)]
*  We are not negotiating these. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=102.5s)]
*  We are not coming off these charges. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=104.18s)]
*  We are looking at everything especially if this is a concerted effort. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  This is domestic terrorism. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=110.0s)]
*  Well the official Tesla takeover action group say taking down Elon Musk is the only way [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=111.64s)]
*  to save democracy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=115.72s)]
*  Critics claim this could be BLM mark 2. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=117.28s)]
*  This is not stop now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=119.24s)]
*  Here's a debate with the social commentator Kaizen Asiyaju who Elon Musk has recommended [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=120.24s)]
*  to his millions of followers as a clear thinker. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=125.44s)]
*  The author of user magazine Taylor Lorenz. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=128.2s)]
*  The pastor and radio host Bishop Talbot Swan. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=130.64s)]
*  I'm going to be joined by the founder and CEO of the Young Turks, Cenk Yuga in a moment. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=133.48s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  Welcome to all of you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  Let me start with you if I may Kaizen. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  It seems to me that people are chucking Molotov cocktails at car lots full of Teslas without [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  any knowledge of who might be in the cars or who might be manning the stations. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=149.96s)]
*  That is an act of domestic terrorism isn't it? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  Clearly. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean terrorism is defined as the systemic use of terror to accomplish a political end. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  So this is quite literally terrorism. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=164.72s)]
*  Now the entire movement isn't terrorism but absolutely someone taking a Molotov cocktail [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=167.04s)]
*  to throw at the private property of other middle class citizens is not only terrorism [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=172.52s)]
*  it's just ineffective. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=177.28s)]
*  So I think there are people who maybe feel sympathetic to where that person is coming [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=178.96s)]
*  from but for those people I would ask well what is this actually accomplishing at the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=183.44s)]
*  end of the day? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=187.72s)]
*  How does this move us forward? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=188.72s)]
*  Right Bishop Talbot what's your response to that? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=190.72s)]
*  Well you know I think that language matters and it's important. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=193.8s)]
*  I think anyone who is conducting such acts is certainly conducting a criminal act that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  should definitely be checked and they should be prosecuted if found responsible. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=203.84s)]
*  But what I see happening in America as it has always happened is when poor people, when [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  marginalized people, when it's Black Lives Matter protesters, when it's non-white immigrants [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  they get the label of terrorist. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=221.76s)]
*  However the label of frustrated citizens gets applied when violent white men shoot up churches [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=224.8s)]
*  or synagogues or schools or when they storm the Capitol and violently damage the building, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=232.76s)]
*  hurt police officers, defecate on the premises and try to take over the government. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=242.0s)]
*  And so I'm not against people criticizing these acts of criminal activity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=248.6s)]
*  What I am against is the blatant double standard by law enforcement coming out from the gate [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=255.2s)]
*  without doing an investigation or anything and calling it domestic terrorism from the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=261.36s)]
*  very gate. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=268.56s)]
*  They didn't call what Timothy McVeigh did domestic terrorism. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=269.56s)]
*  They didn't call what Dylann Roof did when he murdered nine people in a church domestic [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=273.16s)]
*  terrorism. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  When Robert Bowers was the mass murderer at the Tree of Life Synagogue they didn't call [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=279.64000000000004s)]
*  him a domestic terrorist. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  So when you can literally murder people and not be labeled as a domestic terrorism how [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  is it that burning some cars or vandalizing the windshields makes you a domestic terrorist? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=291.0s)]
*  Well I mean I'll come to Taylor. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=296.16s)]
*  I would personally categorize all those things you just said as acts of domestic terrorism [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=297.68s)]
*  for what it's worth and I think I did at the time. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=302.44s)]
*  Taylor, I mean look on a wider point here about Elon Musk, he was the liberal darling. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=305.32s)]
*  People like you would have, I don't know, I'm guessing, would have been drooling over [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=311.76s)]
*  Musk, a genius, bestriding the world like a liberal colossus, putting all the world [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=314.79999999999995s)]
*  to rights with his green energy, his SpaceX and so on. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=321.0s)]
*  Now he's the most hated man in the liberal world, even more hated than Donald Trump to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=325.52s)]
*  liberals. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=331.12s)]
*  What has happened here? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well first I just want to clarify that I am absolutely not a liberal. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=339.04s)]
*  How would you categorize yourself? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=340.04s)]
*  Independent, politically independent. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=341.92s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=344.52000000000004s)]
*  You're not to the right though are you? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean I think I agree with the right on certain issues. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=348.12s)]
*  I mean when they talk about free speech I wish they would live up to those ideals but [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=351.04s)]
*  I certainly believe in limited government intervention and speech. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=354.6s)]
*  To get back to your question, I think it's interesting because he must really use Tesla [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=359.96s)]
*  to appeal to this liberal audience. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=365.12s)]
*  As you mentioned, he was a liberal darling. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=367.12s)]
*  Obama loved him. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  This is what got him all of his praise and I think a lot of people now, liberal Tesla [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  owners especially, feel betrayed. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=375.8s)]
*  I mean I live in LA and it's hard to see a Tesla without one of those bumper stickers. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=377.48s)]
*  I bought this before Elon went crazy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=381.36s)]
*  And I think it speaks to Elon's political pivot as well. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=383.6s)]
*  Because let's not forget, just a couple years ago, Elon was tweeting, I believe in 2018 [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=386.44s)]
*  or 2019, you know, if you don't support LGBTQ people, don't buy a Tesla. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=390.32s)]
*  He was leaning into that liberal ideology. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=395.8s)]
*  Did you support him then? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  Did you like him then? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean I'm not a huge fan of any billionaire to be honest and Elon Musk has been a billionaire [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  for years but I do think it's notable how his billionaire status has changed with the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=407.56s)]
*  rise of Tesla and that's what this movement is about. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=412.16s)]
*  Back in 2011, 2012, Elon Musk only had only $2 billion, massive amount of money, right? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=415.04s)]
*  But nothing compared to the over $400 billion that he amassed back in December 2024. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=422.24s)]
*  That was his current net worth. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  So I think it speaks to his political power, right? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=430.36s)]
*  And the checks and balances. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=432.32000000000005s)]
*  And the reason you're seeing people throw these Molotov cocktails, which I believe is [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=433.92s)]
*  not remotely anything that's happening in sort of any widespread fashion, but it's because [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=437.36s)]
*  they feel like they have no accountability. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=442.12s)]
*  They feel like they can't work within the system so they're going to work outside the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=443.76000000000005s)]
*  system to get some sense of justice so that this billionaire can't just run rampant, dismantling [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=446.6s)]
*  our government with impunity. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=452.36s)]
*  But here's the deal, look, he went on Joe Rogan a couple of weeks ago and he said this. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=454.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, it's pretty stressful actually. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  These are real enemies. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=463.92s)]
*  I think they actually want to kill me. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=470.0s)]
*  And the reason I know, well, they say so online. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=473.12s)]
*  You know, there's like Reddit forums where they don't just want to kill me, they want [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=476.32s)]
*  to desecrate my corpse. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=481.04s)]
*  Don't just want to kill him, say they don't want to desecrate his corpse. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=482.24s)]
*  That's how he feels. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=487.0s)]
*  Welcome to the internet. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=488.0s)]
*  I read stuff like that about myself all day. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=489.0s)]
*  I mean, it's reality. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=491.24s)]
*  Yes, it's reality. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=492.24s)]
*  People want to kill you and desecrate your corpse? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=493.24s)]
*  I read that every single day. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=497.4s)]
*  Not just that horrible graphic threats. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=499.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, that's the internet. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=502.16s)]
*  And if you challenge power, that is what you are going to be faced with every day, especially [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=503.36s)]
*  if you're a woman or a marginalized person. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=507.28s)]
*  And you know, I don't like it, but that is the reality. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=509.76s)]
*  Now it's good to see that Elon is at least acknowledging that, you know, people are angry [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=513.56s)]
*  with him. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=518.62s)]
*  That's something that we haven't seen before. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=519.62s)]
*  He normally just rants and goes into denialism and sort of refuses to even acknowledge the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=521.16s)]

*  Prosperity, US national debt, is at crisis levels. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=544.12s)]
*  Inflation has made life more expensive for everybody. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=547.36s)]
*  And the stock market is precarious. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=549.88s)]
*  It's enough to make anyone's financial future feel grim. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=551.52s)]
*  So what is the solution? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=554.8000000000001s)]

*  265532. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=617.04s)]
*  All the details are in the description. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=619.52s)]
*  Now on with the show. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=621.4s)]
*  Okay, um, I mean, I find it fascinating that Musk has gone on this big Damascene conversion [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=624.76s)]
*  to Trump. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=634.12s)]
*  But a lot of his personal positions haven't changed. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=635.12s)]
*  It's not like he's become a conservative Republican in terms of the way he views the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=638.44s)]
*  world. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=644.6s)]
*  Um, I don't think that's happened at all. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=645.6s)]
*  He's got the same views that he had about pretty much all of the social issues out there, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=648.72s)]
*  except he now backs Trump full on. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=655.12s)]
*  But in terms of, well, you're shaking your head, Taylor, but in terms of his view of [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=659.0s)]
*  the gay community, in terms of his views of green energy, in terms of his views of climate [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=662.96s)]
*  change, all these things. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=667.84s)]
*  But he hasn't changed his mind about those things, has he? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=668.84s)]
*  Yes he has. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=673.5600000000001s)]
*  Yes he radically has changed his mind towards his views on the gay community. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=674.5600000000001s)]
*  About which one of those things? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=677.0s)]
*  Green energy? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=678.2800000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=679.2800000000001s)]
*  LGBTQ community? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=680.2800000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=681.2800000000001s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=682.2800000000001s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=683.2800000000001s)]
*  He went from supporting LGBTQ DEI initiatives at Tesla to now trying to dismantle DEI and [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=685.0400000000001s)]
*  disown his trans daughter. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=691.6s)]
*  So he has radically changed his views. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=693.5s)]
*  He started back in 2021. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=695.72s)]
*  Forging out with his trans daughter doesn't mean he's transphobic, does it? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=697.2s)]
*  He has absolutely made, even the daughter aside, he has made it very clear where he [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=701.6s)]
*  stands on trans. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=707.12s)]
*  He has promoted terrible, horrible, bigoted conspiracy theories about trans people. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=708.12s)]
*  Like what? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=712.08s)]
*  Like what? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=713.08s)]
*  Like the false conspiracy theory that, you know, trans people are groomers and also that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=714.08s)]
*  there were, you know, litter boxes in Texas schools for kids that identify as animals. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=720.1600000000001s)]
*  Of course, that was completely debunked, completely false. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=724.96s)]
*  He is constantly talking about the woke mind virus in relation to trans people. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=728.12s)]
*  He yeah, I mean, his views have completely evolved. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  He wasn't saying any of that back in the 2010s. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=735.52s)]
*  He was again arguing that you shouldn't buy, if you don't like LGBTQ rights, you shouldn't [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=738.2800000000001s)]
*  buy a Tesla. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=742.76s)]
*  That's a massive departure and a massive evolution. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=743.76s)]
*  And by the way, he's admitted this evolution, right? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=747.36s)]
*  This is somebody that came out as conservative, that was talking about, you know, in 2022 [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=749.84s)]
*  when he announced that he was voting Republican, was talking about how, you know, he's evolved [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=755.32s)]
*  his political beliefs. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=759.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=760.4s)]
*  We've been joined by Cenk Uygur. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=761.4s)]
*  Cenk, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=762.88s)]
*  Really appreciate you coming on. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=765.6800000000001s)]
*  You're a last minute call up, but no less important than you normally are. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=767.4s)]
*  Always a valued member of our punditry team. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=771.36s)]
*  Let's just ask you, Cenk, where you sit on this idea that the firebombing of Teslas constitutes [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=776.2s)]
*  domestic terrorism. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=781.9200000000001s)]
*  Do you think it does? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=782.9200000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=785.12s)]
*  So let's be clear about a couple of things. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=786.12s)]
*  First of all, the firebombing of Teslas is unbelievably dumb. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=788.84s)]
*  It's so dumb that it makes like it, I originally thought it was like a false flag operation. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=794.1600000000001s)]
*  Like who would be so stupid as to gift wrap this kind of action for Elon Musk and Donald [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=799.24s)]
*  Trump? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=805.28s)]
*  It's like if I didn't know that it wasn't Trump and right wingers, et cetera. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=806.28s)]
*  Anyway, I don't even want to get into how ridiculously stupid it is. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=812.0s)]
*  So radical left cut the crap out and it doesn't apply to everyone on the far left. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=816.6s)]
*  It just applies to these idiots who did it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=820.96s)]
*  Now in terms of calling it terrorism, the word is disgusting. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=822.64s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=826.16s)]
*  We should never use it again. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=827.16s)]
*  All it is is hypocrisy on top of hypocrisy. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=828.6800000000001s)]
*  So Hamas's terrorism is terrorism. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=830.96s)]
*  Israel does 50 times worse terrorism, not terrorism. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=833.84s)]
*  So Tykes Foundation is attacked. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=837.12s)]
*  So that's George Soros's foundation. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=839.84s)]
*  Not terrorism. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=842.6s)]
*  That's a physical violent attack against human beings, not terrorism. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=843.6s)]
*  An attack on cars, terrorism, right? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=847.4s)]
*  Pipe bombs from a Trump supporter who does not represent all Trump supporters like these [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=850.48s)]
*  guys don't represent all the left, but he does pipe bombs. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=855.88s)]
*  So all the Trump's political opponents, not terrorism. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=858.8000000000001s)]
*  Dylan Roof says, here's why I'm doing it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=861.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm a political terrorist. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=863.8399999999999s)]
*  I want to kill black people and start a race war, not terrorism. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=865.72s)]
*  We get him Burger King. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=869.04s)]
*  But you attack cars, terrorism. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=870.52s)]
*  Now the use of the word domestic terrorism is going to divide us all. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=872.6s)]
*  It's going to make us hate each other and turn inward. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=876.72s)]
*  Last time we used verbiage like this, we attacked Iraq. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=880.04s)]
*  This time we're attacking ourselves. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=882.76s)]
*  The neocons are back. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=884.52s)]
*  But if you're firebombing things with Molotov cocktails that create gigantic furnaces and [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=886.34s)]
*  you're doing it for political reasons, is that not a form of terrorism? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=892.9s)]
*  And if it happens on American soil, is that not then just automatically domestic terrorism? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=896.9s)]
*  You're completely right that many other things that have happened have been deliberately [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=903.3000000000001s)]
*  not labeled that for political reasons by the Republicans. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=908.14s)]
*  But it seems to me that by the yardstick of what domestic terrorism constitutes, you know, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=912.86s)]
*  acting for political reasons in a very violent manner that imperils life, isn't that domestic [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=918.0200000000001s)]
*  terrorism? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=924.22s)]
*  Piers, can we go on to ask the question? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=925.22s)]
*  Kyrsten, I'll bring you in after Jake responds to what I just said. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=927.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Piers, this is a super dangerous throat. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=930.94s)]
*  And I have to tell you, I've been guilty of it too. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=933.1800000000001s)]
*  So look, I've used the word domestic terrorism in relates to countless right-wing attacks. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=935.74s)]
*  The El Paso attack that said, I'm trying to murder Latinos. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=941.62s)]
*  Dylann Roof saying, I'm trying to murder black people. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=944.54s)]
*  I'm trying to start race wars, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=946.78s)]
*  And I've called that way, if we're going to call it terrorism, let's be consistent, et [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=949.62s)]
*  cetera. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=952.82s)]
*  Now, those are never, ever, ever called terrorism. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=953.82s)]
*  And if a right-winger ever does anything, it's never, ever, ever called terrorism. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=954.82s)]
*  If Israel does it, it's never called terrorism. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=958.62s)]
*  So I hate the word. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=960.7s)]
*  It's a disgusting, politically loaded word. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=961.7s)]
*  But much more importantly, even more important than all of that is, if we start calling each [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=964.0600000000001s)]
*  other terrorists, the left and the right, there's going to be no end to it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=969.18s)]
*  And it's going to lead to a civil war. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=972.38s)]
*  And the other thing that you have to understand is this is a way to shut down all speech. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=974.4599999999999s)]
*  Oh, now, okay, since two or three idiots did something violent, who, by the way, who they [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=978.4599999999999s)]
*  should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=983.9399999999999s)]
*  There's very significant crimes here. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=986.62s)]
*  Arson, assault, battery trespassing, a thousand crimes you can charge them with. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=988.78s)]
*  But we start calling each other terrorists and no one will have any free speech left, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=992.8199999999999s)]
*  I guarantee it. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=996.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, there's certainly an element of that. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=997.5400000000001s)]
*  Kajdan, I'll bring you back in. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=998.74s)]
*  I mean, I think there's been a lot of hypocrisy on both sides about this, actually. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=999.74s)]
*  People use terminology when it suits them to suit their own side. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1004.1s)]
*  There's no question of that. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1007.38s)]
*  I've seen it happen on both sides. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1008.38s)]
*  But I do think Czech's got a point there. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1010.62s)]
*  There is a slippery slope, isn't there, if everything starts being labeled domestic terrorism? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1012.3000000000001s)]
*  Because actually, the vast majority of the Tesla protesters, and I suspect this will [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1016.9000000000001s)]
*  be the case when we see the demonstrations, if they're exercising their democratic right [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1020.98s)]
*  to peacefully protest, that's a fundamental bedrock of American society. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1025.74s)]
*  Absolutely, and we should protect their right to protest. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1031.46s)]
*  But I want to respond to something that Bishop said and what Cenk said by implication. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1034.14s)]
*  The fact that there are double standards being applied does not mean that we should not apply [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1038.66s)]
*  the standard. It just means that we need to apply the standard consistently. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1042.42s)]
*  So, again, people are saying yes, it's terrorism, no, it's terrorism. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1045.66s)]
*  The first question we should start with is what is the definition of terrorism? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1048.66s)]
*  Terrorism is a systematic use of terror to accomplish a political end. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1052.6599999999999s)]
*  If someone is lighting a Molotov cocktail, I don't care if they're white, black, brown, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1057.06s)]
*  or something in between. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1062.34s)]
*  That is an act of terrorism. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1063.6999999999998s)]
*  Now, do they represent a fringe of the anti-Elon, anti-Tesla movement? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1065.3799999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1069.9799999999998s)]
*  And we don't need to paint everyone with the same brush. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1070.78s)]
*  But we shouldn't refer to past instances where we failed to identify terrorism as terrorism [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1073.1s)]
*  as a reason to not call this terrorism because we don't like the word. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1078.62s)]
*  So, this is what I see on both the right and the left. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1082.26s)]
*  We have people pointing the finger at inconsistencies in the other camp to justify inconsistencies [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1085.02s)]
*  in their own camp. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1090.78s)]
*  And if we continue to do that, no one will ever make progress. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1091.98s)]
*  I also see a lot of cherry picking about certain ideals that Elon might espouse or certain [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1095.34s)]
*  things about his character, like, for example, the fact that he's a billionaire. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1100.14s)]
*  Kamala Harris had 83 billionaires support her in the 2024 election. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1103.94s)]
*  Donald Trump had 52 billionaires support him in the 2024 election. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1108.46s)]
*  So, people saying billionaires, this is like a curse word that's being used conveniently [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1112.74s)]
*  while ignoring the fact that there are billionaires on both sides and more billionaires on the [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1117.1000000000001s)]
*  Democratic side traditionally. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1120.94s)]
*  Now, to your point about LGBTQ rights and all of that, we should keep in mind that the [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1123.5s)]
*  position of the LGBTQ community has evolved over time. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1128.66s)]
*  And I think that's totally fine. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1133.14s)]
*  But I think early in the 2010s, no one was talking about biological males competing in [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1134.86s)]
*  sports of biological females. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1138.98s)]
*  So there's a question here of, did Elon evolve his views? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1140.94s)]
*  And also, did he leave a left or did the left leave him? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1144.46s)]
*  And besides all of this, I honestly think much of this is a distraction. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1148.5s)]
*  I think the thing that we actually need to be talking about as leaders right now is what [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1152.06s)]
*  is the pain that people are feeling? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1156.22s)]
*  Why are they expressing it this way? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1158.58s)]
*  How can we acknowledge that pain? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1160.8s)]
*  And how can we put constructive solutions in place as leaders here on this show? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1162.72s)]
*  And what can we ask the Trump administration to do to solve this wound? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1167.08s)]
*  Because I see people who are in pain. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1170.52s)]
*  I believe that the way that they're expressing it is not constructive. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1172.36s)]
*  But there's a legitimate pain that needs to be acknowledged. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1175.48s)]
*  And there's things that we can do to resolve that. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1177.6s)]
*  So whether you like Elon or not, I think is honestly a distraction. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1179.48s)]
*  We need to talk about the actual solutions that need to be introduced to solving the [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1182.56s)]
*  existential problems facing America, not whether Elon likes LGBT people or not. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1187.32s)]
*  American homeowners are at risk of a growing real estate scam, which the FBI calls house [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1193.8s)]
*  stealing. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1198.0s)]
*  This is how it works. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1199.0s)]
*  Criminals forge your signature on just one document, use a fake notary stamp, pay a small [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1200.36s)]
*  fee and then file it with your local recorder's office. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1204.72s)]
*  Just like that, your home title is transferred out of your name. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1208.2s)]
*  Scammers can then take out loans using your equity as collateral or even sell the property [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1212.28s)]
*  behind your back. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1216.76s)]
*  You won't even know it's happening until you start getting collection or foreclosure [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1218.04s)]
*  notices. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1221.96s)]
*  When was the last time you checked your home title? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1222.96s)]
*  I own a home in the United States and the answer for me is never until now. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1225.16s)]
*  That's why I trust home title lock. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1230.28s)]

*  because you know I certainly was happy to identify as a liberal a few years ago but [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1286.48s)]

*  you. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1304.04s)]
*  So I do think a lot of people, and Elon Musk is one of them, I think Joe Rogan was another [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1305.04s)]
*  one, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, there's a whole load of people who would have [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1309.52s)]
*  identified quite happily as liberals a few years ago who no longer feel comfortable doing [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1314.3600000000001s)]
*  so and have gravitated to Trump because they feel the progressive left went nuts. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1319.68s)]
*  Pierce, you know I think we can't ignore the basic hypocrisy. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1328.88s)]
*  That's not a Democrat versus a Republican thing. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1334.1200000000001s)]
*  It's not a left versus a right thing. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1337.16s)]
*  It is something that has happened throughout the annals of American history. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1339.4s)]
*  There were acts of terror that were not classified that way under administrations that were run [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1342.88s)]
*  by Democrats. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1349.24s)]
*  And so when you try to relegate everything that happened to the past, that's not an [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1351.54s)]
*  accurate assessment. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1357.28s)]
*  They called Black Lives Matter protesters terrorists. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1358.6399999999999s)]
*  They didn't call the murderer of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville a terrorist. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1362.52s)]
*  And you've got to be, I agree that you have to be consistent, but the same people that [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1368.0s)]
*  are crying over Teslas are the very people that are trying to erase Black history from [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1372.76s)]
*  the classrooms and ignoring centuries of racial terror, of anti-Black racial terror. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1377.36s)]
*  They're the ones who want to strip from the history books from our children the Tulsa [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1384.6s)]
*  massacre, the Atlanta massacre, the Chicago massacre, the Detroit massacre. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1390.48s)]
*  They want to relegate those to historical footnotes or completely get rid of them at [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1394.76s)]
*  all but then raise burned cars to a national crisis and call it domestic terrorism. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1399.48s)]
*  That's basic hypocrisy that is done in a white supremacist society that says what happens [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1406.06s)]
*  to Black people and brown people and marginalized people is not terrorism but what happens to [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1411.72s)]
*  it. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1417.08s)]
*  And I'm going to use that big barbaric term of billionaire. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1418.08s)]
*  What happens to this billionaire is. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1420.28s)]
*  I hear you and you make strong points. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1422.28s)]
*  I would say that one of the reasons why DEI became so unpopular was because many people [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1424.52s)]
*  believed it was being utilized in a way to imply that everyone who's white is a white [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1431.32s)]
*  supremacist unless they can prove otherwise. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1435.84s)]
*  And they felt the politicization of classrooms into thinking this was becoming a very insidious [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1438.36s)]
*  part of American society. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1443.8s)]
*  And you know that. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1445.9399999999998s)]
*  You're a smart guy. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1446.9399999999998s)]
*  And I just think that it's too easy to dismiss it as nobody cares about Black history or [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1447.9399999999998s)]
*  Black... [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1453.04s)]
*  Of course they do. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1454.04s)]
*  But at the same time, you know, I've got four kids. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1455.04s)]
*  Do they show that by erasing it? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1456.6s)]
*  Are you erasing it or are you just removing this presumption that everyone is a white [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1459.86s)]
*  supremacist who's white until they prove otherwise? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1465.08s)]
*  Okay, Kaisa, you come in. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1467.84s)]
*  You were saying... [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1469.04s)]
*  So if you say, Pierce, let me... [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1470.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1471.36s)]
*  So if you say, if you stand up and you say that any institution of higher learning or [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1472.36s)]
*  any school system that is teaching Black history, we're going to withhold federal funds from [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1479.08s)]
*  those instances. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1485.48s)]
*  We're going to fine HBCUs up to the amount of their endowments and then allocate those [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1486.48s)]
*  and give them to white families who have been so-called discriminated against. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1493.06s)]
*  And by the way, DEI, the biggest beneficiary of DEI were white women. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1498.4199999999998s)]
*  DEI included veterans. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1503.74s)]
*  DEI included LGBTQ. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1505.3799999999999s)]
*  But for the purpose of the far right, DEI was a code word for Black folks, which is [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1507.8999999999999s)]
*  what galvanized them against DEI in the first place. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1513.5s)]
*  It's what galvanized them against woke. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1516.46s)]
*  It's what galvanized them against CRT as well. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1518.44s)]
*  All right, let me bring in Kaisa, because you were shaking your head through a lot of [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1521.3s)]
*  what you were hearing there. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1524.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1526.1799999999998s)]
*  So the first thing I'd wonder is why are we talking about race at all? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1527.1799999999998s)]
*  First of all, the guy who threw the Molotov cocktail was white and he's being treated [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1530.22s)]
*  like a terrorist, not because of the color of his skin, but because of what he did. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1533.82s)]
*  If he was Black, I would say that's terrorism too. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1537.58s)]
*  So I thought we're here to talk about the Tesla vandalism and what is communicating [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1540.22s)]
*  about the needs of the American people. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1544.34s)]
*  So let's bring this back to that. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1546.34s)]
*  What's happening is that America is in decline. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1548.18s)]
*  We have nearly $37 trillion of debt. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1551.3s)]
*  We have a $2 trillion deficit. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1553.74s)]
*  We are spiraling into bankruptcy. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1555.7s)]
*  Someone needs to get a handle on that. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1558.38s)]
*  We've tried multiple times over the last 25 years across administrations to bring efficiency [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1560.3400000000001s)]
*  to the government. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1565.18s)]
*  With the exception of Bill Clinton, who saved maybe $130 billion, it's been abject failures. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1566.3400000000001s)]
*  In 2011, Obama had Biden staff a committee to try to save billions of dollars when we [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1571.54s)]
*  actually need to save trillions and they failed. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1577.62s)]
*  So now a new approach is being tried. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1580.3799999999999s)]
*  It's bringing in someone who has a proven track record of making efficient organizations [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1582.76s)]
*  in Elon Musk. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1587.02s)]
*  So that's a thesis for why he's involved in government right now. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1588.36s)]
*  There's many people who don't like that. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1591.6999999999998s)]
*  I totally understand why. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1593.3s)]
*  The idea of an unelected billionaire is very, it's anathema to a lot of people. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1595.26s)]
*  I get that. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1601.54s)]
*  But my question for a lot of Tesla protesters is what is your alternative solution for [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1602.54s)]
*  resolving this incoming debt crisis? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1607.3s)]
*  What is your alternative solution for getting America to a place where middle class people [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1610.3s)]
*  can afford homes? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1615.74s)]
*  One in five millennials, my generation, think they will never be able to afford a home. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1617.3s)]
*  So hold on, I'm not done yet, Taylor. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1622.06s)]
*  When I am done, then you can speak. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1624.1s)]
*  But please let me finish my point for now. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1625.7s)]
*  So Bishop Swan, I very much care about black people as a black person myself. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1627.7s)]
*  I think there's a massive distortion of what the Trump administration is doing with regard [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1632.1s)]
*  to race. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1636.18s)]
*  But this is not a conversation about race, because if we enter an inflationary debt [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1637.18s)]
*  spiral, whether you're black, brown, yellow, anything in between, we are all going to be [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1641.5800000000002s)]
*  in a bad situation. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1646.66s)]
*  So there's people on the left who are saying they don't like that Elon cut 62,000 federal [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1648.0600000000002s)]
*  jobs. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1652.8200000000002s)]
*  I totally understand that. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1653.8200000000002s)]
*  But the question is, how do you get efficient government without cutting jobs? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1654.8200000000002s)]
*  How do you get efficient government without reducing costs? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1661.0800000000002s)]
*  So I don't know why we're talking about race. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1664.94s)]
*  I don't know why we're talking about these issues right now. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1667.06s)]
*  We need to zoom out and talk about what's important and affects us all, irrespective [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1669.58s)]
*  of race or gender identity. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1674.46s)]
*  So when when an administration comes into office and immediately signs executive orders [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1677.54s)]
*  abolishing 60 years of civil rights gangs off from the gate, how can you say that has [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1685.4s)]
*  nothing at all to do with race? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1694.36s)]
*  When they come in off the gate and they start and they start getting rid of they start [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1696.8799999999999s)]
*  abolishing black history and threatening educational institutions that teach black [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1702.1599999999999s)]
*  history, how do you say that is not about race when they come in off the gate and two [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1708.6799999999998s)]
*  people that they fire from the Joint Chiefs of Staff is a woman and a black man? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1714.36s)]
*  How do you say that's not about race when they come in and they start talking about [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1719.04s)]
*  everything is going to be based on meritocracy and then just about everybody they hire in [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1722.84s)]
*  their administration is unqualified for the positions that they hold and they're all white [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1728.6000000000001s)]
*  men. How do you say that's not about race? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1733.8s)]
*  I agree with you that the people are in pain and the people that are hurting. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1736.16s)]
*  But I suggest to you that the public response to Elon Musk, to Tesla is not random. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1739.32s)]
*  It's a reaction to real harm. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1745.24s)]
*  Workers losing health care, civil rights rollback, DEI elimination. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1747.6000000000001s)]
*  Educational whitewashing. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1752.8s)]
*  And so when justice is denied, people don't remain silent. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1754.32s)]
*  They resist. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1758.56s)]
*  It means they want to be heard. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1759.84s)]
*  MLK said the riot is the language of the unheard. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1761.92s)]
*  As you were talking, I'm happy to answer that. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1766.68s)]
*  Hang on one second. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1768.68s)]
*  Hang on. As you were talking there, Bishop told us one. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1770.08s)]
*  I just want to know if you're even aware of this. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1772.88s)]
*  But as you were coming into this debate, you had a few hours ago today, you posted a [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1775.52s)]
*  clip that was doing the rounds on the Internet of apparently JD Vance [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1782.72s)]
*  criticizing Elon Musk. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1786.88s)]
*  And I'm going to play a little bit of it now. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1789.1200000000001s)]
*  He's doing it. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1792.48s)]
*  He's getting criticized in the media. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1794.2s)]
*  And he says that he's helping and he's not. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1797.32s)]
*  He's making us look bad. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1800.0s)]
*  He's making me look bad. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1802.4s)]
*  And I'll tell you this. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1805.64s)]
*  And he would like it if I said it. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1808.16s)]
*  But he's not even in a hurry. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1810.56s)]
*  He is from South Africa. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1813.44s)]
*  And he's cost-effective. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1815.76s)]
*  He's this great American leader in a room that has the portraits of some of the greatest [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1817.68s)]
*  men that ever lived in this country. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1824.32s)]
*  And he has the audacity to act like he is an elected official. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1826.68s)]
*  I am an elected official. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1832.48s)]
*  I am an important one in this situation, not him. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1834.64s)]
*  So if he wants to tank the economy in his cars, maybe that's what he deserves. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1838.72s)]
*  Now, that obviously on the face of it was explosive as the vice president [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1846.24s)]
*  personally lacerating Elon Musk. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1850.6s)]
*  And you posted this and said he's not even an American. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1854.16s)]
*  He's from South Africa. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1856.56s)]
*  He's cosplaying as this great American leader. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1857.64s)]
*  You said Vice President Vance and Elon Musk, the infighting is in full swing. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1859.48s)]
*  Happy Monday. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1863.8s)]
*  Now, Vance has replied while this debate's been going on. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1865.04s)]
*  It's a fake AI generated clip. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1869.28s)]
*  I'm not surprised this guy doesn't have the intelligence to recognise this fact. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1871.96s)]
*  But I wonder if he has the integrity to delete it now that he knows it's false. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1875.68s)]
*  If not, it could be defamation. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1879.88s)]
*  I guess we'll find out. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1881.88s)]
*  So the vice president appears to be threatening to sue you, Bishop Torber-Swan. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1883.0s)]
*  What is your response? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1887.96s)]
*  My response is bring it. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1889.8s)]
*  So, you know, there are conflicting stories out there. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1891.44s)]
*  There are some that are saying this is AI generated. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1895.72s)]
*  Of course, his office is saying that. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1898.3600000000001s)]
*  Then there are some who are saying this is authentic. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1900.28s)]
*  But the bottom line for me is when you see that going and once again, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1903.48s)]
*  this is the administration. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1910.88s)]
*  Are you saying he's lying? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1912.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to take their word for it. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1914.48s)]
*  Let me put it like that. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1916.28s)]
*  You are saying the vice president of the United States is lying. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1916.88s)]
*  This is the same administration that said black people were eating cats and dogs. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1919.96s)]
*  OK, but just to be clear, just to be clear, when JD Vance has now posted to his ex account, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1923.28s)]
*  it's a fake AI generated clip. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1930.1200000000001s)]
*  When he says that, you don't believe him. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1933.08s)]
*  I'm saying I don't take him at his word. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1936.6s)]
*  JD Vance also said black folks were eating dogs. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1939.48s)]
*  So his word doesn't mean much to me. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1943.24s)]
*  So if it turns out you're wrong, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1946.24s)]
*  when a more credible source stands in respect, then I'll believe it. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1948.08s)]
*  But Bishop Thomas, if it turns out you're wrong, will you delete it? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1951.9199999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1956.4399999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. I have no problem deleting it if it turns out I'm wrong. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1958.04s)]
*  But I'm not taking the word of an administration that lies for breakfast, lunch and dinner. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1960.76s)]
*  OK, check. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1967.12s)]
*  I want to ask you this on a bigger picture. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1969.3999999999999s)]
*  At some point, if Tesla stock keeps tanking and the global campaign to take down Tesla [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1971.32s)]
*  because they don't like Elon Musk continues at the rate that it's going [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1978.2s)]
*  and becomes a real existential threat to one of his biggest companies, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1982.8799999999999s)]
*  at what point does Elon Musk give up his political career? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1987.48s)]
*  You know, get out of the White House, get out of Mar-a-Lago, get away from Donald Trump [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1991.44s)]
*  and come and save his businesses. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1995.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't really care about his businesses at all. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=1998.28s)]
*  In fact, the number one thing I want is the government to stop subsidizing his businesses. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2001.36s)]
*  So all this theoretical cutting from Doge, did it cut a single corporate subsidy, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2006.36s)]
*  whether it's for Tesla, SpaceX, et cetera, or just any other giant corporation? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2011.72s)]
*  No, the corporations are thrilled with what Trump's doing. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2016.84s)]
*  Trump's now become a Trojan horse pretending to be a populist [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2020.04s)]
*  and unleashing these tech corporate CEOs on us [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2024.92s)]
*  who are not touching a single corporate subsidy. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2028.88s)]
*  And to what the brother said earlier, he's like, well, you know, we need to try this approach. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2032.0800000000002s)]
*  OK, I would love to try the approach of cutting. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2037.3200000000002s)]
*  I suggested cutting the defense. Have they done that? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2039.88s)]
*  No, they did the exact opposite. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2042.2s)]
*  Their budget added 100 billion dollars. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2043.48s)]
*  So are we dealing in the fact based world? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2045.6000000000001s)]
*  And you're talking about the deficit and the debt. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2047.6000000000001s)]
*  I agree with you, man. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2049.48s)]
*  So when the right or the left says, oh, the debt doesn't matter, it drives me crazy. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2050.84s)]
*  No, it does matter. It's a matter of economics. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2054.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. And so what are they doing? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2056.6400000000003s)]
*  Trump is proposing a four and a half trillion dollar tax cut [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2058.96s)]
*  for the richest people in the world and for corporations. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2062.8399999999997s)]
*  What is that to the debt? I can do math. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2066.08s)]
*  It adds four and a half trillion dollars to the debt. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2068.4s)]
*  So why are we giving a giant corporate giveaway [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2070.8399999999997s)]
*  an unbelievable amount of money? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2075.2799999999997s)]
*  They said Doge would save two trillion. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2077.8399999999997s)]
*  And they're like, oh, just kidding. One trillion. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2079.3599999999997s)]
*  Just kidding. Almost nothing. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2081.16s)]
*  And now we're going to take the four and a half trillion anyway. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2082.96s)]
*  Don't worry about it. We'll make it up in gold cards. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2084.8799999999997s)]
*  We'll make it up in tariffs. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2087.52s)]
*  We'll make it up in fairy tales. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2089.2000000000003s)]
*  And Snow White and Cinderella will dance in and somehow magically not add to the debt. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2090.88s)]
*  They're going to increase the debt massively. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2096.0s)]
*  And to what Bishop said, listen, don't do not conflate [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2098.92s)]
*  the great anger of the American people and the frustration with these billionaire [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2103.1200000000003s)]
*  donors of both the left and the right, the Democratic Party and the right [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2107.0400000000004s)]
*  and the Republican Party with what a bunch of idiot [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2110.28s)]
*  radicals are doing in lighting Tesla's on fire. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2113.8s)]
*  Because if you conflate those two things, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2117.0s)]
*  then it feeds into the right wing narrative. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2119.6000000000004s)]
*  And Piers, the most important thing out of all this entire discussion is [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2121.84s)]
*  words like domestic terrorism. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2126.6400000000003s)]
*  Now, Pam Bondi with the mental use of the word weapons or phrase [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2128.52s)]
*  weapons of mass destruction. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2133.32s)]
*  And in this talk of defamation, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2135.96s)]
*  billionaires, Trump and Elon Musk suing anyone who criticizes them. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2138.4s)]
*  What happened to free speech absolutism? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2142.96s)]
*  Now it's thin skin absolutism. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2145.52s)]
*  Oh, no, you hurt my feelings. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2148.24s)]
*  I'm going to sue you. Oh, my stocks down. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2150.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to sue you. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2153.08s)]
*  Well, I know I don't have anything to do with your stock. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2154.0s)]
*  Your stock is your business. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2156.08s)]
*  You chose to play dress up in the White House and pretending that you're going to [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2157.4799999999996s)]
*  cut things and just shovel more corporate subsidies to you and your friends. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2161.4399999999996s)]
*  Don't come crying to me about how your stock is crashing. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2165.6s)]
*  Well, you're not even running these companies. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2168.6s)]
*  So go back to work or shut up. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2170.6s)]
*  Oh, my God. I'm sorry. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2173.88s)]
*  Did I offend you? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2174.96s)]
*  Are you going to sue me? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2176.04s)]
*  Is it defamation? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2177.44s)]
*  Did I hurt your feelings? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2178.84s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2180.56s)]
*  What happened to me? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2181.7599999999998s)]
*  What happened to me? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2183.3199999999997s)]
*  How do you think? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2184.52s)]
*  Don't like Elon. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2185.44s)]
*  They're protesting because Elon is gutting our federal government. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2186.6s)]
*  We have a complete oligarchy running this country and thousands and tens of [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2189.36s)]
*  thousands of hardworking Americans, including veterans, are being arbitrarily [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2193.7999999999997s)]
*  fired by this unelected billionaire. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2197.68s)]
*  That's why people are protesting, not just because they want to go. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2199.92s)]
*  Don't like Elon. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2202.6s)]
*  But it's also true, Taylor. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2203.6s)]
*  Look, I get all the fury. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2205.0s)]
*  Fine. OK. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2207.16s)]
*  But actually, I thought that Kaiser made a very good point earlier, which is [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2208.3199999999997s)]
*  everyone's tried everything else for decades and decades and decades. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2212.64s)]
*  You're talking about billionaires for a planet's country. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2217.08s)]
*  As Kaiser acknowledged, both political parties have had billionaires in power. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2219.52s)]
*  We absolutely have not, quote, tried everything else. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2223.3199999999997s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2225.7599999999998s)]
*  We've had rich people running this country for way too long. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2226.4s)]
*  That's the whole problem. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2229.8399999999997s)]
*  OK, but what about this element to it? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2230.8399999999997s)]
*  What about the hypocrisy on the left? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2232.4s)]
*  And I'll show you what I mean by this. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2234.64s)]
*  I want to play Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kivel talking about the Tesla stuff. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2236.28s)]
*  I find it interesting that there's a growing trend of cyber trucks being [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2241.4s)]
*  vandalised and used as skate ramps or covered in garbage. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2244.92s)]
*  I think that's it. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2249.44s)]
*  I think that's it. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2251.44s)]
*  To be fair, to be fair, that might not be vandalism. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2252.76s)]
*  That might just be a simple mistake because they do look a lot like a dumpster. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2256.0s)]
*  Tesla stock is way down, almost disastrously so. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2259.68s)]
*  People, please don't vandalise, don't ever vandalise Tesla vehicles. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2263.2s)]
*  And so I... [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2269.8399999999997s)]
*  LAUGHTER [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2270.8399999999997s)]
*  Taylor, the point is, once again, it's the hypocrisy there, right? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2272.8399999999997s)]
*  If it was the other way round, those two would be the first, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2276.36s)]
*  they would be the first people to be ranting and raving. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2279.88s)]
*  If anyone was making fun of acts of wanton vandalism and arson, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2283.2799999999997s)]
*  why is that ever funny? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2289.08s)]
*  Let's talk about hippo. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2290.08s)]
*  Let's talk about hippo. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2291.08s)]
*  Hang on, Bishop. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2292.08s)]
*  Let's for Taylor first. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2293.08s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2294.08s)]
*  What's your question exactly? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2295.08s)]
*  I don't... [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2296.72s)]
*  These are a couple of people making fun of Teslas. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2297.72s)]
*  What's the hypocrisy here? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2300.16s)]
*  The media. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2301.16s)]
*  They and their audience are as one in finding it funny that people are committing acts of [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2302.16s)]
*  horrific arson. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2307.72s)]
*  They're making jokes about how ugly the Teslas are because they're ugly. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2310.12s)]
*  They're making jokes about how the cyber truck looks like a dump truck or a dumpster [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2313.56s)]
*  because it looks like a dumpster. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2317.52s)]
*  That's not like... [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2319.08s)]
*  And again, it's so absurd that this entire panel, you guys have conflated a peaceful [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2320.08s)]
*  protest movement with the actions of one or two random people who did some... [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2324.92s)]
*  Yeah, threw a Molotov cocktail. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2332.28s)]
*  This is a peaceful protest movement that has been taking place across the country. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2333.88s)]
*  It's going to take place at 500 Tesla dealerships. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2339.6s)]
*  But I'm looking at people. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2341.4s)]
*  I'm looking at clips every day. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2342.4s)]
*  Not only are people chucking Molotov cocktails, but spitting and keying Teslas, committing [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2344.12s)]
*  just endless acts of vandalism and violence, putting swastikas on them, comparing them [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2349.28s)]
*  to Nazis and so on. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2356.0s)]
*  And I'm just like, again, they're supposed to be the caring, sharing good people, the [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2357.56s)]
*  liberals. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2363.2s)]
*  And you're all cheering. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2364.2s)]
*  You're all cheering. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2366.0s)]
*  This nonsense. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2367.0s)]
*  Kaizen. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2368.0s)]
*  Given Kaizen's put his hand up politely, he may speak first. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2369.0s)]
*  Kaizen. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2373.56s)]
*  Yeah, we got to find a way to talk better, guys, because this is not good. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2374.56s)]
*  And this is actually an example, this is a microcosm of the bigger issue with civil discourse [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2378.6s)]
*  in this country. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2383.04s)]
*  So, Taylor, I agree with you that this is a fringe that is not representative of the [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2384.04s)]
*  whole. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2388.28s)]
*  And I said that earlier, and I'll say it again. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2389.28s)]
*  Both the left and the right have fringes that need to be called out and condemned, and the [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2391.36s)]
*  core needs to distance themselves from that fringe. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2395.28s)]
*  I think what Pierce is saying is that when you have people clapping on multiple late [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2398.0s)]
*  night comedy shows about Tesla's getting vandalized, it's indicative of the zeitgeist [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2402.84s)]
*  that is sympathetic to hostile acts of aggression toward people who are middle class citizens [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2408.04s)]
*  who are having their private property be vandalized. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2413.76s)]
*  But again, I actually want to move off of this point and focus. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2416.4s)]
*  Taylor, please, my hand was up. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2419.92s)]
*  Freddie, please, can I talk? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2421.92s)]
*  OK, so I just want to finish and then I'll hear you out. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2423.48s)]
*  I have not interrupted you either. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2426.88s)]
*  So I think the bigger thing we need to focus on, and I think Taylor made a good point, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2429.1200000000003s)]
*  is the influence of billionaires in this country historically. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2433.76s)]
*  If people want to say that there's an oligarchy now, I would say that there's always been [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2436.8s)]
*  an oligarchy. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2439.92s)]
*  We're just seeing one of the billionaires transparently engaging with government. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2440.92s)]
*  What I actually find personally refreshing that at least I know who it is this time and [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2444.6400000000003s)]
*  I can examine from first principles, do I like what he's doing or not? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2448.96s)]
*  So let me articulate what I see from based on what Howard Lutnick and Scott Besant and [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2452.84s)]
*  other members of Trump's team have said is their strategy. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2458.6800000000003s)]
*  They want to raise one trillion dollars to cut the deficit by tariffs, this Trump gold [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2461.6s)]
*  card and reshoring manufacturing in the United States. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2466.92s)]
*  They want to remove a trillion dollars of spending through Doge. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2470.68s)]
*  And that's overall their plan to get the deficit in tact to make sure that we're not entering [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2474.72s)]
*  the situation where all social services and health care are going to be cut for everyone. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2480.08s)]
*  So if people don't like that plan on this panel, I would like to hear the alternative [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2484.7599999999998s)]
*  plan, because for the last 25 years, we've tried the bureaucratic means, we've tried [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2489.88s)]
*  working within the system, we have not made progress and we are in an emergency scenario [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2495.08s)]
*  right now. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2500.88s)]
*  So Bishop Swan, I think there's genuine grievances on some of the way the Trump team has messaged [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2501.88s)]
*  around DEI. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2506.2000000000003s)]
*  We've got to bring everybody in because we're wrapping up. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2507.2000000000003s)]
*  I saw Cenk very unusually raising his own hand, asking for permission to speak. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2510.32s)]
*  I like this new development. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2515.76s)]
*  It's a whole new thing, Kiser, entirely down to you. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2518.44s)]
*  So Cenk, given the unprecedented nature of your polite request to speak, I'll return [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2521.12s)]
*  the floor to you. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2526.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2528.0s)]
*  So, Kiser keeps saying, hey, we've tried everything, why don't we try this? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2529.0s)]
*  Kiser, sorry. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2532.44s)]
*  Kiser, sorry, sorry. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2533.44s)]
*  Sorry, sorry. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2534.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2535.44s)]
*  It's the first time I'm meeting you, brother. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2536.44s)]
*  And I like you. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2537.92s)]
*  I like what you're saying. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2538.92s)]
*  I think that you're making a lot of good points about the oligarchy and the billionaires that [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2539.92s)]
*  control both parties. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2543.76s)]
*  And so I like that we're having a real conversation here. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2545.36s)]
*  OK? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2548.04s)]
*  So now, but there's one thing we haven't tried. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2549.04s)]
*  That's the 800-pound gorilla in the room. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2552.0800000000004s)]
*  Populous Left, Bernie Sanders, et cetera, the only guys who don't take donor money, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2554.2000000000003s)]
*  the corporate donor money. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2560.1600000000003s)]
*  So like, and then people say, oh, they took money from employees. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2561.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, you can take money from grassroots. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2565.04s)]
*  And pharmaceuticals. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2567.76s)]
*  But if you take corporate PAC money, you're corrupted by definition. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2568.76s)]
*  And pharmaceuticals. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2571.2000000000003s)]
*  You're saying about you like the transparency. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2572.3599999999997s)]
*  But I mean, I don't like a billion. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2574.6s)]
*  Look at what Trump has done. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2577.04s)]
*  He's given domestic policy to his top donor, Elon Musk, and foreign policy to his third [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2578.48s)]
*  biggest donor, Mary Maddelson. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2584.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's transparent, but it's transparently grotesque. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2586.04s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2590.8399999999997s)]
*  And it's not helping to cut the deficit at all. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2591.8399999999997s)]
*  Look, we can cut massively if you put it in Populous Left. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2594.04s)]
*  There's $30 billion in oil subsidies every single year to the richest companies in the [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2598.64s)]
*  world. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2603.56s)]
*  Why do they exist? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2604.56s)]
*  Why do they exist? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2605.56s)]
*  I can cut it right now. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2606.56s)]
*  It's the easiest thing in the world to cut. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2607.56s)]
*  But unfortunately, Trump and Elon are doing the same thing that establishment Republicans [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2610.3599999999997s)]
*  did. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2615.04s)]
*  Supply-side economic voodoo. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2616.04s)]
*  Here I'll kind of cut things that hurt innocent people and et cetera. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2618.08s)]
*  And it'll seem spectacular. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2623.72s)]
*  And I'll seem ugly and mean. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2624.72s)]
*  So it seems like I'm cutting a lot, right? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2626.56s)]
*  But in reality, I'll leave all of the corporations alone and I'll shovel $4.5 trillion of the [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2628.88s)]
*  average person's, average American's money right into the pockets of his corporate donors. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2634.16s)]
*  That is not something that we haven't tried. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2639.24s)]
*  That's what we've been doing for the last 50 years. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2641.28s)]
*  Give the Populous Left a chance and we will cut the hell out of this budget. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2644.2s)]
*  We'll save the American people a ton of money. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2647.64s)]
*  The problem is that Bernie is now wrapped in a kind of weird Siamese scenario. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2650.04s)]
*  He's in a scenario with AOC, who is about the most unelectable human being I could imagine [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2656.44s)]
*  the Democrats possibly putting up against somebody like Trump. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2661.2400000000002s)]
*  So that's the problem. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2664.52s)]
*  So Bishop Torbiswold, just finally from you. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2665.52s)]
*  Where do you think this ends? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2670.52s)]
*  I mean, the mass demonstrations coming this weekend against Elon. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2671.52s)]
*  Again, I would ask you, do you think Elon's going to bail on this? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2675.2000000000003s)]
*  Is it all getting a bit too hot in the political part of his kitchen? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2678.4s)]
*  Well I don't know if he'll bail. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2682.96s)]
*  But I will say, you brought the example of Jimmy Kimmel, etc. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2684.56s)]
*  I remind you all of during the campaign of a comedian at a Trump rally calling Puerto [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2688.12s)]
*  Rico a floating island of garbage and making disparaging remarks. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2694.96s)]
*  Yes he did. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2700.6s)]
*  And making disparaging remarks about black people and other folk. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2701.6s)]
*  And the same folk complaining about Jimmy Kimmel, etc. laughed at that and said, hey, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2707.68s)]
*  give it a break. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2712.12s)]
*  It's just comedy. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2713.12s)]
*  But now it's not comedy. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2714.16s)]
*  Now it's something else. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2715.4s)]
*  What I'll say about Musk, there are people who want to parrot the narrative that Musk [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2716.4s)]
*  is just a businessman that's being unfairly targeted. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2720.7999999999997s)]
*  He's not just a businessman. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2724.24s)]
*  Musk dumped $250 million into Trump's campaign. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2726.3199999999997s)]
*  He's been given massive power that I don't even think he legally has. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2729.4s)]
*  He's a political actor with tremendous power inside the White House. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2734.12s)]
*  And so criticizing power is a terrorist. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2739.04s)]
*  But he also, sorry to hold my own hand up, he also still runs companies which the left [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2742.0s)]
*  historically, i.e. six months ago, thought were fantastic because they promoted the very [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2748.92s)]
*  causes that they would most align themselves to. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2755.4s)]
*  Green energy being one of them. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2758.88s)]
*  Now they're turning their full fury, their swastika, Nazi screaming, key ranting, spitting, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2760.76s)]
*  firebombing fury on a company, on a company which is literally doing more than any other [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2769.28s)]
*  in America to advance the cause of green energy for cars. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2776.7200000000003s)]
*  And I say hypocrisy. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2781.32s)]
*  So I've got, I used to have, I used to have an FBI agent assigned to me. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2783.52s)]
*  I don't know if I have one under this administration because of the massive number of death threats [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2790.76s)]
*  and things that I get on a weekly basis. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2795.1600000000003s)]
*  Now when Biden was in office and I was criticizing the Democrats for what I considered their [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2799.8399999999997s)]
*  apathy toward the Black agenda and what they had promised to Black people, people swore, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2805.3999999999996s)]
*  oh, you must be paid by the Republicans, by the conservatives, yada, yada, yada. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2810.68s)]
*  And now Trump's in office and I criticize those on the right. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2816.9199999999996s)]
*  Oh, I must be a Democratic shill. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2820.96s)]
*  And all of the right wingers who applauded me when I was criticizing Biden are the ones [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2823.72s)]
*  calling my church phone and threatening to murder me and my family. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2829.52s)]
*  So I understand exactly what you're saying. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2833.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of hypocrisy on all sides. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2835.9599999999996s)]
*  Final word to you, Taylor. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2838.24s)]
*  I'm sorry, Kaizen, the hand signal only works once really, but nice try. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2839.24s)]
*  You can't get back in after a final word. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2845.12s)]
*  Taylor, last word to you. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2847.3199999999997s)]
*  Make it quick. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2848.4399999999996s)]
*  I just want to reiterate that these are peaceful protests. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2849.4399999999996s)]
*  These are, this is overwhelmingly protesting. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2852.8s)]
*  Molotov cocktails aren't peaceful, just to FYI. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2855.28s)]
*  I know that people said they were in the Black Lives Matter riots, but no, they're not. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2857.84s)]
*  Let's not forget that tens of thousands of hardworking middle class and low class Americans... [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2862.88s)]
*  Actually, some of them were riots, Bishop, they were. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2868.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2870.6000000000004s)]
*  Some of the protests in Black Lives Matter turned into rioting. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2871.6000000000004s)]
*  You talk about the blindness of the opposition. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2875.84s)]
*  The truth is, on the Black Lives Matter protests, some of them became riots, indisputably. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2880.2s)]
*  And if you try and deny that, you are falling into the same trap you accused the right of [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2886.3999999999996s)]
*  doing, which is turning a blind eye when their own side does something. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2891.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not a left winger, I'm an independent. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2895.48s)]
*  But you broadly label them as Black Lives Matter riots. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2897.6s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2902.24s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2903.24s)]
*  Yes, you did. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2904.24s)]
*  I said some of the Black Lives Matter protests turned into riots. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2905.24s)]
*  They did. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2908.04s)]
*  It's a fact. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2909.04s)]
*  And by the way, I think some of the January 6th protesters were rioters too. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2910.52s)]
*  So I'm an equal, non-discriminatory caller out of riots when I see it and of Molotov cocktails. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2914.52s)]
*  So when Taylor says, it's all peaceful in the garden of anti-Tesla protests, I'm calling [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2920.52s)]
*  bullshit. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2926.16s)]
*  We've got to leave it there. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2927.16s)]
*  Great panel. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2928.48s)]
*  I love the New Hand movement, so I'm going to bring that in as a regular thing. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2929.48s)]
*  Check, you will be required in future, before you interrupt anyone, to raise your right [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2932.4s)]
*  hand. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2937.24s)]
*  No. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2938.24s)]
*  Great to see you all. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2941.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2942.48s)]
*  Take care. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2944.48s)]
*  And we couldn't do it without you. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIt6DItM1OA&t=2970.04s)]
