John Oliver stirred controversy this week by hosting a special on what he calls a right-wing obsession with trans athletes in women’s sports. JK Rowling told him to “read the effing room” and shared a post which slammed his 45-minute special for claiming there’s basically no advantage for male athletes and that men almost never beat women.

On that same night, the UK Women's Pool Championship Final was contested by two people who were born as men. So who is obsessed? And who is right?

For a debate that gets personal, Piers Morgan hosts feminist writer and the co-founder of Justice for Women Julie Bindel, The Crucible host Andrew Wilson, journalist Emily Austin and trans rights advocate Stassia Underwood.

**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU)
*  You're just a shock job, mate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=0.0s)]
*  It's not psychic ability. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1.2s)]
*  You're just pathetic. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2.56s)]
*  Nobody's going to listen to you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  You're an aggressive, insecure man. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=6.72s)]
*  I'm going to tell you what's going to happen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=9.32s)]
*  Do we not take you seriously? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=10.76s)]
*  Well, this is going to go viral, and a lot of people [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=12.24s)]
*  are going to take me seriously. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=14.16s)]
*  And all they're going to remember [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=15.24s)]
*  is that I told you that you couldn't put down [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=16.32s)]
*  the Dunkin' Donuts long enough to make an argument. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=17.84s)]
*  You all are fairly stupid. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=19.96s)]
*  And everything that's being said is just like a comedy show. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=22.48s)]
*  You think you can change your sex? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=25.48s)]
*  How can you ever call anybody stupid? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=27.16s)]
*  John Oliver stirred controversy this week [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=30.44s)]
*  by hosting a special on what he calls a right-wing obsession [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=32.44s)]
*  with trans athletes in a large chunk of his once-a-week show, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=35.8s)]
*  two talking about the same issue. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=40.44s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=43.2s)]
*  Well, J.K. Rowling told him to read the effing room [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=44.4s)]
*  and shared a post which slammed his 45-minute special [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  for claiming there's basically no advantage for male athletes [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  and that men almost never beat women. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=53.72s)]
*  On that same night, the UK Women's Pool Championship Final [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=56.44s)]
*  was contested by two women, by two people [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=59.44s)]
*  who were born as men, not women. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=62.4s)]
*  So who is obsessed and who is right? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=64.8s)]
*  Well, we'll debate that and we'll debate this too. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=68.24s)]
*  A lot of these men, these podcast hosts on the right [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=70.48s)]
*  that like to think of themselves as these big masculine men [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  and what am I getting out of it? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=76.52s)]
*  I can tell you this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  There's that feminism. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=78.6s)]
*  I believe I'm a woman of virtue. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=79.44s)]
*  There's that feminism coming out. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=80.28s)]
*  Yeah, there's the feminism. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=82.08s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry, did you want to speak over a man? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=83.8s)]
*  Inside of society right this second, right, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  masculinity is not only punished, but also women on the right, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=88.56s)]
*  covert feminists on the right are constantly [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=92.32s)]
*  and consistently talking about how they need [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=94.24s)]
*  to have privilege in society. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=95.92s)]
*  Their version of masculinity is men who take care of us, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  men who protect us, men who do all of this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=100.56s)]
*  Those are all duties that men have towards women. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=102.6s)]
*  Great, what are the duties that women have towards men? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, that became a breakout moment [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  from our adolescence debate [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=109.72s)]
*  and Andrew Wilson's chilling warning, of course, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=111.52s)]
*  about the dangers of covert feminism. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=113.64s)]
*  Well, we have a panel of feminists, covert and otherwise, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=116.64s)]
*  to debate, the co-founder of Justice for Women [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=120.28s)]
*  and author of Lesbian Where Are We Now, Julie Bindel, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=122.28s)]
*  the trans rights advocate, Stacia Underwood, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=125.6s)]
*  the sports journalist and political commentator, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=129.0s)]
*  Emily Austin, and the host of The Crucible, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=130.76s)]
*  Andrew Wilson. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, welcome to all of you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=134.2s)]
*  Julie Bindel, let me start with you [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  with this whole issue of trans athletes in women's sport. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  I've been talking about this as you have for many years, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=142.04s)]
*  and we've reached a point [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  where the current president of the United States [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  has basically announced a total ban [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=150.6s)]
*  on any trans athletes competing in women's sport, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=153.68s)]
*  including the upcoming global events [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=156.44s)]
*  happening in the United States, which is great. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  But it seems to me utterly astonishing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=161.64s)]
*  that we have John Oliver, who's a fellow Brit, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=164.48s)]
*  who is on American television and for 45 minutes [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  seriously trying to argue [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=172.44s)]
*  that people who are born biological males [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=174.88s)]
*  have no advantage over biological females [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=178.88s)]
*  when it comes to sport. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=182.6s)]
*  How can this still be happening? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=184.44s)]
*  It's utterly ludicrous. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  Either we have women's sports or we don't. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=188.32s)]
*  Either we recognise that sports are segregated [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  for good reason or we don't [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=194.56s)]
*  and we put everybody in together and then see what happens, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=196.76s)]
*  which is like the bad old days [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=199.96s)]
*  when girls and women wouldn't come forward to compete [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=201.76s)]
*  or they wouldn't join tournaments. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=204.64s)]
*  Even if you look at something like poker, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=206.32s)]
*  which Oliver was joking about, how can this be an issue? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=208.72s)]
*  How can poker even be discriminatory? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=212.88s)]
*  There's no strength involved. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=216.44s)]
*  But the sexist environment of poker tournaments [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=218.04s)]
*  and what men would call joking and teasing and the like [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=223.28s)]
*  put many women off competing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  And so let's just see what happens if we then decide [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=229.64s)]
*  that there should be no single-sex sports [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=233.68s)]
*  and that women's sports were ridiculous to start with, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=235.92s)]
*  because that's what he's arguing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=238.64s)]
*  Yeah. Stacia, look, as I've repeatedly made clear [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=240.64s)]
*  about my own position, which often gets completely misconstrued, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=245.16s)]
*  as I think does Julie's, as I think does JK Rowling [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=248.2s)]
*  and everybody else, my position is that I absolutely respect [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=252.08s)]
*  people who are trans. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=257.44s)]
*  I respect people who are trans as rights to fairness [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=258.56s)]
*  and equality and safety. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=261.56s)]
*  I want trans people to have the same fairness, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=263.2s)]
*  equality and safety that I enjoy [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=265.2s)]
*  or that my daughter enjoys, for example. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=267.6s)]
*  So let's be clear about that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=269.6s)]
*  Nothing that I'm about to say is what some people try [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=271.92s)]
*  and frame it as is transphobic, right? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=275.16s)]
*  I'm not remotely transphobic. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=276.88s)]
*  I am fully supportive of trans people's rights [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=279.36s)]
*  to lead the same life as the rest of us. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=282.08s)]
*  However, and it's a big however, when it erodes, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  when the battle for trans rights to fairness, equality [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=289.8s)]
*  in particular, but also safety, when that erodes clearly [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=293.28s)]
*  women's rights to fairness and equality and safety, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=298.0s)]
*  I have a big problem with that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=302.4s)]
*  And no place is this more glaring [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=303.84s)]
*  than in the sporting arena, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=306.6s)]
*  where you see time and again now, biological men [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=308.36s)]
*  who identify as trans, who were pretty unsuccessful [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  competing against other biological men. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=317.0s)]
*  And suddenly they're winning against women [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=319.92s)]
*  or taking Olympic places from women, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=322.92s)]
*  And I think the UN came up with nearly 900. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=326.56s)]
*  I mean, John Oliver tried to ridicule this, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=329.36s)]
*  but nearly 900 medals around the world, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=331.72s)]
*  I think in the last year went to trans athletes [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=334.8s)]
*  and women's sport. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=338.64s)]
*  This cannot be right. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=339.48s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=340.68s)]
*  It's not equal. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=341.88s)]
*  As we saw in the Paris Olympics in the boxing ring, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=342.88s)]
*  where you had boxers competing who were banned [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=347.08s)]
*  from the world championships [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=350.28s)]
*  because they had reportedly male chromosomes. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=351.4s)]
*  And you had women boxers quitting after 40 seconds [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=354.88s)]
*  because they'd never been hit so hard, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=358.32s)]
*  genuinely fearing they might get killed in the ring. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=360.36s)]
*  When it comes to this, we are now reaching to me, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=363.2s)]
*  not just an unfair and unequal place in this debate, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=368.24s)]
*  but a dangerous place in this debate. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=370.68s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=373.16s)]
*  I think it's difficult. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=381.0s)]
*  I think that there's a lot of emphasis being put [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=385.16s)]
*  on trans people in sports specifically. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  I made it very clear, like I am not here to spit facts [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=392.68s)]
*  or spew anything in terms of statistics or anything like that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=396.12s)]
*  I have my lived experience as a trans person. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  I feel that there's so much attention being put [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=407.12s)]
*  onto this specific subject [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  because what you guys really want underlying [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=412.32s)]
*  is the eradication of trans people [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=415.36s)]
*  and them to not be involved in any system. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=417.36s)]
*  No, no, you see there, look. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=419.36s)]
*  Don't look, but look, that's it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  That is the dumbest argument [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  I've ever heard in my life. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=424.88s)]
*  Right, it's ludicrous. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=427.48s)]
*  Where have you got that from? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=429.28s)]
*  What a bad representation of a trans person [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=430.48s)]
*  to speak out for others. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=432.28s)]
*  I'm more so referring to the right... [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=434.2s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to say... [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=435.92s)]
*  I have seen certain things that you've said in other interviews [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=437.96s)]
*  pierced with my friend, Wassam, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=441.12s)]
*  and other trans individuals, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=443.68s)]
*  and I just feel that the emphasis that is being put on... [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=445.71999999999997s)]
*  And what was transphobic? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=447.96s)]
*  What have I ever said that could be remotely construed [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=449.68s)]
*  as transphobic or trans-hating [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=453.24s)]
*  or wanting to get rid of trans people ever? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=456.0s)]
*  I challenge you right now. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=460.04s)]
*  I haven't really directed that at you [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=461.48s)]
*  just from sitting here. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  I more so am just here to say that I feel [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  that the issue that's being pressed is because it's a... [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=469.44000000000005s)]
*  You just directed it at him. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=472.68s)]
*  What are you talking... [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=474.48s)]
*  You directed it at him. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=475.64000000000004s)]
*  I think that the issue that is being put on trans athletes [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=478.76s)]
*  is a way to eradicate trans people. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=484.44s)]
*  But this is... With respect, this is ridiculous. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=486.88s)]
*  Kirst, can I interject for a moment? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=488.84s)]
*  In the 1960s and 70s, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=490.64s)]
*  when feminists that came before me set up women's shelters, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=493.36s)]
*  rape crisis centres, hospital wards, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=497.52s)]
*  prison wings for women, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=500.36s)]
*  recognising that some men, not all, but a sizeable minority, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  are a threat to women because sexual violence [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=506.2s)]
*  and harassment is a threat, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=509.35999999999996s)]
*  we weren't told by men, not all of them were pleased, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=511.32s)]
*  but largely they understood. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=514.6s)]
*  We weren't told by men, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=515.88s)]
*  you're trying to erase and eradicate men. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=516.88s)]
*  The vast majority of men understood why we needed to do this. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=520.28s)]
*  All we're doing is saying men, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=523.76s)]
*  and you can call them trans women if you like, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=525.76s)]
*  but men have no place in women's prisons, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=528.24s)]
*  domestic violence shelters and sports. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=531.4s)]
*  Wait a second, hang on. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=535.12s)]
*  Okay, Emily, you want to... [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=536.24s)]
*  Yeah, Andrew, I'm going to come to you... [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=537.88s)]
*  Andrew, I'll come to you in one moment, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=539.56s)]
*  just let Emily jump in on what you were about to say, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=540.8399999999999s)]
*  I think to Stasia. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=543.28s)]
*  Making America healthy again is all the rage, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=545.68s)]
*  and many people are inspired [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=548.04s)]
*  to put their fitness first again. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=549.68s)]
*  That's why I'm excited to be working with Don and my team [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=551.56s)]
*  at Jacked Up Fitness, which is an amazing American company. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=554.4s)]
*  Last week, they installed their flagship Jacked Up Power Rack Pro [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=558.36s)]
*  for none other than RFK Junior, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=562.0799999999999s)]
*  and his team at the Department of Health HQ. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=564.1999999999999s)]
*  And I'm next, they're coming to my house [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=567.04s)]
*  to set up my Power Rack Pro, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=569.0s)]
*  and I can't wait to flex these guns. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=570.92s)]
*  It has everything you need for a full body workout at home. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=573.76s)]
*  There's a cable crossover system [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=576.8s)]
*  integrated with 200 pound weight stacks, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=578.56s)]
*  and the Smith machine is set up for hundreds of exercises. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=581.16s)]
*  Basically everything that you could do at the gym. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  If you're new to all this, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=588.56s)]
*  the Get Jacked Up program offers full body video workouts, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=589.8399999999999s)]

*  No more excuses. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=609.56s)]
*  I just think it's so infuriating [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=613.1999999999999s)]
*  because ultimately I know many trans people [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=615.12s)]
*  and I've spoken to them about playing in women's sports, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  et cetera, and the biggest issue they face [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  is that they just want to be accepted. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=623.56s)]
*  Now if I was a trans woman and I just wanted to be accepted, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=625.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna do the exact opposite of what you're doing. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=628.7199999999999s)]
*  You want to paint all of these labels on you, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=631.64s)]
*  you want to play identity politics, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=634.4799999999999s)]
*  you want to play the victim, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=636.56s)]
*  but you want it to be treated as if you're any superior. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=637.64s)]
*  That's not equality. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  You receiving special treatment that does not make you equal [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=641.64s)]
*  but makes you superior to others [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=644.56s)]
*  is not looking to be included. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=646.8399999999999s)]
*  It's actually making people detest your cause. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=648.76s)]
*  It's making people think that you are a moron [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=651.48s)]
*  and the way that you're trying to represent [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=653.84s)]
*  the trans community as a whole [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=655.48s)]
*  by just denying that there's a threat [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=657.24s)]
*  and being delusional about it [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=659.04s)]
*  is not helping the trans people. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=660.48s)]
*  You're making people look at you from the outside [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=662.4s)]
*  and say, wow, they are out of touch with reality. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=664.48s)]
*  I think that the verbiage that you used in this statement [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=667.5600000000001s)]
*  is very clear on where you stand on trans issues. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=670.2s)]
*  I'm gonna go back to my original point. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=673.44s)]
*  You guys trying to take out trans people [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=675.64s)]
*  as a way to eradicate trans people from public. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=678.9599999999999s)]
*  But we're not. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=682.56s)]
*  We're trying to eradicate lunatics like yourself. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=683.68s)]
*  Nobody, Stacia, nobody has said that. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=685.9599999999999s)]
*  And this is what happens. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=689.92s)]
*  If you don't mind me saying, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=691.92s)]
*  what happens the way that trans activists [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=693.52s)]
*  let themselves down, in my opinion, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=695.9599999999999s)]
*  and you can respond to this, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=697.8s)]
*  is that you try and shut down perfectly legitimate, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=699.3199999999999s)]
*  in fact, urgently important debate [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=702.5999999999999s)]
*  by saying that anyone who dares to question this [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=706.04s)]
*  is transphobic and wants to get rid of trans people. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=709.52s)]
*  I don't think anyone so far on this panel [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=712.12s)]
*  has said they wanna get rid of trans people [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=714.68s)]
*  or anything like it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=716.48s)]
*  And yet you keep saying, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=717.56s)]
*  you people all wanna get rid of trans people. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=719.0s)]
*  Why do you believe that? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=722.32s)]
*  Where have you got that from? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=723.84s)]
*  You cite my interviews with some of your friends, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=725.48s)]
*  but where have I said anything [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=727.8s)]
*  remotely that could be construed as transphobic? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=729.76s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=733.04s)]
*  I think the verbiage that was being used, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=733.88s)]
*  it's very clear you guys stand on all trans issues. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=736.4399999999999s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=739.2s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=740.32s)]
*  So what is the solution for the trans people [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=741.16s)]
*  that are playing sports? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=744.64s)]
*  What's the solution for them? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=745.72s)]
*  We're just supposed to kick them out all entirely? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=746.72s)]
*  There's no other- Let me give you the solution. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=748.68s)]
*  Let me give you the solution. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=751.0s)]
*  The solution's very straightforward. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=752.28s)]
*  Almost all of them competed against biological men [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=753.92s)]
*  like themselves before, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=757.4399999999999s)]
*  but they did it far less successfully. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=759.76s)]
*  So you either go back, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=761.5999999999999s)]
*  trans women athletes either compete against [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=763.0s)]
*  their biological sex, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=766.8s)]
*  or you create an entirely new category for trans athletes. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=768.5999999999999s)]
*  What you don't do is allow them to destroy [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=772.4799999999999s)]
*  the integrity of women's sport, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=775.76s)]
*  which is what is happening. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=777.88s)]
*  So it's very straightforward how you solve this. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=779.16s)]
*  I don't want trans people to be banned from playing sport. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=781.1199999999999s)]
*  I just want them to be banned like I did with the dopers [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=784.3599999999999s)]
*  when they were cheating in sport. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=787.5999999999999s)]
*  I want them to be banned from utilizing [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=789.04s)]
*  an unfair advantage. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=792.4s)]
*  It's simple as that. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=793.6s)]
*  I think- Can I ask her a question? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=796.44s)]
*  Would you think it's fair if Novak Djokovic [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=798.12s)]
*  identified as a woman [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=800.88s)]
*  and then played Serena Williams in a tennis set? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=802.44s)]
*  Do you think that that would be fair to Serena Williams [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=805.32s)]
*  who worked her whole life to become a star tennis player, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=807.48s)]
*  just to get swept by Novak, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=810.64s)]
*  who's the number one men's tennis player? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=813.0s)]
*  I just want to know if you think that that's fair. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=814.64s)]
*  No, I just think that their question is ridiculous, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=817.2s)]
*  because they're- [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=819.52s)]
*  Why is it ridiculous? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not ridiculous at all. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=823.1600000000001s)]
*  I see how it's trying to be framed. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=824.6s)]
*  I just, I'm gonna keep going back to my original point. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=827.48s)]
*  Your guys' excessive attention on wanting to remove [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=830.5600000000001s)]
*  trans people from sports and have them play [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=833.7600000000001s)]
*  in their biological sex, which makes no sense, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=835.9200000000001s)]
*  because even in John Oliver's interview- [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  Or in their own category. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=840.5200000000001s)]
*  In his, the category, that would make sense to me. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=843.2s)]
*  Or in their own category. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=844.7600000000001s)]
*  There's not enough of them to create a category. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=846.7600000000001s)]
*  Like, the percentile is so small. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=849.8399999999999s)]
*  Actually, there are. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=851.56s)]
*  Actually, there are. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=852.64s)]
*  In their category? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=853.4799999999999s)]
*  There actually are an increasingly large number [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=854.56s)]
*  of trans athletes around the world, actually. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=856.68s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=858.68s)]
*  Andrew, you'll be waiting very patiently, thank you. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=859.52s)]
*  This seems to me, this whole debate so far, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=862.68s)]
*  highlights the way this debate has been framed now for years, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  which is that any attempt to question [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=868.8399999999999s)]
*  what is obviously grotesquely unfair and unequal, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=871.9599999999999s)]
*  and indeed unsafe, is branded transphobic, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=875.4s)]
*  even when there's no evidence to suggest [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=879.16s)]
*  that the people saying it are transphobic. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=881.04s)]
*  Well, it's not just that. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=884.68s)]
*  I mean, basically everybody in this panel is wrong. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=885.8s)]
*  So, to start with, this person says, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=888.36s)]
*  this person says, well, you know, the thing is, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=892.52s)]
*  is you just want to erase transgender people [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=894.8s)]
*  altogether, Pierce, and then says, I wasn't saying that. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=898.36s)]
*  Pierce, I wasn't saying that you want to erase trans people, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=900.92s)]
*  not you specifically, when clearly that's what you were saying. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=903.2s)]
*  At least get behind the statements that you're making. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=905.76s)]
*  The turf starts out by saying, well, I've been here [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=909.44s)]
*  reinforcing women's rights this entire time, right? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=912.96s)]
*  And then the turf says, right on top of that, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=916.2s)]
*  well, but you know, poker's very misogynistic. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=919.6s)]
*  She can't wait to dunk on men. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=921.96s)]
*  Very first thing she does is dunk on men [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=923.52s)]
*  in order to somehow elevate women, right? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=925.76s)]
*  You're all insane. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  The truth is, is that the only reason [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=929.64s)]
*  that this happens to begin with [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=931.48s)]
*  is because women vote for it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=933.16s)]
*  They vote for it. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=934.92s)]
*  They vote blue. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=935.8s)]
*  They vote left. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=936.64s)]
*  They vote in the same politicians [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=937.48s)]
*  who get behind all of this stuff. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=939.28s)]
*  You're the deciding vote, right? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=941.2s)]
*  And you have empowered women to do that [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=943.08s)]
*  as much as possible for the political process to do that. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=945.08s)]
*  All of you are responsible for this, every last one of you. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=948.4s)]
*  Really glad that you're so powerful. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=953.08s)]
*  I'm for Trump. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=954.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=956.28s)]
*  Leave me out of this one. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=959.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=960.64s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=962.48s)]
*  Well, that's why Andrew kept saying all of you. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=963.32s)]
*  Do you include Emily, Andrew, or not? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=965.04s)]
*  Well, I just assumed it. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=968.16s)]
*  I just assumed it. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=970.16s)]
*  But this is the truth. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=971.36s)]
*  The truth is, we begin with these crazy ideas, right? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=972.44s)]
*  Under patriarchal rule, under men, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=977.96s)]
*  this would never have happened, right? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=980.44s)]
*  If you look at how men vote, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=982.48s)]
*  they vote against this nonsense. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=983.88s)]
*  And it's fathers who are on the front lines against it. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=985.36s)]
*  It's women who are trying to transition to the children, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=987.9200000000001s)]
*  not men. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=990.76s)]
*  Give me a case example of where male fathers [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=991.6s)]
*  are trying to transition their kids. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=994.36s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=996.04s)]
*  It's a female-only phenomenon. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=997.12s)]
*  Literally a female-only phenomenon. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=999.3199999999999s)]
*  That is insane. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1001.04s)]
*  Yeah, show me one. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1001.88s)]
*  Show me one male father who's fighting in the courts [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1003.04s)]
*  to transition their son to a girl. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1005.76s)]
*  Actually, I made a podcast series about this. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1008.2s)]
*  I see men on TikTok that are diseased. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1010.64s)]
*  I interviewed quite a few fathers [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1013.88s)]
*  who are pushing for this. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1015.72s)]
*  But the point is that this is something that benefits men, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1017.16s)]
*  and it's men that are the ones that are saying they're women. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1020.28s)]
*  They are all of a sudden the oppressed, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1023.8s)]
*  and feminists like me are the oppressor, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1025.96s)]
*  and that they want... [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1028.56s)]
*  You voted for it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1029.3999999999999s)]
*  They're too weak and pathetic to fight and play against other men. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1030.3999999999999s)]
*  And what do they do? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1036.3999999999999s)]
*  Do you vote left? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1037.24s)]
*  They come and beat up on women. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1037.92s)]
*  Do you vote left, ma'am? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1040.12s)]
*  I don't know what vote left means. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1042.12s)]
*  Do you vote for the left-wing party of your nation? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1044.2s)]
*  Do you vote for Democrats? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1045.96s)]
*  Do you vote for what would be considered [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1047.56s)]
*  the Democrats of your nation? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1049.96s)]
*  No, I wouldn't have voted for the Democrats. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1051.04s)]
*  I would not have voted for the disgrace of that party. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1053.24s)]
*  And I also wouldn't have voted for Trump. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1057.28s)]
*  But the point is... [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1059.3600000000001s)]
*  If we look... Hang on. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1060.16s)]
*  Hey, let me finish. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1061.16s)]
*  We'll follow up very quickly. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1061.8400000000001s)]
*  Very quickly. Very quickly. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1063.28s)]
*  We live in a different context here. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1064.2s)]
*  What I'm saying to you is this. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1065.44s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1067.04s)]
*  If you look at the voting patterns of women in both the UK [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1068.16s)]
*  and the United States, they're usually the deciding vote [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1071.1200000000001s)]
*  when it comes to degeneracy. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1073.88s)]
*  That includes... [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1075.16s)]
*  What's that got to do with anything? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1076.0s)]
*  It includes on the trans issue. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1076.8400000000001s)]
*  So here you are. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1079.52s)]
*  It's the very thing that you push for, for empowerment of women [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1080.64s)]
*  that is now causing your very problem. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1084.32s)]
*  You have to now convince women. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1086.64s)]
*  Men are already there. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1088.72s)]
*  Men have already said, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1089.8s)]
*  No, we don't want this. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1090.88s)]
*  Apart from the men that are claiming to be women. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1091.4s)]
*  Yeah, apart from the women who are claiming to be men, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1096.44s)]
*  which now it's almost equalised. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1099.3600000000001s)]
*  You remember that part, right? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1101.0s)]
*  This phenomenon, though, is categorically rejected by men [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1102.3600000000001s)]
*  and reinforced by women. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1105.84s)]
*  And TERFs like you did everything that you could possibly do [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1107.72s)]
*  in order to push that. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1110.68s)]
*  You did everything you could do to push that. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1111.96s)]
*  And now you get to reap the whirlwind. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1114.1200000000001s)]
*  So I don't care if women in their sports teams [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1116.3200000000002s)]
*  are getting their teeth kicked in. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1118.68s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1120.0800000000002s)]
*  Reap what you sow. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1121.0s)]
*  As you sow, so shall you reap. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1122.64s)]
*  You seem a nice person. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1125.52s)]
*  You seem like a lovely person. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1127.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry that you have to deal with the consequences [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1129.24s)]

*  And the stock market is precarious. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1155.8400000000001s)]

*  All the details are in the description. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1225.2s)]
*  Now on with the show. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1227.0800000000002s)]
*  On the subject of it, because Andrew made a lot of news [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1230.2s)]
*  on social media with his debate with Tommy Layron last week [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1232.72s)]
*  after accusing her of being a covert feminist. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1236.3200000000002s)]
*  Just remind people of that clip which went viral. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1239.5600000000002s)]
*  Most men are born to be protectors and providers. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1242.16s)]
*  I can't imagine my dad saying, you know what, to my mom, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1245.2800000000002s)]
*  you know what, I'm not gonna be a protector and a provider [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1249.24s)]
*  unless you do this. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1251.76s)]
*  That's not how real men operate. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1253.08s)]
*  Real men are protectors and providers [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1255.24s)]
*  and they marry women who hopefully have some virtue [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1257.76s)]
*  but also bring a lot to the table as well [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1260.6s)]
*  that are great mothers, great wives, caretakers of the home. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1262.56s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with being a traditional wife [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1266.28s)]
*  and mother. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1268.36s)]
*  So Emily, what do you say? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1269.2s)]
*  Are you a covert feminist like Tommy? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1270.8s)]
*  Did you agree with Andrew's assessment? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1272.72s)]
*  I'm not a covert feminist. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1277.56s)]
*  I am very outwardly, you know, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1279.04s)]
*  the word feminism has been hijacked by like the woke left [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1281.36s)]
*  who uses it as an excuse for psychotic women and liberals [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1284.1599999999999s)]
*  to scream on the streets, we want equal rights [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1286.84s)]
*  when we have equal rights. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1288.76s)]
*  I'm more so an empowered woman who encourages other women [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1290.72s)]
*  to, you know, be independent, work hard, chase your dreams [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1294.04s)]
*  and that doesn't come at the expense of being feminine. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1297.0s)]
*  It doesn't come at the expense of now as a feminist, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1301.4399999999998s)]
*  you need to eradicate all men. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1304.56s)]
*  I don't think everything is so black or white. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1306.36s)]
*  Listening to that debate, they spoke a bit about gender roles [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1308.52s)]
*  and here's my take on that. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1311.16s)]
*  If you're gonna have gender role expectations for your man, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1312.72s)]
*  that's a personal choice. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1315.88s)]
*  Emily Austin has high expectations of her man. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1317.28s)]
*  He has to be working hard, he should be successful, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1320.2s)]
*  he should, you know, pay attention to how I feel, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1322.96s)]
*  like there should be certain gender roles [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1325.1200000000001s)]
*  he has to provide for the family, not solely, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1327.0800000000002s)]
*  but he should be providing for his family. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1330.28s)]
*  These are gender roles. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1332.6000000000001s)]
*  As a woman, I learned how to cook, I know how to clean, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1333.72s)]
*  my grandmother always tells me, my mother tells me, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1337.0400000000002s)]
*  Emily, you're gonna be a good wife, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1339.96s)]
*  you're gonna be loyal, you're gonna be supportive, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1341.44s)]
*  you're gonna act like a lady. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1342.72s)]
*  Now, there's many women who don't wanna play [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1344.3200000000002s)]
*  into the gender roles, which is fine, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1346.88s)]
*  but then don't expect your man to go out and become masculine. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1348.8000000000002s)]
*  I think it's equal. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1351.72s)]
*  Like set the expectation and then date people [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1352.8000000000002s)]
*  who meet your expectation, but in terms of covert feminism, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1355.88s)]
*  is first of all, it's such a silly term. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1359.6000000000001s)]
*  Either you support women or you don't. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1361.4s)]
*  And I'm not talking about the trans argument right now. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1364.04s)]
*  That's a separate one. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1365.64s)]
*  Not only is it not a silly term, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1367.56s)]
*  it is true that most of the political pundit women [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1369.24s)]
*  on the right are covert feminists. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1371.92s)]
*  And I'll just ask you the same exact question [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1373.36s)]
*  I asked on the mic. Because the word feminism [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1375.32s)]
*  that hijacks, that's the problem. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1376.8s)]
*  Let me finish the question, let me finish the question. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1377.8s)]
*  No, I'm talking about all the way back [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1379.96s)]
*  to first wave feminism, okay? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1381.68s)]
*  You are feminists and I'll explain [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1383.32s)]
*  by asking you the same question. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1385.12s)]
*  If it is men's duty in society to procure, refine, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1386.6399999999999s)]
*  protect resources, which then men and women, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1390.92s)]
*  or I'm sorry, women and children [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1393.48s)]
*  are the primary beneficiaries of, which they are, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1394.84s)]
*  what societal duty, which is equal to that, do women have? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1398.44s)]
*  What is it? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1401.08s)]
*  Women, we're gonna have children. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1403.96s)]
*  Men will never understand the burden [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1405.48s)]
*  of carrying a child. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1407.04s)]
*  So you have a duty to reproduce? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1407.88s)]
*  I expect women to be able to cook and clean. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1409.08s)]
*  Wait, so you have, do women have a duty to reproduce? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1411.88s)]
*  I believe we do, absolutely. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1413.72s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1414.56s)]
*  So that's the one duty that's on par. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1415.8s)]
*  Great, so that's one duty that's on par with that. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1417.8s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1419.92s)]
*  Are they? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1421.16s)]
*  Or is it the case that in every single nation in the West, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1422.64s)]
*  we are under reproductive rates in every single one of them. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1426.12s)]
*  In every single nation in the West, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1429.12s)]
*  we are lower than where we need to be for reproduction. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1431.04s)]
*  So it seems that men are fulfilling their social duty [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1435.04s)]
*  and women are not. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1437.6s)]
*  And the problem with the right is that the right [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1439.12s)]
*  doesn't ever address this and right wing females [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1441.2399999999998s)]
*  never address this. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1443.8s)]
*  Instead, they say it's equal. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1444.6799999999998s)]
*  Work and motherhood are equal. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1446.7199999999998s)]
*  They're not equal. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1449.6799999999998s)]
*  Not only are they not equal, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1450.9199999999998s)]
*  but let me give you another example here. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1452.1999999999998s)]
*  As you dive into this, try to understand [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1454.3999999999999s)]
*  that what you do is you actually hamstring women. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1456.52s)]
*  By telling women they should go and be girl boss babes [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1459.6s)]
*  and go to college starting in their 20s, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1462.76s)]
*  they actually destroy their prime reproductive years. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1465.04s)]
*  They destroy them by having families later. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1467.9199999999998s)]
*  It's the primary cause. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1470.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay, that's silly. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1471.24s)]
*  I'm 23. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1472.08s)]
*  Hang on, listen. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1472.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm not having to go anytime soon. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1473.76s)]
*  It's the primary cause for the reproduction crisis. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1474.6s)]
*  It's the primary cause of the reproduction crisis in the West [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1476.9199999999998s)]
*  is that women defer families till they're in their 30s. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1480.3999999999999s)]
*  Why do you think the average age of marriage [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1483.0s)]
*  is 32 in the United States? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1484.76s)]
*  I think it just got raised to 33. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1486.68s)]
*  Yes, you're gonna have way less kids. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1488.8s)]
*  Okay, part of girl bossing is when you say [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1491.48s)]
*  career women are right on par with mothers. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1494.2s)]
*  They're not and society should be glorifying one, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1497.8s)]
*  not socially shaming the other, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1500.88s)]
*  but you shouldn't give them the same elevation [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1502.32s)]
*  you give to mothers and matrons of families. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1504.32s)]
*  That is peer covert feminism. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1506.88s)]
*  Okay, I'm gonna answer you with the following. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1508.92s)]
*  I don't believe in the glorification [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1512.68s)]
*  and especially I see it amongst Gen Zers [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1514.44s)]
*  of not having children. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1516.32s)]
*  I actually think it's disgraceful [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1517.4s)]
*  and I don't think it's a flex at all [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1519.24s)]
*  to brag about not wanting to repopulate. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1520.92s)]
*  It just shows me that you're so insecure [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1523.24s)]
*  that you're gonna be a bad parent [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1525.2s)]
*  that you're not doing it. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1526.52s)]
*  On the other hand, I'll ask you a question in return. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1527.72s)]
*  Would you prefer a child growing up in a damaged family [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1530.68s)]
*  with a mother who clearly wasn't ready to raise a child [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1534.0s)]
*  and raise potentially what could be a deranged child [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1537.0800000000002s)]
*  who grows up to be a serial killer or a murderer [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1541.4s)]
*  or how about this, just a really bad person [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1544.0s)]
*  rather than wait a few more years [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1546.92s)]
*  until she's ready to have her kid and then raise a mensch. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1548.72s)]
*  What do you prefer? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1552.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, so here's what we can see when we break this down. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1553.2800000000002s)]
*  What we see when we break this down [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1555.8000000000002s)]
*  is the abuse happens in the public school [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1557.0800000000002s)]
*  where you're 100 times more likely to be assayed [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1558.88s)]
*  than you are if you're in a Catholic church. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1561.44s)]
*  We see that if it is the case that you're a single mother, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1563.44s)]
*  you are a single mother especially by choice, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1566.96s)]
*  that is usually the selection of stepfather [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1569.3200000000002s)]
*  that leads to the abuse of the children. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1572.08s)]
*  We also can see via the stats [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1573.0s)]
*  that you're completely just insane here. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1575.48s)]
*  You are actually, if you stay inside of a family [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1577.8s)]
*  where you mom and dad don't even like each other, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1581.28s)]
*  your outcomes are still better, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1583.76s)]
*  still better than if you, the girl boss goes, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1586.08s)]
*  I just don't feel fulfilled. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1588.56s)]
*  I don't feel fulfilled and so I need to go [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1590.08s)]
*  and date the neighbor down the road or whatever, right? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1592.56s)]
*  The truth is, is that regardless of your fulfillment, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1595.1200000000001s)]
*  children are the duty. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1598.36s)]
*  The next generation is the duty and women have a duty [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1599.68s)]
*  to keep the family intact as well. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1602.48s)]
*  They're responsible for most of the divorces. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1604.5200000000002s)]
*  They file for the most amount of divorces, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1606.6000000000001s)]
*  not because of abuse, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1608.5600000000002s)]
*  but because of irreconcilable differences. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1609.8000000000002s)]
*  And when asked, I don't feel fulfilled. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1612.8400000000001s)]
*  And it's like, that's not how we run a society. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1615.3600000000001s)]
*  It's literally a death sentence for our whole society. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1618.0s)]
*  Look at what's going on in the UK. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1620.8400000000001s)]
*  It's a death sentence for them. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1622.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay, let me bring in Stacia, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1625.4s)]
*  who's been grimacing throughout that. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1627.08s)]
*  Stacia, why are you so outraged by what he's saying? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1629.8s)]
*  I'm not outraged. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1633.08s)]
*  I just think that you all are fairly stupid [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1633.9199999999998s)]
*  and everything that's being said is ridiculous. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1637.32s)]
*  And it's just like a comedy show being played on. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1640.6399999999999s)]
*  You think you can change your sex. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1642.48s)]
*  How can you ever call anybody stupid? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1644.08s)]
*  How can you ever call anybody stupid? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1646.28s)]
*  Yeah, she should sit that one out. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1647.9199999999998s)]
*  Hey, I'm not, I'm just sitting back [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1651.48s)]
*  watching the shit show happen. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1654.08s)]
*  I'm here for it. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1655.48s)]
*  All right, Julie. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1658.08s)]
*  How was that possible you started the shit show, honey? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1659.48s)]
*  Hang on, hang on, hang on. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1661.56s)]
*  I want to get Julie to respond to Andrew. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1662.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh, I zoned out and I thought I'd woken up in the 1950s [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1665.08s)]
*  in some TARDIS. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1669.0s)]
*  You can't take him seriously. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1670.4399999999998s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1672.08s)]
*  Oh, you mean in the 1950s, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1673.1999999999998s)]
*  you mean in the 1950s when we had intact families, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1675.08s)]
*  where 95% of women were getting married as virgins, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1677.6799999999998s)]
*  where families weren't being broken up, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1680.9199999999998s)]
*  where crime was extremely low, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1682.8s)]
*  where you only needed one income to support an entire family, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1684.1999999999998s)]
*  where mental illness was at an all time low, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1687.92s)]
*  like that 1950s. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1690.6s)]
*  I'm sorry that I make a reference to a time. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1692.04s)]
*  So are you married? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1694.64s)]
*  Are you married? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1696.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm married. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1697.28s)]
*  How do you make a, married with many children? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1698.12s)]
*  Is your wife happy? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1699.72s)]
*  Are you married with children? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1700.56s)]
*  Oh, she's ecstatic. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1702.0s)]
*  No, I'm 23. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1703.84s)]
*  I'm a boss lady girl, which seems to be driving you crazy. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1705.08s)]
*  Working, making money, waiting for the right guy to come along. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1708.68s)]
*  The only thing you have, you have no arguments. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1711.36s)]
*  You just try to assault me personally. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1713.68s)]
*  You can try, but the truth is, is that I've reproduced. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1715.6s)]
*  I am married. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1718.3999999999999s)]
*  How did I assault you? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1719.24s)]
*  I asked if you're married. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1720.08s)]
*  No, you didn't. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1721.6799999999998s)]
*  You were making a passive aggressive feminist. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1722.52s)]
*  Wait, how did I assault you? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1724.08s)]
*  How did I assault you? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1724.9199999999998s)]
*  How my wife must be miserable. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1725.76s)]
*  Andrew. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1727.0s)]
*  Your wife must be miserable. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1727.84s)]
*  To be fair, Andrew is practicing what he preaches. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1728.96s)]
*  I want to bring in another clip from a debate [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1733.2s)]
*  between Megyn Kelly and Matt Walsh on the similar theme. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1737.0s)]
*  Let's watch a little clip from this. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1740.04s)]
*  Again, having said that I like the guy, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1742.48s)]
*  I'm getting a little tired of his nonstop judgment [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1744.64s)]
*  of women who make different choices [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1747.76s)]
*  than the ones he wants us to make. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1749.5200000000002s)]
*  Sorry, Matt, you're not our Jesus. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1751.24s)]
*  We don't answer to you. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1753.8000000000002s)]
*  Live your life the way you want to live it [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1755.4s)]
*  and stop judging everybody who makes a different choice. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1757.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm sick of it. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1759.44s)]
*  Overfeminist. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1761.16s)]
*  And she went on to say this about young men [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1762.0s)]
*  not wanting to marry career women. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1765.0s)]
*  Let's take a listen to this. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1766.8000000000002s)]
*  We're now telling young, conservative, amazing women [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1768.2s)]
*  that they're not attractive if they also work. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1772.8s)]
*  If they choose to, let's say, do what I'm doing [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1776.16s)]
*  and what you're doing and get their voice out there. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1778.48s)]
*  But I'll stick with me just because I think [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1780.92s)]
*  conservatives listening to this will like the thought [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1782.64s)]
*  of another Megyn Kelly voice up and coming. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1785.04s)]
*  Now, Matt Walsh responded by saying [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1788.56s)]
*  men are generally not attracted to ambitious career. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1790.04s)]
*  Well, hang on a minute, I don't want to read a clip [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1793.72s)]
*  from Matt Walsh, I quote, he said, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1795.24s)]
*  men are generally not attracted [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1797.36s)]
*  to ambitious career-driven women [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1798.96s)]
*  and women's first priority should be children [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1801.24s)]
*  and looking after the home. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1804.16s)]
*  So, Emily, what do you think of that? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1805.32s)]
*  If you've ever felt like you're being watched online, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1808.24s)]
*  it's unfortunately because you are. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1810.64s)]
*  Hundreds of companies, so-called data brokers, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1812.56s)]
*  watch and record everything you do on the internet. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1815.6000000000001s)]
*  Even if you're using incognito mode or private tabs, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1818.64s)]
*  they can still access every purchase you make, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1822.64s)]
*  every search you type, and much more. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1825.28s)]
*  Your data can be sold to advertisers, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1828.04s)]
*  government agencies, or insurance companies [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1830.48s)]
*  who could use it to charge you more. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1833.28s)]
*  You could stand by and accept all of this, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1835.24s)]
*  or you could reclaim your privacy, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1836.96s)]
*  as I have done for many years with ExpressVPN. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1838.68s)]
*  The app redirects 100% of your online traffic [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1841.92s)]
*  through secure servers. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1844.92s)]
*  No data brokers and no third parties can see what you do. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1846.44s)]
*  ExpressVPN also hides your IP address, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1850.24s)]
*  without which there is no way of tracking you [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1852.88s)]
*  and no point in baiting your privacy in the first place. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1855.0s)]
*  A new feature called ID Defender [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1857.8s)]
*  is free to all US customers. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1860.0s)]
*  ID Defender scours the internet to remove your information [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1862.2s)]
*  from the files of data brokers. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1865.2s)]

*  Now, on with the show. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1890.44s)]
*  I think the beauty about free will is you make a choice [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1894.5200000000002s)]
*  who you wanna spend your life with. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1897.0400000000002s)]
*  Like I know many men are okay with a woman who works, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1898.4s)]
*  and I know many men are not. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1901.3200000000002s)]
*  And that's the great part is you choose [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1903.0400000000002s)]
*  who you wanna partner with. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1906.2800000000002s)]
*  So if you want a woman to be home, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1907.2s)]
*  and have five, six, seven, eight children, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1909.16s)]
*  which is a beautiful choice to make in life, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1910.92s)]
*  then go for it. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1914.0400000000002s)]
*  If you want a woman who can do both, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1915.08s)]
*  work and have children when she's ready, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1916.84s)]
*  two or three children, then go for that type of woman. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1918.96s)]
*  If you want a woman who's never home [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1922.08s)]
*  and gonna be on the road all the time, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1923.84s)]
*  and trust me, there are many beta men who would love that, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1925.9199999999998s)]
*  then go for that. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1928.76s)]
*  Like nobody is forcing you to be with a woman [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1929.6s)]
*  that doesn't cater to your needs. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1933.52s)]
*  The same way no one's forcing any women [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=1935.08s)]

*  she's about to leave her husband [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2198.12s)]
*  because he doesn't do enough domestic chores. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2199.64s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2201.76s)]
*  If you do not participate [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2202.6s)]
*  in an equitable way in your home, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2204.36s)]
*  and so what does that look like? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2205.88s)]
*  What does it look like to change these dynamics? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2207.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, we need to really assess in our homes [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2209.56s)]
*  what the work looks like. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2212.08s)]
*  Because in most homes, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2213.36s)]
*  the data supports this, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2215.2000000000003s)]
*  women do a disproportionate amount of work. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2216.96s)]
*  They just do. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2219.2400000000002s)]
*  They do more of the cooking and the cleaning [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2220.08s)]
*  and the laundry and the childcare [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2222.04s)]
*  while also working full-time. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2224.04s)]
*  And men have more time for things like their hobbies, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2225.52s)]
*  like golf, for example, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2227.6s)]
*  or just working out, running a marathon, right? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2228.76s)]
*  And so we need to have hard conversations [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2231.28s)]
*  about what our time looks like, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2233.32s)]
*  what our labor in the home looks like, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2235.16s)]
*  what is invisible labor. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2237.12s)]
*  We have to talk about these things. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2238.0s)]
*  And when we don't, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2239.2s)]
*  the alternative is that you no longer have a marriage [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2240.6s)]
*  or you don't have a happy one at least. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2243.2799999999997s)]
*  And so I share this story [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2244.72s)]
*  because I don't think I'm alone in this experience [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2246.3199999999997s)]
*  and I want people to know that there's hope [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2249.6s)]
*  and that if you have a willing and able partner, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2252.12s)]
*  you can change this. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2255.16s)]
*  You can absolutely change this. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2256.52s)]
*  I mean, Emily, I would personally, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2258.3199999999997s)]
*  I would travel continents to avoid a lady like that, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2261.88s)]
*  but what's your view of what she's saying? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2264.84s)]
*  To me, her rant, take away the gender for a moment [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2268.6400000000003s)]
*  because I actually believe women are a lot messier than men [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2273.48s)]
*  just in terms of our makeup, our clothing, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2276.8s)]
*  the abundance of clothing that we have. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2278.44s)]
*  I think we definitely purchase more accessories than men. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2281.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think we also, like I said, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2283.84s)]
*  there are gender roles I believe in [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2286.36s)]
*  should be responsible for most of the cleaning. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2287.6800000000003s)]
*  Then on the other hand, if you're marrying a slob, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2290.0s)]
*  A, you should know who you're getting into a household with. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2292.1200000000003s)]
*  But B, if you're in a happy marriage [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2295.8s)]
*  and you have a sense of communication, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2296.6400000000003s)]
*  why not just sit your partner down and be like, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2298.2400000000002s)]
*  hey, I don't mind cleaning up after you, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2300.04s)]
*  but when you throw your filthy socks on the bathroom sink [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2302.0800000000004s)]
*  or you leave your wet towel and we have mold, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2305.0s)]
*  I'd appreciate if you could not do this. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2307.7200000000003s)]
*  But I don't think it gets to an extent [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2309.2000000000003s)]
*  where divorce is justifiable [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2311.1600000000003s)]
*  unless your husband is a hoarding pig [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2313.5600000000004s)]
*  that's unbearable to live with. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2317.0800000000004s)]
*  I think she's being a little bit dramatic here. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2318.52s)]
*  And we all can acknowledge women are a bit messier than men [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2320.6800000000003s)]
*  it should be just like looking after one another. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2323.52s)]
*  It's not a big deal to clean up after your partner [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2325.76s)]
*  and that could go both ways. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2327.64s)]
*  Not everything is so black or white. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2329.2000000000003s)]
*  Andrew? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2332.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, first of all, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2334.1600000000003s)]
*  stay at home moms are mostly nowadays [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2336.12s)]
*  parking their kids in public school for most of the day. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2338.08s)]
*  Oftentimes the kids are taking buses from the city [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2341.6800000000003s)]
*  to the school buses home. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2344.32s)]
*  They're not even driving them, okay? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2345.36s)]
*  Not even driving them. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2347.12s)]
*  And they have fully furnished lunch, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2348.1600000000003s)]
*  even breakfast at most of these public schools, right? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2350.04s)]
*  They don't even have to send them with a lunch anymore. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2352.32s)]
*  They have all day to do household chores [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2354.44s)]
*  while men are working, right? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2356.76s)]
*  No, women do not do a disproportionate amount of work [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2358.7200000000003s)]
*  in comparison to men. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2361.28s)]
*  That's absurd. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2362.4s)]
*  No labor statistics support said, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2363.2400000000002s)]
*  even if we were to take household chores [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2364.7200000000003s)]
*  and put it on the table against a man's work, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2366.92s)]
*  doesn't even come close even with children, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2368.88s)]
*  especially because you're parking them most of the time [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2371.96s)]
*  in a public school for most of the day. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2374.4s)]
*  If this lady who's making this TikTok totally insane, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2376.76s)]
*  completely disconnected from reality [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2380.4s)]
*  has no idea how this actually works. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2382.32s)]
*  She's like totally insane. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2385.96s)]
*  Okay, Judy, your response to that. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2386.8s)]
*  You're gonna make a choice to marry a girl [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2387.6400000000003s)]
*  who is gonna cook and clean and do everything. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2389.6s)]
*  And me as a woman, I'm gonna make a choice [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2391.88s)]
*  to hire a housekeeper one day [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2393.84s)]
*  so that I don't have to cook and clean [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2395.7200000000003s)]
*  because that's my choice. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2397.08s)]
*  The problem is you're too obsessed [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2398.32s)]
*  with other people's choices. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2399.6400000000003s)]
*  Live and let live. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2401.1600000000003s)]
*  Like take a step back and recognize [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2402.32s)]
*  not everyone has to be as extreme as you are. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2404.6800000000003s)]
*  Like yes, women can cook and clean [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2406.88s)]
*  if they're not perfect. Oh, live and let live [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2408.44s)]
*  if they're not perfect. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2410.1200000000003s)]
*  I do live and let live. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2411.36s)]
*  Don't come see the transgenders. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2413.84s)]
*  I don't care if you're transgender. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2415.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't care if you're transgender. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2417.6000000000004s)]
*  What I don't understand is live and let live. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2419.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm not marrying a transgender. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2420.48s)]
*  Let them go play their sports. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2422.28s)]
*  Let them live and let live, absolutely. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2423.32s)]
*  Live and let live. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2425.28s)]
*  You people contradict yourself so much. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2427.1600000000003s)]
*  That's their superiority. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2429.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's their superiority. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2431.6800000000003s)]
*  No, I think you're just stupid. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2432.52s)]
*  That's it. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2433.36s)]
*  Because I'm explaining myself and making sense. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2434.2000000000003s)]
*  The explanation makes no sense. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2436.0400000000004s)]
*  Transgenders absolutely should live and let live. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2437.44s)]
*  They should not participate in sports. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2440.04s)]
*  Let's Stacia. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2441.6s)]
*  It's called a boundary. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2442.44s)]
*  Let Stacia talk. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2443.48s)]
*  Stacia, you wanted to say something. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2444.68s)]
*  You're just all walking contradictions. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2447.04s)]
*  It's crazy that you can even say something like that. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2448.84s)]
*  You guys are all fighting with each other [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2451.48s)]
*  about live and let live. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2453.44s)]
*  And we're having an entire conversation [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2454.6s)]
*  about trans people and their ability [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2456.2000000000003s)]
*  or lack of ability to be in sports. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2458.2400000000002s)]
*  So it's wild to watch him with the cigarette. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2461.28s)]
*  Like think he's all pompous. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2463.92s)]
*  And you over there acting like, it's just ridiculous. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2465.56s)]
*  Hey, I'm the only one here who is consistent. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2470.16s)]
*  I said, I don't care if you people go in [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2472.16s)]
*  and beat the tar out of women. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2474.04s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2475.28s)]
*  Go do it. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2476.2s)]
*  They voted for it. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2477.04s)]
*  I think they need a taste of their own medicine. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2478.16s)]
*  I think it's good for them. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2480.12s)]
*  And maybe some of this madness will stop [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2481.44s)]
*  if they actually have to take accountability [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2483.44s)]
*  and deal with the consequences of their own voting. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2485.6s)]
*  You're actually insane. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2487.88s)]
*  You're insane. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2489.36s)]
*  Stop, I wanna make it very clear. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2490.2s)]
*  I don't care that you're transgender. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2491.96s)]
*  I genuinely don't care if today you're a woman, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2494.32s)]
*  tomorrow you're a man, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2496.76s)]
*  the next day you wanna identify as a cat or a dog. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2497.96s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2500.84s)]
*  Like it's not my issue. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2502.48s)]
*  But when you make it my issue, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2504.2400000000002s)]
*  when you wanna play in my sport, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2506.32s)]
*  I was a tennis player my whole life. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2508.48s)]
*  If a man came along who identified as a woman, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2510.0800000000004s)]
*  who I will respect as a woman, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2513.1200000000003s)]
*  I will respect your pronouns, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2514.44s)]
*  but you wanna now eradicate women's sports, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2516.0s)]
*  now it's my problem too. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2518.48s)]
*  As long as it's not my problem and you go do you, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2520.2000000000003s)]
*  live exactly. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2522.7200000000003s)]
*  Just live and let live, man. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2524.96s)]
*  We'll just be hippies in a corner together. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2526.2799999999997s)]
*  Hotel affects you. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2528.2799999999997s)]
*  I wanna end by asking Julie. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2529.12s)]
*  Okay, I wanna end by asking Julie, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2531.56s)]
*  because Julie, you've been talking about feminism [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2533.52s)]
*  for decades. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2535.52s)]
*  We're now in a place, a strange place I think, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2536.8399999999997s)]
*  where women have more freedom to do all the things [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2539.04s)]
*  that maybe previous generations of women [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2541.92s)]
*  did not have freedom to do. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2544.08s)]
*  And many, including me actually, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2546.12s)]
*  think that's a very good step forward. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2547.6s)]
*  The only downside to this is that birth rates [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2550.24s)]
*  around the world are beginning to plummet [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2552.92s)]
*  to dangerously low levels. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2555.6800000000003s)]
*  And Elon Musk keeps warning that if they carry on like this, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2557.7200000000003s)]
*  it's gonna be a very, very serious problem [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2561.0s)]
*  for the future of the planet. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2563.64s)]
*  So let me just ask you, Julie, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2565.4s)]
*  when you look at the progress that feminism has made, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2567.08s)]
*  you can see so many ways that women's rights [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2569.88s)]
*  have been promoted in a better way. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2573.64s)]
*  But are you concerned about the dropping birth rates [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2577.0s)]
*  and the fact that women no longer, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2580.28s)]
*  because so many more are going out to work [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2582.16s)]
*  and everything else and prioritizing work, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2584.2s)]
*  perhaps over family, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2586.04s)]
*  that birth rates ultimately are obviously going to reduce [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2587.44s)]
*  and that ultimately that could be a very [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2591.8399999999997s)]
*  self-defeating thing for the planet? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2594.12s)]
*  We need to pay attention to the fact that many women, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2596.44s)]
*  when they have children, have no support, no childcare, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2600.3199999999997s)]
*  feckless fathers who leave [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2603.7999999999997s)]
*  if they're there in the first place, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2605.64s)]
*  where there is very little maternity leave, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2607.52s)]
*  hardly any financial security, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2610.92s)]
*  particularly if that woman is in an abusive relationship [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2612.96s)]
*  and can't rely on that second wage coming into the home. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2616.04s)]
*  So have a look at what will make it more attractive [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2619.56s)]
*  and feasible for women to have babies. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2622.84s)]
*  And also have a look at the women [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2625.52s)]
*  who are choosing not to have babies [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2627.84s)]
*  because they don't want to be hitched to [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2630.2000000000003s)]
*  and trapped with a man who quite frankly, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2631.96s)]
*  isn't the love of her life because of his behavior [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2635.04s)]
*  and because of his shortcomings. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2639.28s)]
*  That's what we need to be doing. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2640.92s)]
*  Okay, Stacey, I want to ask you a final question. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2644.32s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2646.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'll come to you and Andrew [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2647.52s)]
*  for final word in a minute, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2650.36s)]
*  but Stacey, it just struck me as a question [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2651.28s)]
*  I wanted to ask you. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2653.2400000000002s)]
*  How do you feel about drug cheats in sport? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2654.5600000000004s)]
*  You know, when people are caught doping [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2657.6800000000003s)]
*  to enhance their performance, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2659.36s)]
*  how do you feel about that? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2660.8s)]
*  Obviously, you know how I feel about that. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2662.6800000000003s)]
*  You're baiting me to twist this around on the trans issue. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2665.36s)]
*  I have no idea how you feel about it. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2668.56s)]
*  I've never asked you. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2669.7999999999997s)]
*  I've never asked you before. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2671.2s)]
*  Obviously, I'm not in support of people [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2672.04s)]
*  taking drug enhancements to do better in sports. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2678.16s)]
*  But why? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2681.44s)]
*  Why are you not in support of that? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2682.44s)]
*  Given it just gives them an unfair advantage [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2684.24s)]
*  which you want for trans athletes. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2686.24s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2688.16s)]
*  I see exactly what you're trying to do [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2689.0s)]
*  and I'm not walking into it. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2690.16s)]
*  You know, like it's very clear [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2691.72s)]
*  where my stance is with trans people I don't support. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2694.08s)]
*  I just think that you're trying to walk me into something [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2699.12s)]
*  and it's not gonna work for me. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2701.7599999999998s)]
*  So you don't support the enhancement [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2705.48s)]
*  of performance through illegal drugs. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2708.44s)]
*  Okay, that's good. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2710.2799999999997s)]
*  We're halfway there I think. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2712.84s)]
*  Emily. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2714.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2715.52s)]
*  Pierce, I just wanna bring up a point that, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2716.36s)]
*  and personally, I don't know the stats. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2718.4s)]
*  I'd be very curious into looking into it, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2719.92s)]
*  but I think it would be remiss to not mention [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2721.56s)]
*  the fact that many, many women, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2725.96s)]
*  personally I know a bunch, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2728.24s)]
*  but I wanna see the stats on it, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2729.2799999999997s)]
*  are trying to have kids that are doing rounds of IVF, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2730.44s)]
*  spending all of their money that they've saved up [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2733.7999999999997s)]
*  trying to have a kid, are infertile, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2735.96s)]
*  are having miscarriages, never got their period. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2737.7999999999997s)]
*  I think we also have a really serious health crisis [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2740.44s)]
*  going on, at least in the United States. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2743.04s)]
*  I can't speak about the UK that Bobby Kennedy [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2744.92s)]
*  is very well aware of about hormones in the foods [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2746.88s)]
*  that are making it a lot harder for women [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2749.36s)]
*  to have children because I know many, many women [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2751.32s)]
*  who would love to have a big, beautiful family, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2753.44s)]
*  but can't even conceive their first child. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2755.48s)]
*  So I don't know if it's necessarily everyone [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2757.48s)]
*  making a decision to not have kids, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2759.6400000000003s)]
*  rather a health problem, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2761.88s)]
*  and I'd advise everyone to look into that too. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2763.04s)]
*  It's totally absurd. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2765.8s)]
*  First of all, the reason they need IVF [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2767.32s)]
*  and things like this, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2770.1600000000003s)]
*  because they defer families till they're in their 30s, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2770.98s)]
*  it's not healthy for women to start having babies [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2773.32s)]
*  in their 30s, not a great idea. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2775.48s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2777.28s)]
*  Yes, not only is it true. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2778.1200000000003s)]
*  I have a 24 year old friend who can't get pregnant. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2779.4s)]
*  I can statistically prove it. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2781.84s)]
*  The exception doesn't make the rule. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2782.68s)]
*  The truth of the matter is, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2784.7599999999998s)]
*  you can even look at infant mortality rates. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2785.96s)]
*  And in the United States, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2788.3199999999997s)]
*  we have some of the highest in the world, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2789.44s)]
*  and that is correlated directly to the fact [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2791.44s)]
*  that women are aged now, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2793.7599999999998s)]
*  aged out of their 20s when they're having children. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2796.0s)]
*  You can even see this in other nations as well. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2798.2s)]
*  Back over to the Turfs argument, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2800.5s)]
*  she says, well, wait a second, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2801.96s)]
*  we should really be deferring to women [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2804.44s)]
*  and incentivizing women for more stuff that women want. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2806.68s)]
*  We do this all the time. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2809.62s)]
*  We defer to everything that is that they want. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2811.1s)]
*  By the way, you have free tuition. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2814.1s)]
*  You do get all sorts of free healthcare. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2815.5s)]
*  And by the way, it's the poor people [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2818.02s)]
*  who have the most amount of children, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2819.74s)]
*  not the middle class or the rich who do family planning. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2821.2999999999997s)]
*  So this idea that you're just gonna give, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2824.2599999999998s)]
*  the idea that you're just going to give women money [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2826.42s)]
*  and that's going, or some type of support in this way, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2829.8199999999997s)]
*  and that's gonna be what moves them towards children, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2832.1s)]
*  it's not true. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2834.22s)]
*  Usually it's things like religion, religiosity, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2835.06s)]
*  your key component to traditionalism, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2838.7400000000002s)]
*  your idea of community has nothing to do with family leave. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2840.6600000000003s)]
*  It has nothing to do with that. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2845.1000000000004s)]
*  Never has the birth rate's been dropping like this, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2846.6600000000003s)]
*  like a rock, especially since the 1900s, right? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2849.06s)]
*  But even in the 1800s, but now, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2852.46s)]
*  since birth control especially, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2854.78s)]
*  and women's liberation, the sexual revolution, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2856.98s)]
*  it has dropped so drastically, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2859.6200000000003s)]
*  we can't even reproduce the population. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2861.82s)]
*  These aren't answers. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2864.34s)]
*  You're not answering any problems. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2865.82s)]
*  None. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2867.94s)]
*  It's just because of men like you. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2869.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2871.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's because of men like me, I know. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2872.3s)]
*  It's men like me. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2874.34s)]
*  The ones who actually reproduce, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2875.38s)]
*  it's because of men like me who actually reproduce. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2876.78s)]
*  I get it. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2878.62s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2879.62s)]
*  So what do you suggest? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2881.14s)]
*  Should women just start walking around [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2882.42s)]
*  and getting out there? Can you reproduce? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2884.14s)]
*  Do you even have a uterus to reproduce? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2885.54s)]
*  Do you even have a uterus to reproduce? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2888.1s)]
*  But anyway, what were you saying? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2890.06s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2891.38s)]
*  No, I just don't understand. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2894.14s)]
*  What do you think is the solution? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2895.26s)]
*  Women should just kind of settle in their young 20s [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2896.46s)]
*  and just start popping out babies, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2899.7400000000002s)]
*  even if they haven't necessarily met someone [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2901.02s)]
*  that's compatible for them yet or vice versa? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2903.54s)]
*  I thought you were in an anti-natalist language, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2905.38s)]
*  popping out babies. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2907.86s)]
*  Oh, they're slaves of the stove popping out babies. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2909.26s)]
*  No, I think that from a societal view, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2911.26s)]
*  we can have... [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2913.5s)]
*  I don't do that in the language. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2914.34s)]
*  We can have both natalists. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2915.18s)]
*  I've got to go. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2916.02s)]
*  I'm answering your question. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2916.86s)]
*  I've got to go. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2918.1s)]
*  I'm answering your question. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2918.94s)]
*  Sorry, everyone, I've got to go. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2919.78s)]
*  All right, listen. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2920.62s)]
*  You know what, Julie? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2921.46s)]
*  I'm actually, everyone's going to go [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2922.3s)]
*  because we've reached the end of the panel. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2923.82s)]
*  The only sadness for me is we can't all go [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2925.1s)]
*  and have a drink together [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2926.94s)]
*  because I think we'd all get on great over a few pints [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2928.14s)]
*  in a nice English pub, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2930.74s)]
*  but maybe we'll leave that as a treat for another time. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2R4S2JbDWU&t=2932.2599999999998s)]
