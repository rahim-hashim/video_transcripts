Video Description: Deadly flash floods in Texas have killed more than 100 people, with at least 160 still missing in a single county.
Frantic search and rescue operations are ongoing as Democrats attempt to tie the response to government cuts.

# “Release EVERYTHING!” Ted Cruz & Jeffrey’s Brother + Texas Floods Disaster
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY)
*  I think Jeffrey Epstein was a sexual predator. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=0.0s)]
*  Look, I want them to release everything. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2.56s)]
*  Every adult who was culpable and responsible, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4.08s)]
*  I think the public should know. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=7.2s)]
*  You think President Trump has something to do with Epstein, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=8.4s)]
*  with your brother being killed? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=11.36s)]
*  I wouldn't write that off. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=13.84s)]
*  I heard God killed those kids because they were using NordVPN, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  promo code destiny, to get around the Texas porn ban. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  On reflection, do you think that was a grotesquely tasteless thing to be posting? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=24.16s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=28.64s)]
*  The hand ringing here, oh my God, stop. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=30.0s)]
*  I'm not going to sit here and argue about jokes. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=33.12s)]
*  When these guys are spreading lies, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=35.28s)]
*  when it happens in LA, when it's about the wildfires, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=37.12s)]
*  I don't. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=39.28s)]
*  I'm not a sick, vile person like you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=40.32s)]
*  If you understood the size of the town, which you don't care [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=42.24s)]
*  because you're literally trying to make money off of dead people, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=45.2s)]
*  Google the size of the Comfort Texas City Hall. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=47.44s)]
*  You can't fit hundreds of people in any meeting there, you moron. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  What's up, everyone? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=55.44s)]
*  Well, Attorney General Pam Bondi is facing intensifying bipartisan pressure [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=56.64s)]
*  for the calamitous handling of the Epstein files. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=60.48s)]
*  Bondi claimed the so-called Epstein client list, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=63.2s)]
*  which many imagined as a record of high profile abusers he blackmailed, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=65.36s)]
*  was sitting on her desk. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=69.28s)]
*  The administration now says there is no list, there was no blackmail, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=70.48s)]
*  and that the release of prison videotapes proves he took his own life. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=73.76s)]
*  Well, that video skips forward by a full minute, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=77.12s)]
*  fueling even more speculation, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=79.2s)]
*  for which she offered this rather torturous explanation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=80.88s)]
*  The minute missing from the video, we released the video showing definitively [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=83.92s)]
*  the video was not conclusive, but the evidence prior to it was showing he committed suicide. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=91.04s)]
*  And what was on that, there was a minute that was off the counter. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=100.08s)]
*  And what we learned from Bureau of Prisons was every year, every night, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=103.36s)]
*  they redo that video, it was old, from like 1999. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=108.32s)]
*  So every night the video is reset and every night should have the same minute missing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=111.52s)]
*  So we're looking for that video to release that as well, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  showing that a minute is missing every night. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=119.92s)]
*  And that's it on Epstein. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=121.92s)]
*  That's not likely to be it on Epstein for Bondi or anybody else in administration. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=124.16s)]
*  For those who've demanded answers for years, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=128.24s)]
*  spurred on by the very people now in office who are saying there simply aren't any. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=130.56s)]
*  It's a fundamental issue of trust. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=134.48s)]
*  President Trump has made clear he's sick of it all. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=136.32s)]
*  I'll just interrupt for a second. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=139.68s)]
*  Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  This guy's been talked about for years. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=145.36s)]
*  You're asking, we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=147.84s)]
*  And are people still talking about this guy, this creep? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=153.12s)]
*  That is unbelievable. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  We are going to talk about this creep. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=159.52s)]
*  Later on, I'll interview his brother, Mark Epstein, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  who has some explosive insights onto the DOJ's conclusions. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  We'll begin with the utter devastation in Texas and the deadly flash floods [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=166.96s)]
*  that have killed more than 100, at least 160 still missing in a single county. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=170.24s)]
*  Frantic search and rescue operations are ongoing as we speak. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=175.12s)]
*  Democrats are attempting to tie their response to government cuts. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=177.76s)]
*  In a moment, we'll introduce the panel to debate all this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=181.28s)]
*  But first, I'm joined by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=183.76s)]
*  making his debut on Uncensored. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=186.48s)]
*  Senator, welcome to you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=188.4s)]
*  It appears great to be with you. Thank you for having me. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=190.0s)]
*  It's great to have you on. Thank you very much. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=191.76s)]
*  First of all, where are we with this? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=194.32s)]
*  We know that over 100 people have been very sadly killed here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=197.12s)]
*  We know that another 170 or more remain missing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=201.84s)]
*  Is there any hope at this stage, Senator, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=205.84s)]
*  do you think that you're going to find people alive? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=207.68s)]
*  Well, listen, there's always hope. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=211.44s)]
*  But obviously, the further along you get, every hour, every day, the odds go down. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=213.28s)]
*  The confirmed fatalities is over 100, as you noted. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=218.56s)]
*  There are 165 known people that are missing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=221.92s)]
*  We don't know everyone that's missing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=225.52s)]
*  One of the problems is this was the 4th of July weekend. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=226.96s)]
*  This is a very popular vacation spot. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=230.16s)]
*  You had people camping, people who don't live in Kerr County who came there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=232.72s)]
*  We're camping by the river. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=236.0s)]
*  We're celebrating the 4th of July. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=237.12s)]
*  You had people in RVs. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  We had RVs, dozens of them just swept into the river. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=240.56s)]
*  And so they don't have a complete list of who is missing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=244.08s)]
*  But it's just a question of systematic search. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  And it's both aerial search using helicopters, it's ground search. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=249.44s)]
*  There are teams that are systematically covering the area. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=253.52s)]
*  And then it's also using canines to discover. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=256.8s)]
*  Tragically, most of what is being discovered now are bodies of people who have deceased. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=260.56s)]
*  And of those 100, we know at least 29 of them were girls and counselors at Camp Mystic. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=265.68s)]
*  And I'll tell you, on Monday, I was there on the ground in the Hill Country. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=273.84s)]
*  I was at Camp Mystic. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=277.92s)]
*  I got to tell you what, I saw at the camp. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=279.44s)]
*  It may be the most horrible thing I've ever seen in my life. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=281.52s)]
*  The Guadalupe River is a beautiful river. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=285.44s)]
*  And just, I don't know if you've ever been in this part of Texas, Pierce. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=287.84s)]
*  Central Texas, it's the Hill Country. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=293.2s)]
*  And it's widely considered the prettiest part of the state. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  There are rolling hills and canyons and these gorgeous rivers. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=298.23999999999995s)]
*  And so you have lots of summer camps, about 40 summer camps. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=301.76s)]
*  Because it's a great place to vacation and kids. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=305.44s)]
*  I've been swimming in that river and floating in that river. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=308.0s)]
*  Dozens of times. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=311.2s)]
*  And normally it's beautiful and peaceful. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=312.16s)]
*  In the early mornings of July 4th, in the early morning hours, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=315.04s)]
*  over 1.8 trillion gallons of water fell on that river. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=319.12s)]
*  And it rose about 30 feet. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=323.92s)]
*  And at Camp Mystic, the cabins are hundreds of yards away from the river. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=326.0s)]
*  But it rose so fast that the girls' cabins had about 8 feet of water in them. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=331.6s)]
*  You could see the water line in the cabins. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=336.8s)]
*  And it swept all the furniture out. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=338.64s)]
*  It blew the windows out. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=341.2s)]
*  And tragically killed a significant number of campers, especially the younger ones. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=342.8s)]
*  There's one cabin right in the middle that was called the Bumble Inn. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  And it was a cabin of third grade girls. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=354.88s)]
*  And outside that cabin, there are 17 small white Latin crosses in the ground [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=357.68s)]
*  with the names of each of the girls on them. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=365.68s)]
*  And at this point, every girl in that cabin is either confirmed dead or is missing right now. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=368.16s)]
*  I'll tell you, two of those little girls go to school with my daughter. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  One of them lived literally a block away from me in Houston. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=380.24s)]
*  And so in Texas, our hearts are broken right now. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  This tragedy in the entire country, the entire world is watching every parent. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=389.68s)]
*  It's every parent's nightmare to lose a child in a tragedy like this. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=394.32s)]
*  And we appreciate the outpouring of love. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=398.64s)]
*  We appreciate the prayers from across the world for these moms and dads [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=400.8s)]
*  who are grieving with unspeakable pain. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=405.12s)]
*  It's a desperate story. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=409.04s)]
*  I've got a daughter of 13. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=410.56s)]
*  And obviously, the first thing you do, you just reflect on if that happened to you, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=412.32s)]
*  your family, to your friend. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=416.8s)]
*  It's just it is an unimaginable tragedy. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=418.24s)]
*  Let's just talk about the criticism that's come in, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=422.48s)]
*  leveled by some Democrats that somehow the blame for this can be directly associated to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=426.32000000000005s)]
*  doge cuts at the National Weather Service and so on. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=435.04s)]
*  You've had four days to look at this now. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=440.0s)]
*  From what you've seen, is there anything to suggest that anything more could have been done? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  And is there anything to suggest that any of the cuts that have either been made this year [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  or are due to come in later this year, could any of this process [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=453.76s)]
*  have had a negative detrimental effect, which if it hadn't happened, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=458.48s)]
*  could have stopped this tragedy being as bad as it is? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=462.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think there's any evidence that the doge cuts had had any connection to what happened [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=466.88s)]
*  here. There are obviously and absolutely things that could have been done better. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=471.76s)]
*  And those are questions we need to be asking right now. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=476.4s)]
*  Listen, whenever you have a natural disaster, whether a hurricane or a tornado or flooding, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=480.0s)]
*  you sometimes get partisans who try to score political points. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=486.88s)]
*  And if you see a hurricane, there are those on the left who'll say it's Donald Trump's fault, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=491.52s)]
*  no matter what happens. I think that's inappropriate. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=497.68s)]
*  I think we ought to be focusing on getting people out of harm's way. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=500.24s)]
*  With respect to the doge cuts, in this instance, the national weather service [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=504.56s)]
*  number one predicted this event, put out an emergency alert shortly after 1 a.m., [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=509.68s)]
*  shortly after 4 a.m. So those alerts went out. Number two, the office that had responsibility [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=514.48s)]
*  for this area was based in New Braunfels, which is also in central Texas right there. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  The night of July 3rd and the morning of July 4th, they were anticipating an extreme weather [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=525.52s)]
*  event. So not only were they fully staffed, but they had three additional staff members [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=530.88s)]
*  they brought in to prepare for that. So they had more than ample resources on the ground [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=535.2s)]
*  to deal with it. And in fact, if you look at the National Weather Service Union, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=542.24s)]
*  which has been very critical of the doge cuts, they don't like the doge cuts. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=546.8s)]
*  The National Weather Service Union has said publicly those cuts had no impact on [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=550.8s)]
*  hurting the National Weather Service's ability to predict this outcome. And so the union would [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=558.88s)]
*  have every incentive if they could blame it on the doge cuts to do so. And they're saying it's [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=564.4s)]
*  not. Now, in any natural disaster, there's an order to how things play out. The first priority [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=568.4s)]
*  is search and rescue, just getting people out of harm's way, saving lives. We are reaching the end [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=575.6s)]
*  of that period, but that has been the principal phase we've been in. The next phase is recovery. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=581.28s)]
*  And recovery and rebuilding, that takes months or years. There are homes that have been devastated, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=586.72s)]
*  billions of dollars. That's going to be an ongoing process. But the third thing that will play out in [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=592.48s)]
*  the next months and years, it is a careful retrospective, examining the precise timeline, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=598.0s)]
*  what happened, and asking what lessons can be learned, what can we do differently. And I'll say, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=604.72s)]
*  look, as an obvious matter, if you and I could step in a time machine right now, and we could [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=610.32s)]
*  go back to two in the morning on July 4th, we would both run to those cabins and get those little [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=614.72s)]
*  girls out of there. I mean, all of us wish those girls were not in harmed way. And we'd also run [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=621.04s)]
*  to the RV camps where all the people were sitting in RVs by the riverbank and get them out of there [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=627.12s)]
*  and remove, try to help the vulnerable people leave. And so one challenge when an alert goes [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=631.36s)]
*  out at one in the morning or four in the morning, most people are asleep at four in the morning. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=637.5999999999999s)]
*  And so I think it is a very reasonable question to ask, how can we be more effective at getting [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=642.64s)]
*  those alerts where people hear them? And one idea that's been discussed that I think makes a lot of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=649.04s)]
*  sense is having a system of sirens and alarms along the riverbank. You see that in parts of [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=654.7199999999999s)]
*  Texas where tornadoes are prevalent. A tornado like a flash flood can occur very quickly and that alarm [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=661.52s)]
*  can give you minutes to get out of harm's way. I think it makes a lot of sense to look at a similar [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  system here along the Guadalupia River. If you're stressed about back taxes, miss the April deadline, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=673.36s)]
*  or your books are a mess, well don't wait. The IRS is cracking down. Penalties add up fast, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=679.6s)]
*  five percent per month, and up to 25 percent for not filing. Tax Network USA can help. They've [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=685.52s)]
*  assisted thousands of Americans, from employees to business owners and people who haven't filed [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=691.6s)]
*  for years. They have direct access to powerful IRS programs and expert negotiators on your side. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=696.72s)]
*  Tax Network USA knows how to win. You'll get a free consultation and they may even be able [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=703.04s)]
*  to reduce or eliminate what you owe. So don't wait for the next IRS letter. Call 800-958-1000 [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=708.0s)]

*  Yeah because it seems to me there must be, I've not been to this region, it sounds utterly [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=725.92s)]
*  beautiful, friends of mine have been there, say it's just a staggeringly beautiful place. But as [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=732.0s)]
*  you say when an actual disaster like this happens, it happens very very quickly. I would imagine, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=736.64s)]
*  I don't know, but I've read reports suggesting a lot of the cell phone coverage can be patchy [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=741.52s)]
*  around there. So if you're getting a text message warning system that's going to be pretty unreliable [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=746.32s)]
*  and the the siren system it seemed to me, seemed to me a very logical thing which would have made [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=752.4s)]
*  a big difference. And I guess the question that comes following that train of thought is why was [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=757.84s)]
*  it not already in place? Yeah look I think that is a fair question. You know I'll say the cell phone [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=762.64s)]
*  coverage particularly in this part of Texas is very spotty. Like you, I have two teenage daughters [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=769.44s)]
*  and my girls have been going to camp in Kerr County in the hill country for a decade. Actually my wife [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=777.6s)]
*  Heidi was there picking up our youngest daughter Catherine the week before this happened. She had [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=783.84s)]
*  just finished camp and you know immediately when that, Catherine's 14, I'll tell you I just hugged [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=789.0400000000001s)]
*  her and Caroline when this happened because you just think there but for the grace of God go I. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=795.36s)]
*  That could easily have been our daughters and I've spent the last several days talking to moms and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=800.8000000000001s)]
*  dads who lost their daughters and just the agony of that. Not only do you have really lousy cell [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=807.04s)]
*  coverage there but for the camps and there are about 40 camps in Kerr County. This is a very [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=814.4s)]
*  popular place for both girls camps and boys camps. Almost all the camps make the kids leave their [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=818.64s)]
*  cell phones at home. So the kids by and large don't have cell phones which means you've got only the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=825.12s)]
*  counselors and a handful of adults that have cell phones and so we need to have and I expect [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=830.96s)]
*  at the local level, the state level and the federal level, I expect we're going to have very serious [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=836.88s)]
*  conversations about how we improve the emergency communication and response because obviously here [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=840.72s)]
*  we suffered a catastrophic loss of life. Senator you've been criticized by some that you're on a [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=848.48s)]
*  family holiday in Greece when this happened and that more than 24 hours after the Guadalupe River [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=854.16s)]
*  burst its banks you were seen with your wife lining up outside the Parthenon in Greece. I've [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=862.24s)]
*  seen your explanation. You were on a family holiday. You said you made immediate calls and you made [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=868.7199999999999s)]
*  plans to come back as soon as you could. I guess my one question for you as always as you know because [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=874.0s)]
*  you've had this situation before when you were on a family holiday once during a massive storm in [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=879.1999999999999s)]
*  Texas and got criticized for not coming back. With hindsight would you have preferred not to have been [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=884.08s)]
*  photographed queuing up to see the Parthenon? Would it have been a better optic not to have carried on [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=892.24s)]
*  doing holiday things? Listen in today's world you always have people engaging in political attacks [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=898.88s)]
*  and throwing rocks and I think that's unfortunate. I was on a pre-planned family vacation with my [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=907.12s)]
*  wife and daughters. We were already in Europe there when this occurred. You know I'll tell you [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=913.68s)]
*  most fourth of July's I try to go on vacation with my kids and spend time with my kids. That's [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=919.04s)]
*  the same is true of millions of people. When this crisis occurred it was horrific and we were watching [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=924.9599999999999s)]
*  the facts unfold. Within hours I was on the phone with Texas Governor Greg Abbott. I was on the phone [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=931.8399999999999s)]
*  with Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. I was on the phone with Nim Kidd who's the head of the [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=938.16s)]
*  Texas Department of Emergency Management and then I called President Trump and this was early on as [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=943.2s)]
*  the facts were still unfolding about the flooding and I told the President I said Mr. President we [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=948.96s)]
*  don't know all the facts yet. We don't know exactly what has happened but we know this looks bad. This [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  could be very very bad. There could be a very significant loss of life and I said we need to [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=958.48s)]
*  make sure that every federal resource and asset that we possible is deployed and the President [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=963.12s)]
*  said he said Ted anything Texas needs the answer is yes and so in the hours that this flooding was [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=969.2s)]
*  unfolding we had over a dozen helicopters in the air. We had Coast Guard helicopters in the air, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=975.6s)]
*  National Guard helicopters in the air and Texas DPS and we had game wardens. They carried out over [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=979.9200000000001s)]
*  850 high water rescues and so there was extraordinary heroism and now we're working hand in hand [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=985.84s)]
*  with families. I was within hours of this talking to parents whose daughters had gone missing. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=994.24s)]
*  We're working with state and local officials. We're working with FEMA to get federal resources there [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1000.88s)]
*  and so all of that if you're halfway around the world you do it by phone and then I got on a [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1006.0s)]
*  plane Sunday morning and flew back and it takes a whole day to get back and so I got in Sunday evening [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1012.8000000000001s)]
*  and was there by 7am Monday morning in Kerr County and spent the entire day there on the ground and [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1019.28s)]
*  so those who want to play politics that with this they can do that. My focus is on the crisis that [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1027.28s)]
*  is unfolding on the ground and doing everything we can to help those who are hurting right now in Texas. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1034.72s)]
*  It was reported and maybe you can just clear this up and eyewitness said that you as you were lining [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1039.6s)]
*  up for the path and that somebody walked past this eyewitness said that they said to you [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1044.64s)]
*  20 kids dead in Texas and you take a vacation. He sort of grunted and walked on. His wife shot me a [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1049.68s)]
*  dirty look. They continued on their tour guide. Did that conversation happen? Not that I know of but [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1055.2s)]
*  apparently this was some angry left-wing person who said that. I didn't hear anyone say that but [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1062.0800000000002s)]
*  apparently this individual believes they did. The grunt they heard from me. I had nothing to say [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1067.44s)]
*  about that. I did not hear anyone say that but listen we live in a world that is really polarized [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1074.32s)]
*  and so people engage in hate on both sides that I think is really unfortunate. One of the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1082.08s)]
*  consequences of serving in public life. Look I see lots of people and sometimes people say really [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1092.6399999999999s)]
*  good things. I sort of joke that people often will raise a finger to me. Sometimes it's a thumbs up. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1098.56s)]
*  Sometimes it's a different finger and that's just sort of the polarized world we live in. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1104.8s)]
*  But I wish both sides would show a little bit of grace and treat each other with more humanity. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1111.44s)]
*  So there are people on the Democrat side of the aisle I disagree with but I try very hard [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1120.6399999999999s)]
*  not to attack, not to demonize them. As you know I do a podcast every week called Verdict with Ted [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1127.2s)]
*  Cruz. We do the podcast three days a week and one of the things we do we've taken the podcast on a [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1132.3999999999999s)]
*  lot of college campuses and we'll have college students open it up to 90 minutes of Q&A. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1137.6s)]
*  And I'll tell you Piers my rule when we do that is I say look if you have a hostile question, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1144.3999999999999s)]
*  if you have an antagonistic question, come to the front of the line and we're going to have [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1148.8799999999999s)]
*  a constructive civil conversation. We may disagree but I think all of us need to talk [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1154.56s)]
*  to each other more rather than the world we live in now of just hating each other and throwing [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1160.32s)]
*  insults I think is really counterproductive. I totally agree and in fact funny enough when you [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1166.0s)]
*  had your sort of dust up as it was reported but actually it was a really interesting conversation [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1169.44s)]
*  between you and Tucker Carlson. I like that conversation. I think you should have robust [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1174.48s)]
*  conversations and all right it gets clipped up and things go viral and people take their [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1178.48s)]
*  tribal positions but actually you need more of that. People getting in a room and having [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1183.3600000000001s)]
*  sometimes polar opposite opinions but thrashing it out. You only came on to talk about the floods [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1188.64s)]
*  and I don't want to abuse that. I just can't given we're basically building the show around this. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1194.5600000000002s)]
*  I just wanted to ask you one question about something else. It's about these Epstein files. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1200.24s)]
*  A lot of people very angry that after being led to the water's edge of a belief by the [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1206.16s)]
*  administration there was going to be all this stuff coming out, client lists and so on and so on, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1212.8s)]
*  accountability that suddenly it seems the shutters have come down on this. A lot of people as you [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1216.8799999999999s)]
*  know on the conservative right and particularly in the MAGA world very very upset about this. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1222.4s)]
*  What's your reaction to it? Everybody knows how much I enjoy my tea and I'm very happy to say [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1227.76s)]
*  that today's show is sponsored by Peaks Pure Fermented Teas. These are not your average brews. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1234.88s)]

*  Look I wanted to release everything and I've called on that for a long time. I've called on [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1304.96s)]
*  that during the previous administration. The Biden administration did not release these materials. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1309.3600000000001s)]
*  I've called on this administration to release these materials. I think Jeffrey Epstein was a sexual [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1313.68s)]
*  predator. I think he targeted and abused young girls and all the evidence we have is there were [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1318.56s)]
*  a number of other men who participated in that and I want to know everyone who participated. I want to [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1324.72s)]
*  know everyone that went to to Epstein's Island and you know the attorney general has said that [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1330.16s)]
*  there are thousands of hours of videos of explicit videos and what she told me I asked her a couple [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1336.56s)]
*  of months ago what the delay was and what she told me then as she said the delay was that they're [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1342.72s)]
*  trying to go through those videos and make sure they're not releasing releasing images of of kids [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1348.48s)]
*  being sexually abused and I understand that you want to protect the privacy of the victim and [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1354.16s)]
*  and so that that and she just said that takes time. I think they should release every adult who was [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1358.32s)]
*  culpable and responsible. I think the public should know and I think they should be criminally [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1365.52s)]
*  prosecuted. I completely agree. Senator Cruz great to have you on our census for the first time. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1369.68s)]
*  Don't leave us alone next time. All right terrific thanks. Please send all our very best wishes. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1374.96s)]

*  Well I'm joined on the panel now by Natalie Winters, the White House correspondent, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1393.2s)]
*  Steve Bannon's war room, commentator and youtube host Brian Tyler Cohen, streamer and political [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1396.08s)]
*  commentator Destiny and Ben Ferguson the co-host of The Verdict with Ted Cruz. Well let me start [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1400.6399999999999s)]
*  with you Ben given that you work with with Senator Cruz a lot. A it was great to have him make his [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1405.84s)]
*  uncensored debut and obviously we focus mainly on the floods but what he said at the end there was [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1410.72s)]
*  really interesting I felt about the Epstein files because this is raging away you know the administration [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1415.1999999999998s)]
*  having got everybody very excited. You know I had one of the administration on uncensored. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1422.8s)]
*  Alina have let's just remind people what she told me literally like two three months ago. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1429.6s)]
*  It is incredibly disturbing. We have flight logs, we have information, names that will come out. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1434.96s)]
*  Is it going to be shocking? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1442.32s)]
*  I don't see how it's not shocking that there were so many individuals that were hidden [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1443.36s)]
*  and kept secret and not been held accountable. Let's talk about the reverse. I believe in [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1454.4799999999998s)]
*  accountability so you have to now go through your process. Now I won't say they're guilty until they [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1460.7199999999998s)]
*  go through their time in court but again now it's time for accountability. We have seen for so many [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1466.1599999999999s)]
*  years in this country many investigations, subpoenas, testimonies in congress etc etc [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1471.92s)]
*  but there's a general frustration with accountability. We take it halfway we don't [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1478.0800000000002s)]
*  take it home and I really believe that now with cash and Pam there will be accountability. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1482.0800000000002s)]
*  Ben that clip has had millions and millions of views this week understandably because there's [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1486.96s)]
*  a massive disconnect between what she told me there and what Pam Bondi was saying and what others were [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1491.28s)]
*  saying and what's actually materialized in the last 48 hours. You know Senator Cruz there very [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1496.88s)]
*  firmly that he wants everything put out and he wants criminal action taken against those who [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1503.1200000000001s)]
*  who broke the law. What's your view? I'm gonna agree more. Look I think there's transparency [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1508.72s)]
*  the American people deserve but not just the American people most importantly the victims. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1513.2800000000002s)]
*  They deserve to not have this be covered up in any capacity or for people to just stop looking. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1518.72s)]
*  I don't know if there's certain information that has disappeared or wasn't there that they thought [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1525.76s)]
*  was there but at the end of the day all that we do have needs to be put out there in a responsible [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1529.8400000000001s)]
*  way. You have to protect the victims that is something that's extremely important and so it's [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1536.88s)]
*  got to be done in an orderly way but there are too many people that have talked about this on the [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1542.4s)]
*  record saying that there's a lot of stuff out there to then all of a sudden say all right well [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1546.4s)]
*  maybe we don't have it maybe it's not there. Whatever the story is give it to everyone the [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1551.68s)]
*  same way and make sure you protect those victims but they deserve justice and I don't think this [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1557.68s)]
*  is going to be the end of this story. I think there's far too many people that are asking the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1563.1200000000001s)]
*  questions that you just mentioned that the Senator mentioned that I'm mentioning and this should be [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1567.44s)]
*  non-partisan this should be non-political. You have children that apparently were sex trafficked and [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1571.52s)]
*  abused in horrific ways that has nothing to do with politics. It should come out whether the people [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1577.52s)]
*  that were that were the perpetrators were liberal or conservative or agnostic it doesn't matter. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1583.68s)]
*  You need to protect the victims and we need to make sure things like this never ever ever ever [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1589.52s)]
*  happen again. Right Brian Tulloch-Owen I mean I do think it's a non-partisan issue obviously nothing [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1594.08s)]
*  is these days but I do think that it is completely baffling to me just as a journalist that you have [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1599.92s)]
*  this extraordinary scandal that rages away for many years the main perpetrator dies in prison [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1606.96s)]
*  and is believed to have taken his own life but the only person that's actually been made criminally [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1614.64s)]
*  accountable and is now languishing in prison is Gillian Maxwell his kind of madame figure [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1619.8400000000001s)]
*  who's a woman so none of the other men who are widely believed to have been involved in this [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1626.56s)]
*  none of them have been made accountable what's your view of this? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1632.24s)]
*  Yeah I mean my view is is that this was a this is a con job by this administration all of these [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1636.0s)]
*  people Cash Patel, Alina Habba, Dan Bongino, Donald Trump all of them came forward and said that this [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1641.92s)]
*  was a priority for them because they were stringing their supporters along and then the moment they [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1647.52s)]
*  get into power here we are in a situation where the the whole thing is just closed and we have no [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1651.68s)]
*  further information on this and yet you know look I think it would be fools to to to be surprised [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1657.6s)]
*  I mean this is a guy at Jeffrey Epstein who Trump himself palled around with for years this is a guy [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1662.8799999999999s)]
*  who Epstein himself called his closest friend for this is a guy who Jeffrey Epstein said was his [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1667.84s)]
*  closest friend for 10 years this is a guy who Donald Trump appointed as his secretary of labor [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1674.7199999999998s)]
*  Alex Acosta who who handed him a sweetheart deal a non-prosecution agreement where he was out of [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1680.0s)]
*  prison six out of seven days a week so or you know look Trump can say what he wants on the campaign [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1685.12s)]
*  trail in the lead-up when he needs to get everybody's votes and pander to the base but [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1690.9599999999998s)]
*  at the end of the day he's the guy in charge and suddenly the about face from everybody in his [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1695.12s)]
*  administration the buck falls to one person it's not Alina Habba or or Carolyn Levitt or Dan Bongino [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1699.76s)]
*  or Cash Patel it's Trump himself. Right I mean Natalie the interesting thing in terms of the [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1706.7199999999998s)]
*  timeline here is that when Elon Musk fell out pretty spectacularly and suddenly with Donald Trump [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1713.04s)]
*  one of the things he he posted on his ex-platform was you know bombshell the biggest bombshell is [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1720.1599999999999s)]
*  that Trump's in the Epstein files right and that was only a few weeks ago and since then there seems [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1727.68s)]
*  to have been a concerted effort for this story to just go away now these two things may be completely [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1733.68s)]
*  unconnected there may be nothing more to it other than Trump obviously was seen around Epstein they [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1738.8s)]
*  clearly were very friendly for a while I think he used his plane several times I don't think [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1744.6399999999999s)]
*  that's in dispute but there does seem to be a weird timeline here of Elon Musk saying that publicly [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1749.84s)]
*  and everything getting shut down a few weeks later but am I reading too much into this? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1758.3999999999999s)]
*  Well look I think this is very quickly approaching I mean we've already passed debacle territory but [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1763.44s)]
*  just outright grift and that's probably not something that you would expect me to say but [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1771.28s)]
*  this is just absolutely reprehensible I think if you look at what really the MAGA base the people [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1775.76s)]
*  who elected President Trump what their sort of concerns have been these past few months is that [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1780.72s)]
*  the administration is not moving fast enough right they're not content with the press releases [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1786.56s)]
*  in the tweets they want to see prison sentences and actual accountability for people that they [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1791.6s)]
*  believe committed crimes now we've hit the point where we're not getting even getting the press [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1796.08s)]
*  releases or the strongly worded letters we're getting weird undated unnamed memos being released [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1801.2s)]
*  over holiday weekends to legacy media outlets trying to bury it in Axios instead of working [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1807.76s)]
*  with all the new media outlets that the White House you know pumped and talked so openly and [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1813.28s)]
*  heavily about being in and around the White House I mean this is a bedrock issue I know I agree it's [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1817.52s)]
*  non-partisan it's non-political to want to get justice for the victims but I also think that this [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1823.52s)]
*  is something that is both hyper partisan and hyper political because what Jeffrey Epstein was doing [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1828.08s)]
*  whether it's a foreign intel operation or domestic aside or joint operation has direct ramifications [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1833.6s)]
*  and probably the policies that we've seen being rolled out whether through blackmail indirectly [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1838.96s)]
*  or directly through a lot of the political leaders in this nation I would just say as someone who [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1843.12s)]
*  has been on shows co-hosted with a lot of the people the clips that we've played of people who [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1847.36s)]
*  have called out Jeffrey Epstein for years and made millions of dollars off of it it is absolutely [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1852.32s)]
*  reprehensible and it is a complete grift and you have now and their words probably become the deep [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1857.6799999999998s)]
*  state if you're going to run cover for this and you think that the MAGA audience is dumb enough [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1862.6399999999999s)]

*  really really concerning moment for MAGA yeah I mean destiny is fascinating to see how a lot of [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1877.44s)]
*  the most die-hard Trump supporters in the kind of podcast YouTube influence the world they've turned [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1883.7600000000002s)]
*  pretty vengefully against him and the administration over this what do you make of it [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1890.72s)]
*  so here's the reality the reality is I keep hearing people like Joe Rogan saying the conspiracy [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1896.8000000000002s)]
*  theorists ended up being right about everything they weren't they were wrong about basically [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1901.2s)]
*  every single thing there was no massive election fraud there were no mass deaths from the COVID [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1904.56s)]
*  vaccine there is no evidence that it was manufactured in a laboratory there is no evidence that Jeffrey [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1909.6000000000001s)]
*  Epstein was murdered by somebody the reality is every single thing I said is true and I will [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1915.6000000000001s)]

*  have [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1924.8s)]
*  problem is that you guys spent so much time spreading these conspiracies that when you [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1934.08s)]
*  finally wound up when you finally wound up sir I don't even know if you know do you even believe [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1937.9199999999998s)]

*  everybody spent all this time with all these conspiracies and then as soon as they got into [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1967.2s)]
*  office and they no longer had a deep state to blame all of a sudden there was no election fraud [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1971.4399999999998s)]
*  evidence there was no evidence about Biden being conspiratorial you know with uh with uh Ukraine or [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1976.24s)]
*  Russia there was no evidence of Epstein being murdered and that's what's happened okay they are [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1982.24s)]
*  now the deep state they have every part of the government in our control and they have no evidence [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1986.08s)]
*  for any of the things that's it here's the problem here's the problem you've made a series of statements [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1988.88s)]
*  there alleging that all these things are pure conspiracy theories and there's no evidence for [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1992.32s)]
*  it and it is widely now accepted that actually it is more likely than not that the coronavirus [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=1997.44s)]
*  covid-19 was started in that lab that is now widely accepted that's not a conspiracy theory [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2003.84s)]
*  began as a conspiracy theory there is no scientific evidence there is no compelling [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2012.24s)]
*  intelligence can be that is the case so you think destiny to be clear [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2019.84s)]
*  let me finish my sentence here's the thing destiny you think it's literally a conspiracy theory [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2027.92s)]
*  that covid-19 which was originally said to have started in a wet market one mile from the Wuhan [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2034.0s)]
*  Institute of Virology where it later transpired they were testing new coronaviruses you think it [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2041.52s)]
*  is more likely it started with a bat in the wet market next door than it started in the lab where [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2047.44s)]
*  they're literally testing new coronaviruses you think that's a mad conspiracy because I would say [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2054.08s)]
*  I would say the mad conspiracy is that it's the bat a mile away I'm gonna I'm gonna go with the [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2060.0s)]
*  the wet market that was 30 minutes away in a densely populated city where all of the first [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2066.08s)]
*  cases started it's 30 minutes away Chinese Communist Party sir you are an absolute idiot [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2070.16s)]
*  I can't believe it's just to be clear just to be clear just to be clear that it's funny that you [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2078.3999999999996s)]
*  say Communist Party right just to be clear the residents of Kerr County for the floods that we [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2086.16s)]
*  were just discussing rejected utilizing ARPA funds for years to put up it's so funny Ted Cruz [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2090.24s)]
*  talked about an emergency siren system they didn't want to use money from the Biden administration [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2095.3599999999997s)]
*  because of all of these crazy conspiracies that you guys spread about things like COVID [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2099.6s)]
*  because they thought if they accepted the money the transcripts are public the transcripts are [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2103.2s)]
*  public sir I'm sorry are you telling me they didn't say that are you telling me they didn't [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2107.8399999999997s)]
*  say that we're kicking your ass and you made up something to try to go back and use kids that have [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2112.3199999999997s)]
*  died in a tragedy to cover the fact that you cannot defend your Wuhan point of view because [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2116.7999999999997s)]
*  it's made out of Chinese Communist propaganda I think everyone watching can see that now and I [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2122.08s)]
*  think you realize you stepped in it and you said something that wasn't true and everyone that has [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2128.32s)]
*  a brain on this panel is calling you out for it because it was such a stupid thing to say I'm [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2133.1200000000003s)]
*  sorry that happened to you but you don't use kids dying in a flood to try to cover for your dumbass [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2138.6400000000003s)]
*  comment oh my goodness oh by the way I want to bring the others in I want to bring the others [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2144.48s)]
*  into anywhere hang on hang on don't all shout out once so everybody can see who's running from it [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2149.36s)]
*  okay don't all shout out once let me bring Brian back in here see this is the interesting thing [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2153.04s)]
*  I think Brian I read what Joe Rogan put out about conspiracy theories he was really saying [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2158.16s)]
*  really what he was saying was don't just dismiss them all out of hand was his real theme about this [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2163.44s)]
*  because a lot of things are alleged to be conspiracy theories and the Covid lab one [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2168.0s)]
*  is a classic example well that began thank you as being something that could get people cancelled [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2172.16s)]
*  if they even dared suggest it and it's now you know the US CIA believes a research related origin [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2177.44s)]
*  in Wuhan in the lab is more likely than the theory it came from animals so the CIA now [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2183.44s)]
*  believe that so it's a longer conspiracy theory but Brian I think it goes to a wider point is that [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2188.88s)]
*  take the Epstein story right I don't know whether he took his life or was murdered or whatever [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2195.92s)]
*  it seems that most people who've looked at this professionally believe he took his life but there's [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2201.92s)]
*  this weird video with the missing minute and Pam Bondi's torturous explanation for what that may [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2207.44s)]
*  be about there's also the undeniable fact that he surrounded himself with a myriad number of [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2212.56s)]
*  famous rich powerful people who would have a vested interest in shutting him up that is [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2220.16s)]
*  indisputable there are also all these rumors flying around which you know even Alan Dershowitz thought [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2224.56s)]
*  there may be some merit to this when I interviewed him on Monday that he may have been some kind of [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2230.0s)]
*  Israeli Mossad agent of some sort you put all this together and again it's very easy to say well it's [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2234.72s)]
*  all a conspiracy theory to say that that he did anything other than he took his life and nobody [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2241.04s)]
*  else was involved there's no client list nobody else abused these girls it's over I don't think [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2247.12s)]
*  that's the conspiracy theory the conspiracy that's going on right now it seems to me is a conspiracy [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2252.96s)]
*  of shutting this down of silencing debate about it wanting to move on and for actually nobody [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2259.36s)]
*  other than Ghislaine Maxwell to be held accountable when it is I mean look take Prince [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2266.72s)]
*  Andrew right in my country Prince Andrew paid engineer Dufray a reported 11 million dollars [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2271.12s)]
*  right but claimed he never met her right but there's a photograph of him with his arm rounder when she [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2279.4399999999996s)]
*  was 17 18 in a London townhouse now you know call me a conspiracy theorist but you don't give 11 [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2284.9599999999996s)]
*  million dollars to someone you've never met right I don't care who you are so again a lot of the [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2292.24s)]
*  stuff swirling around here doesn't make a lot of sense and I don't think it's good enough for [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2298.3199999999997s)]
*  people just to say it's all conspiracy theory so shut up and move on your thoughts I would completely [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2302.9599999999996s)]
*  agree and in fact we saw yesterday when when when uh the White House was posed these questions [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2310.3999999999996s)]
*  Trump freaked out and said whoa whoa why are we still talking about this like can't we talk [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2317.76s)]
*  about something you've got Donald Trump who has spent every waking minute of the past almost [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2322.0800000000004s)]
*  decade talking about the water pressure in his shower and toilet that guy suddenly doesn't want [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2327.44s)]
*  to engage in a topic that he's spoken about before we've heard him go on and on about immigrants being [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2333.2000000000003s)]
*  rapists and murderers every day we've heard him go on and on for the better part of a decade about [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2338.48s)]
*  Hillary Clinton's crimes and the Biden crime family this guy repeats himself like to the ends [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2342.88s)]
*  of the earth and yet on the issue of Epstein which by the way was an issue that his campaign [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2348.6400000000003s)]
*  predicated so much of their focus on that that they garnered so much support from their audience [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2353.6800000000003s)]
*  based on now he doesn't want to talk about it so yeah I mean I guess the the expression that would [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2358.6400000000003s)]
*  come to mind is a hit dog will holler well also again I'll repeat this follows just literally [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2362.8s)]
*  whatever it was three four weeks ago Elon Musk in their big public spat suddenly posting you know [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2368.3199999999997s)]
*  the big bombshell is that Trump's in the Epstein file so it might be a move by the way that that [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2374.7999999999997s)]
*  that started a conversation about deporting Elon Musk in case you were wondering whether there was [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2380.3999999999996s)]
*  any there there so yeah I mean clearly that they he hit a mark by uh or he hit a nerve by saying [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2384.8799999999997s)]
*  stuff like that but but I mean for for this administration to try and brush it under the rug [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2391.4399999999996s)]
*  and and Natalie I do agree with what you said about there being a lot of grifters I mean we've [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2396.24s)]
*  seen Dan Bongino and Cash Patel focus so much energy so many resources so much time on this [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2400.3199999999997s)]
*  exact issue only for them to come out and say oh well there's uh you know there's absolutely [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2407.12s)]
*  nothing here but but I would also caution Natalie to not put the onus because I've been seeing this [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2411.68s)]
*  more and more on the right to not put all of the the responsibility on Pam Bondi Pam Boddy is an [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2416.4799999999996s)]
*  appendage of Donald Trump she is not calling the shots nobody in this administration is calling [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=2421.68s)]

*  cleared out and the massive warnings that were coming we did that we also talked about what the [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3333.84s)]
*  fire chief said about those warnings we talked about the lack of water pressure we talked about [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3337.6s)]
*  then cleaning up some of the holding tanks we talked about also the fact that there were certain [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3341.7599999999998s)]
*  things that were done to save fish over having the ability to fight these types of fires and [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3345.84s)]
*  everything that went into it we talked about the decisions that were made that then made for a poor [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3350.64s)]
*  response that made you have to be on your roof as you described it spraying down because there wasn't [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3355.7599999999998s)]
*  adequate decisions that were made you think the reason that I was on my roof underbrush you think [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3361.7599999999998s)]
*  the reason that I was on my roof was because while the Santa Ana winds were ripping through LA at 100 [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3366.96s)]
*  miles per hour and 50,000 acres of LA were burning that some some some bogus fucking story about the [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3371.92s)]

*  what you're talking about I'm quoting the people in your government of California there is no Ben [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3388.0s)]
*  there is no amount of water pressure in the world through these hydrants that are going to be able [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3392.4s)]
*  to put out 50,000 acres of fire I didn't say that yes you did you're talking about smelt and you're [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3396.56s)]

*  you don't deserve it and you're just going to spew a bunch of bullshit about smelting water [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3415.44s)]
*  pressure okay brother but let me let me grant you the larger point and say that there are still [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3419.36s)]
*  things that people could do and I'm not here to argue that California did a perfect job or does a [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3423.36s)]
*  perfect job with regards to how they manage all of this stuff but to that point then do you think [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3428.88s)]
*  it's maybe a little stupid that Trump would fire 10% of Noah's workforce which is about 1300 staffers [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3434.8s)]
*  and researchers do you think it's a good idea then that Trump called for reducing Noah's workforce [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3440.5600000000004s)]
*  force by a further 17% which would be another 2000 staffers and researchers do you think it's [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3445.84s)]
*  a good idea that Trump slash 20% of FEMA's workforce do you think it's a smart idea to [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3451.36s)]
*  phase out FEMA completely do you think it's a smart idea that 25% of NWS is let me respond [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3456.2400000000002s)]

*  if you're asking about the size of government and the president making a decision to reduce the size [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3468.08s)]
*  of government when it makes sense I have no issue with that by the way the staffing and the lies [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3473.92s)]
*  that were put out by many on the left in the media was that there was understaffing when it came to [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3479.28s)]
*  the warnings that were coming out from the national weather service that was a lie they were staffed [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3483.76s)]
*  above normal staffing levels they held people over the day before in the night of the storm in [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3489.6s)]
*  Texas they had double the staff on staff when the storms were hitting there's a timeline of all the [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3495.2s)]
*  texts that were going out and the warnings that were going out and so you're acting as if Donald [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3501.68s)]
*  Trump caused a problem with the flood and the response to it in the warning system which is a [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3506.96s)]
*  lie when you have double the staff which is the protocol by the way under Obama under Biden [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3513.2s)]
*  and under George Bush so this is non-partisan and everyone showed up for work and people were held [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3519.28s)]

*  probably the textbook definition of what it means to be a grifter trying to profit off of [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3545.68s)]

*  to stop the jews from putting clouds in the sky so thank god we have you guys working hard on the [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3729.2s)]

*  3am and watch the internet thank you god thank you god okay brian um let's just talk on a bigger [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3737.92s)]
*  picture about uh because it's interesting to me the whole epstein thing for example [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3747.12s)]
*  I think has been fueled the sequence of events by what elon musk put on on x and he's now creating [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3752.48s)]
*  a third party he says he is the america party uh it's never worked before but we've never had [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3759.52s)]
*  somebody with his money or social media firepower to drive it so I don't think it should be [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3765.28s)]
*  dismissed out of hand how dangerous an enemy can elon musk turn out to be for donald trump if for [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3770.4s)]
*  example in the midterms he decides to aggressively support you know anti-trump candidates for example [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3777.84s)]
*  and is successful in doing that um and gets some resonance for this party this third party and then [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3787.1200000000003s)]
*  that moves forward with some momentum to a general election I mean you know how big could this get um [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3792.96s)]
*  what's your feeling about the musk trump meltdown I think it could go both ways you could make the [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3800.0s)]
*  argument that the reason trump is president right now is because elon musk gave him 300 million [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3805.76s)]
*  dollars and uh and campaign relentlessly in pennsylvania for example so obviously there is [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3809.92s)]
*  there is a lot of uh a lot of weight that can be given to a candidate by virtue of endless funds [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3815.6s)]
*  elon has that on the flip side look I mean he he put forward this threat that he was going to make [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3820.4s)]
*  sure that whoever voted for the big beautiful bill was primaried they all voted for it except for [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3827.1200000000003s)]
*  thomas massey and uh you know um uh tom tillis and so they were not going to vote for it anyway [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3832.48s)]
*  I'm sure that they're I'm sure that elon's and ran paul had had and ran paul to elon's tweet had no [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3838.7200000000003s)]
*  bearing on any of those three and so you couldn't also make the argument at the same time that that [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3844.1600000000003s)]
*  that his that his influence is waning in the republican party I think what's what's the the [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3850.2400000000002s)]
*  broader picture though is that you know this is this is uh elon is somebody who has you know [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3855.76s)]
*  elon himself is no white knight here especially as it relates to to democrats this is somebody [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3862.32s)]
*  who you know predicates so much of his focus on eliminating waste fraud abuse which by the way so [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3867.36s)]
*  do the republicans but everyone is full of shit here elon had carte blanche full reign of government [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3872.48s)]
*  with doge and instead of going after the biggest agency in government which has failed seven audits [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3877.6s)]
*  which is the pentagon he goes after USAID which is one half of one percent of the budget and [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3882.4s)]
*  affords us soft power without firing a single bullet across the world he goes after the consumer [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3887.52s)]
*  financial protection bureau which which um saved you know uh billions of dollars for 200 million [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3892.3199999999997s)]
*  consumers that is a fraction of the budget he goes after the EPA the NLRB the department of labor [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3898.96s)]
*  the department of transportation every single agency that had enforcement or fines levied against [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3904.64s)]
*  him are the ones that he focused on and instead the pentagon gets a raise to a trillion dollars [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3909.2799999999997s)]
*  so spare us on the grandstanding about reigning in uh uh deficit uh reigning in the the federal [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3916.0s)]
*  deficit but the same goes for this republican party all of these people house freedom caucus [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3922.4s)]
*  included predicated so much of their identity on this idea that they were gonna that that we have to [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3926.8799999999997s)]
*  stop this existential threat that is that is overspending and and saddling our kids and future [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3932.9599999999996s)]

*  motherfuckers voted for it all of these people are completely full of shit they string their people [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3943.52s)]
*  along just like they did with the Epstein situation they strung all their supporters along with these [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3948.9599999999996s)]
*  promises that they're going to be the fiscal responses that they're going to be the the fiscal [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3953.6s)]
*  conservatives that they're going to be the adults in the room they get into office they explode the [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3957.04s)]
*  deficit because the only priority they have not Epstein not lowering costs not adding jobs none of [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3961.36s)]
*  that stuff it is giving themselves a tax cut that's the only long-standing principle they have it's [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3968.1600000000003s)]
*  all they did in 2017 it's all they're doing right now everything else is window dressing to calm [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3973.92s)]
*  their supporters their marks into thinking that they're going to help them all right let me say [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3979.52s)]
*  this about about him real quick eon musk and how this could be an issue you you go back and you [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3983.6s)]
*  look at guys like jesse ventura you go back and and you look at swartz nigger you go back and you [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3988.08s)]
*  look at ross perot there is a history that when certain individuals see an opportunity and a third [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=3993.6s)]
*  party comes about that you can be a disruptor if elon musk just wants to be a disruptor in the [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4000.3199999999997s)]
*  midterm elections there is no doubt he can pull it off if he's smart about where he plays if he [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4007.7599999999998s)]
*  tries to play nationwide i think that would fall apart but look there's a tight majority in the [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4012.88s)]
*  house a tight majority in the senate the senate is leaning more towards the democrats in the [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4017.12s)]
*  upcoming midterm election it favors them in the election map and who's up uh yeah i think elon [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4021.52s)]
*  musk if you want to go in there and be a disruptor to donald trump he certainly has the money to do [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4026.96s)]
*  it it's not just money it's not just money because he also he also has 200 million followers on his [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4032.16s)]
*  own social media platform sure that that i think i think that played a big part in how trump won [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4037.7599999999998s)]
*  i think you got a lot of people to on a daily basis elon musk was all in on trump [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4043.92s)]
*  yeah but but at the end of the day i think elon musk is a really smart guy i've spent time with [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4049.28s)]
*  him interviewed him i think he's probably going to look at this and say hey i want to rein in some [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4053.6800000000003s)]
*  of these things i want you to hold true uh the republican party to what you claimed you were [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4059.2000000000003s)]
*  going to do going back to the point that was just made a moment ago by the guests he wants to make [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4064.08s)]
*  that the people that help get this power continue to do the right thing more often than they go and [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4068.7999999999997s)]
*  do other things and so this is that shot across the bow yeah i understand why he's doing it [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4074.9599999999996s)]
*  it does concern me that you end up blowing up the entire thing and the progress you've made [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4080.72s)]
*  we'll have to see how it plays out destiny is there anything intrinsically wrong in the concept [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4084.7999999999997s)]
*  of a third party would it help help break the kind of you know very long-running intransigent nature [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4089.6s)]
*  of the american political system i mean with most people the math problem is that if you create a [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4096.72s)]
*  third party all you're doing is siphoning votes off from another party that you're more likely [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4101.84s)]
*  to agree with but elon might have a special advantage because in 10 or 15 years it's projected [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4105.280000000001s)]
*  that 50 to 100 000 of his children could vote for him in an election so maybe that'll swing [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4109.92s)]
*  things a different way you know that's to see that is a funny joke destiny you've got it in you [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4114.240000000001s)]
*  naturally the republicans have it their way if there are all those kids are in texas who knows [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4120.96s)]
*  how many will be gone to natural disasters that could have never been uh you know prevented or [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4124.4s)]
*  screened for or anything else so there you go i'll make it offensive you know what i felt about the [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4127.839999999999s)]
*  the debate part of that was what senator cruise told me i thought was was a good way of describing [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4132.08s)]
*  it he said look actually probably the big problem here the only thing that might have made any [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4138.24s)]
*  difference is if more people had been able to heed an alarm faster it might have saved some lives [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4143.12s)]
*  because it happened so fast and it's so devastating and the truth is it's in an [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4151.12s)]
*  aero apache cell phone a lot of people wouldn't have got the messages and had they had a siren [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4155.5199999999995s)]
*  system it might have saved some lives i imagine they will now all get siren systems and that's [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4161.2s)]
*  can i ask you a question on on that point and and that is like look look notwithstanding the fact [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4166.24s)]
*  that that republicans have spent so much money handing themselves a tax cut but ice now has a [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4171.5199999999995s)]

*  he might be getting deported imminently so it'll be a tough running the america party from south [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4376.0s)]
*  africa okay on that note we will leave it i'm going to go in and have my ears treated by an [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4380.719999999999s)]

*  thank you good to be here if i could we spoke about a year ago if i could just ask you first [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4400.16s)]
*  of all your reaction to the trump administration effectively saying it's now shutting down [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4406.16s)]
*  any ongoing investigation into the epstein files as they put it what is your reaction to that [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4413.28s)]
*  well you know i've never really been that much involved with or cared about the epstein files [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4420.719999999999s)]
*  as far as the charges against them i had nothing to do with that i wasn't part of it as i explained [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4426.72s)]
*  last time my concern is the fact that he was most likely killed in prison that's what i'm concerned [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4431.52s)]
*  about and uh the fact that they're trying to hide that or trying to shield that and trying to put it [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4436.88s)]
*  off as a suicide where everything else points against suicide that's what i'm concerned about [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4442.320000000001s)]
*  there's been a lot of every time they say something or do something like release this video [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4448.56s)]
*  it's just digging themselves deeper into the hole it seems like the lies are closing in on them [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4453.76s)]
*  so explain to to the viewers exactly why you believe your brother didn't take his own life [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4458.96s)]
*  and somebody else took it okay well first of all when i first heard that he was dead from the parent [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4465.2s)]
*  suicide i had no reason to doubt it i figured well you know he's in prison what he was facing [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4471.68s)]
*  you know he didn't have children a lot of that parents are gone i figured okay if he decided to [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4476.64s)]
*  take himself out i would just respect that but then you know we did the autopsy the next day and [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4480.64s)]
*  the city pathologist who did the autopsy with dr bottom there they both came out of the autopsy [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4486.160000000001s)]
*  room and they said that they couldn't call it a suicide because it looked too much like a homicide [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4492.8s)]
*  that wasn't my suggestion that was them the professionals you know and then uh you get all [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4497.92s)]
*  the things that went wrong in the prison you know the cameras weren't working on the maximum security [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4503.6s)]
*  tier uh the guards were only checking there's just a lot of things that went wrong in the prison [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4508.4s)]
*  and then uh you know jeffrey was trying to appeal his bail decision and he had a hearing coming up [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4514.16s)]
*  and it would have been an extremely large bail that he was offering and that hearing was coming [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4522.5599999999995s)]
*  up soon now i i know jeffrey and i thought that if he was had a chance of getting bail he would wait [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4527.28s)]
*  to commit suicide to see if he if bail was denied it would make it more plausible that he killed [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4535.12s)]
*  himself but why would he kill himself literally days before he had a chance of getting bail that [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4539.92s)]
*  doesn't make any sense that's another thing and then when you hear the statements that come out [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4545.12s)]
*  like when bill bar first said he saw the videotape and he saw that nobody went in or out of the tier [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4550.32s)]
*  because the camera outside of the tier was working he said no one went in or out of the tier that [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4556.4s)]
*  convinced him it was a suicide well that was a blatantly naive statement from the top law [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4562.0s)]
*  enforcement official of the united states because there were 12 11 to 12 other prisons on that tier [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4566.64s)]
*  that could have killed somebody on the tier and also conversely to think somebody could get to [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4573.12s)]
*  that door go inside kill somebody and leave through that door completely undetected is just asinine [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4578.16s)]
*  because there's six levels of security before you get to that door so that if he was killed it [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4585.44s)]
*  wasn't by somebody going into the tier and coming out of the chair with somebody already on the [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4590.24s)]
*  tier or he was killed when they locked up the tier at 10 o'clock at night or 10 30 at night [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4594.719999999999s)]
*  night before let me just remind viewers we have this conversation a year ago but just for the [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4599.92s)]
*  record do you believe that your brother was guilty of very serious sex crimes [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4604.24s)]
*  the only thing i know he was guilty of is that he was with girls that were too young [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4614.16s)]
*  do all the other crimes and accusations i have no no clue i was involved that wasn't there i hadn't [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4620.719999999999s)]
*  seen jerry for a number of years before his death and i mean we were always in communication by a [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4626.8s)]
*  phone or email but we didn't he lived two you know separate worlds so i had no idea what he was doing [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4632.0s)]
*  so yeah that's the only thing i could say i know he was guilty of the other stuff is not my business [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4638.5599999999995s)]
*  i wasn't involved i don't know what the charges are so i'm only concerned with the circumstances [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4642.5599999999995s)]
*  death and had you been in contact with him when he was in prison when he was in prison no [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4648.64s)]
*  the last contact i had with him was the night before he got arrested he was in paris [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4656.64s)]
*  he called me from paris that night just a normal brotherly cause you know check up on each other [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4661.6s)]
*  and then the next day he flew home to me to teterboro airport he was arrested at the airport [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4666.72s)]
*  his attorneys called me and told me he was arrested the last conversation i had with [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4672.64s)]
*  jeff was the night before he was arrested he was obviously convicted of a pedophile crime [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4677.52s)]
*  many years previously did did he ever it was a negative prostitution or involving prostitution [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4684.4800000000005s)]
*  or something that was in slobber in like 2006 or something with an underage girl though [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4691.6s)]
*  yeah i believe so yeah yeah so that that's a crime i mean that's that's that made him a pedophile [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4697.04s)]
*  he said he's in jail for that yeah so so i guess my question is as his brother after that did you [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4703.280000000001s)]
*  have any discussions about about that criminal offense that he was found guilty of i told him [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4710.160000000001s)]
*  to make sure that any even the future face with girls that are not underage what seems very clear [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4716.96s)]
*  is that he ignored that advice and carried on uh having all these girls many of whom wait i got to [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4724.8s)]
*  stop you i don't know about that because from what i understand what he was being charged with more [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4731.76s)]
*  recently was stuff that took place back then i haven't heard of charges since that 2006 2006 [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4736.72s)]
*  or 2008 whenever he got out i haven't heard of charges that he was with underage girls after [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4743.92s)]
*  that i haven't heard that maybe he was but i i didn't hear charges about that like i said the [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4748.8s)]
*  charges i was aware of took place back then and part of his i know part of his defense was going [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4754.64s)]
*  to be that when he made that deal back in 2006 he had a non-prosecution agreement with the government [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4760.32s)]
*  after that so it seemed like they were trying to prosecute him for things that he was supposed to [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4767.2s)]
*  have been you know safe from so i don't like that i don't know if he was with i don't know if there's [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4771.44s)]
*  charges that he was with underage girls after you know 2006 that episode but obviously you will know [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4777.28s)]
*  the same things that we've all read about your brother which is that uh he had this island he [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4783.5199999999995s)]
*  took a lot of underage girls there a lot of them have made very serious allegations about being [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4789.44s)]
*  raped and sexually assaulted and abused and the other rich powerful people men were also involved [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4795.839999999999s)]
*  none of whom have been brought to justice what do you feel about that well i think if that was the [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4804.0s)]
*  case that we would have heard about some of these men why why aren't these victims called victims why [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4811.04s)]
*  aren't they naming names well the suggestion is that there's been a well the suggestion is margo [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4817.44s)]
*  there's been a big cover-up to prevent those names being released well but you know people know who [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4824.5599999999995s)]
*  these victims are the attorneys know who these victims are they could come out and say it you know [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4831.04s)]
*  i mean the trump administration now says case closed do you think it should be closed or should [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4838.879999999999s)]
*  there be further investigation to establish exactly who who else may have been involved [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4844.4s)]
*  well again i'm not concerned about that to be honest with you i mean if the wrongdoing was [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4850.32s)]
*  done people should be punished but i don't know that wrongdoing has been done i know that i'm [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4854.48s)]
*  concerned about my brother's likely murder the trump administration the trump well mark the [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4858.879999999999s)]
*  trump administration is also making it very clear that from all their investigations they believe [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4867.679999999999s)]
*  it is indisputable and 100 certain that your brother took his own life well yeah because who [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4873.76s)]
*  are they protecting look when when bill bar made the statement about no one you know it was a [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4882.16s)]
*  suicide because no one went in or out when cash patel makes a statement saying that you know a [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4887.6s)]
*  suicide when you see it my question to him was how many suicides have he seen okay where you take [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4892.64s)]
*  dr roman and dr barton who did the actual autopsy and they came out of the autopsy and they said this [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4898.32s)]
*  looks more like a homicide than a suicide then how does the trump administration say overrule that [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4904.639999999999s)]
*  dr barton has done about 500 autopsy on prison suicides over the last 50 years he's been you know [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4911.76s)]
*  there's very few people with that kind of experience and he's saying that to him this was not a suicide [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4918.5599999999995s)]
*  it's a homicide so yeah anyone in the trump administration could say i don't think so [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4924.24s)]
*  but what's their backing like like i said when cash patel said you know a suicide when you see it [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4929.5199999999995s)]
*  how many suicides has he seen is he a uh a forensic pathologist is he a doctor you know it's a it's a [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4935.76s)]
*  it's a laughable matter that he can come out social where months ago he was saying that it wasn't uh [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4944.48s)]
*  that it wasn't a suicide what is your message mark to president trump let me finish you got [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4950.24s)]
*  bondy you got patel you got bach all of these people work for trump okay so if they're covering [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4958.16s)]
*  up for somebody who do you think they might be covering up for so you think they're covering up [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4964.719999999999s)]
*  for president trump everybody is looking at little pieces of this and coming up with kind of theories [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4970.4s)]
*  but people really take the time because there's a lot of facts there's a lot of information people [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4976.48s)]
*  who take the time and really investigate this thoroughly all come to the pretty much conclusion [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4982.0s)]
*  that maybe trump was behind this wow that means maybe maybe jeff was killed to quiet them [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4987.679999999999s)]
*  you think you think president trump has something to do with with ebbs team with your brother being [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=4996.48s)]
*  killed i wouldn't write that off because if you look at all of the evidence we have and all of the [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5000.88s)]
*  facts not opinions and all of the facts it that wouldn't be something i would dismiss i mean that's [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5009.36s)]
*  an extraordinary thing to say but there is there is zero evidence that donald trump had anything to [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5018.0s)]
*  do with your brother's death well somebody did that who again if you look at the it sort of may [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5022.08s)]
*  be circumstantial but if you look at all the people trying to make it look like a suicide look [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5029.6s)]
*  they just released a video of the door you know up to the tier and they're trying to make people [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5034.96s)]
*  think that that was the door to the cell showing that nobody went in or out of the shell the video [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5040.08s)]
*  that was recently released was a door to the tier the one that bill barry referred to now here's an [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5045.04s)]
*  interesting fact i asked years ago to the videotape from that very camera from 10 o'clock at night [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5050.8s)]
*  tonight before until noon the morning that he was found because that would show who the last people [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5060.400000000001s)]
*  on the tier were when they left and locked up the tier and would also show the condition and the [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5066.8s)]
*  circumstances when they took his body off of the tier to the infirmary i also want to see the video [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5071.6s)]
*  from the infirmary i haven't been able to get anything i was initially told [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5077.44s)]
*  that i couldn't get it because it was an active investigation so i couldn't get access to it [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkPi6rScVHY&t=5081.36s)]
