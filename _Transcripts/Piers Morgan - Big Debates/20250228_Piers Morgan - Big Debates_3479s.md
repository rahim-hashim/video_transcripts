Video Description: One of the most astounding parts of President Donald Trump’s reelection was the alternate reality that the leftwing establishment constructed for their supporters; and frankly, their donors. If the Democratic machine was to be believed, Kamala Harris’ chances of victory were good to great. But even after having a month to coalesce, leftwingers still seem dazed and confused. Joy Reid was completely blindsided by the cancellation of her show, and Jake Tapper’s new book on the ‘cover-up’ of Joe Biden’s mental decline is receiving criticism after he blasted Lara Trump in an interview for pointing it out.

So what now? Who has it in them to chart a new course for the liberals of America? To tackle this very subject, Piers Morgan assembles 'The Young Turks' co-host Ana Kasparian, Trump’s former press secretary Sean Spicer, 'Night School' host Marc Lamont-Hill, host of 'Fearless with Jason Whitlock' Jason Whitlock and co-host of 'Steve Bannon's War Room' and White House correspondent Natalie Winters on Uncensored.

# 'RACE BAITER!' Joy Reid FIRED & Jake Tapper Hypocrisy | With Sean Spicer
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU)
*  My show had value and that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm sorry both of our non-white hosts in primetime are losing their shows single-tier white woman tears [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=4.96s)]
*  Happening right here. So let me just say to Megyn Kelly go fuck yourself [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=12.56s)]
*  I think Joy Reid is one of the biggest race baiters in the history of American television [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=16.04s)]
*  There's only so many times you can you know play that schtick over and over again without people getting tired of it [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  Frankly if Joy Reid were white and the tables were flipped. I'm sure she would last about all of one show [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=27.42s)]
*  I think audiences start to become more cynical about where they're getting their information [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=32.34s)]
*  The whole attack on her network was predicated on an absolute false suit. No black people are not interchangeable [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=37.980000000000004s)]
*  And so I can't say well, I got rid of peers, but here's another one [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=44.540000000000006s)]
*  President Trump's election victory was propelled by new media [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=49.660000000000004s)]
*  But he still has his sights firmly set on settling scores of the legacy press ABC News [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=52.34s)]
*  ABC News paid 50 million dollars to settle a defamation suit [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=57.540000000000006s)]
*  Paramount may now settle a 20 billion dollar lawsuit over a 60 minutes interview with Kamala Harris [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=61.1s)]
*  But Trump says was edited to make it look smarter and this week MSNBC fired Joy Reid [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=65.86s)]
*  One of Trump's fiercest critics who is best known for commentary like this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=70.94s)]
*  The race lady. Why would he call me that? Is this really about me fixating on race or is it about you? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=75.5s)]
*  Fixating on race Donald Trump wants to never let black and brown folk up off the mat evident what they mean by DEI, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  Why don't just say what you mean? You can't stand black people. We get it. You've been heard [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=89.42s)]
*  Are you committed to naming a black woman as your vice presidential running mate? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=93.62s)]
*  They wanted to go after the brown people too, because of course that is their other target [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=97.94s)]
*  Well now Donald Trump has sparked uproar among DC journalists by taking control of the official press pool [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=102.38s)]
*  The White House Correspondence Association has decided who gets special access to presidential events and therefore one for more than a century [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=107.18s)]
*  But now the White House itself will make the final call [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=113.7s)]
*  Promising to add podcasters and streamers to the rotation and in a bombshell announcement Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=115.94s)]
*  So the newspapers opinion pages will now be limited to the defense of only two things personal liberties and free markets [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=122.34s)]
*  Trump supporters say mainstream media is blatantly catching up with public opinion as it fights to remain relevant [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=129.06s)]
*  Critics say it's a chilling assault on the free press [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=134.70000000000002s)]
*  We'll head to debate all this executive producer and host of the Young Turks, Anikis Berian [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=137.34s)]
*  The former White House press secretary and host of the Sean Spicer show, Sean Spicer [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=141.5s)]
*  The host of Met News, Mark Lamont Hill and from Fearless with Jason Whitlock, Jason Whitlock. Well, welcome to all of you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=145.66000000000003s)]
*  Um, let me start [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=152.54000000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry. I've missed one [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=154.22000000000003s)]
*  But at last and by no means as unimportant as I may have just made you seem [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=156.78s)]
*  Natalie the co-host and White House correspondent for Steve Banner's war room Natalie Winters, uh unusually [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=161.74s)]
*  There are five of you because we we just knew you'd all be brilliant. So we're having you all today [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=166.78s)]
*  So Natalie welcome to you as well. Um, okay, let's get into this. Um, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=170.46s)]
*  Jason Whitlock [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=175.02s)]
*  It seemed to me watching MSNBC rarely because I found it bad for my blood pressure that Joy Reid was just about the single [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=176.62s)]
*  biggest [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=185.26s)]
*  worst race beta [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=186.22s)]
*  In the history of American cable news and it's not even close. Um your thoughts [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=188.22s)]
*  Totally agree with you uh peers, uh, Joy Reid's job [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=196.86s)]
*  as a lot of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  black women [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=203.26s)]
*  On MSNBC or CNN [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=204.86s)]
*  It's their job to define everything along racial lines and to continue to explain to the American public [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=207.1s)]
*  That if you disagree with the Democratic Party you're racist and it doesn't matter what position you take if you're [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  Uh anti-abortion and pro-life. Well, you must be racist because you want to stop Planned Parenthood from killing black babies [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=222.7s)]
*  In an incredible at an incredible rate. So it was Joy Reid's job to paint [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=231.26s)]
*  everything that Republicans or conservatives or evangelicals do as racist and people have [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=237.4s)]
*  Happened to fall for that trap. She's lost some credibility [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=244.38s)]
*  Uh, I think on the other side of november 5th and they're going to replace her with people that will do the exact same job [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=247.9s)]
*  But they'll be less expensive. But yeah, I think Joy Reid is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=254.14s)]
*  One of the biggest race baiters in the history of American television [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=258.7s)]
*  But that's the really the only skill she had to offer and so she offered it up and what is [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=263.34s)]
*  Utterly ironic is that following her departure her ratings sucked by the way, they were terrible [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=269.18s)]
*  The following her departure Rachel Maddow the biggest star MSNBC then accused her own [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=275.26s)]
*  Boss's NBC of racism. Let's take a look [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=280.92s)]
*  I love everything about her. I have learned so much from her. I have so much more to learn from her [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=286.06s)]
*  I do not want to lose her as a colleague here at MSNBC [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=291.74s)]
*  And personally, I think it is a bad mistake to let her walk out the door [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=295.02s)]
*  It is not my call and I understand that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=299.26s)]
*  But that's what I think [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=302.14s)]
*  I will tell you it is also [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=303.74s)]
*  Unnerving to see that on a network where we've got two count them two non-white hosts in prime time [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=305.96s)]
*  Both of our non-white hosts in prime time are losing their shows as is Katie fang on the weekend [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=312.94s)]
*  And that feels worse than bad [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=320.22s)]
*  So martin monthill what's utterly bizarre about that? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=322.22s)]
*  rant from rachel maddow is that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=325.98s)]
*  Joy reed is being replaced on her show [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=329.42s)]
*  By not one person of color, but three [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=332.70000000000005s)]
*  Two african-americans and a latino [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=336.78000000000003s)]
*  Isn't that a good thing? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=340.70000000000005s)]
*  Isn't it the complete opposite of what she just told her viewers? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=343.42s)]
*  In rachel's monologue, which i'm not sure why you called it a rant but in her monologue [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  She said that it was a mistake to lose joy and prior to the part that you that you cut from [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=351.9s)]
*  She explained joy's talent. She explained why it was a loss. She never called the network racist [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=358.38s)]
*  I mean, I understand that that's your interpretation [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=363.41999999999996s)]
*  She said the two people of color in prime time were going but she didn't point out that one of them is being replaced by three people of color [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=365.41999999999996s)]
*  Right, so the whole statement the whole attack on her network was predicated on an absolute falsehood [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=372.7s)]
*  Which is that somehow they're taking the black people away and this is awful. It's racist was the clear [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=378.78s)]
*  insinuation [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=385.42s)]
*  Right and i was trying to make a nuanced point and if you allow me to finish the point uninterrupted as you allow jason [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=389.02s)]
*  So you'll hear it. I promise I won't go on a rant [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=393.98s)]
*  Okay [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=395.98s)]
*  What i'm saying is you can have a critique of someone making a mistake making a mistake [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=396.62s)]
*  Along the lines of race without them being racist for example saying hey, we need race racial representation on the show [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=399.82s)]
*  Is to say that hey, this is a network that has a huge black base a huge black woman base [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=406.78000000000003s)]
*  Hey, maybe it makes sense to have a popular black woman host stay on the show. That's her argument [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=411.1s)]
*  There's an argument against it for ratings. I'm not i'm not making a case right now one way or the other on that point [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=416.38s)]
*  My point more more precisely is it's not necessarily racist or you're not actually accusing someone of racism [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=420.7s)]
*  Racism to say that they made a mistake along the lines of race [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  That's all i'm saying and no black people are not interchangeable [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=430.46s)]
*  So even if I if I were to replace you piers with another british white male host [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=434.29999999999995s)]
*  Not everybody has your talent nobody not everybody has your your knack for deep listening and careful listening [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=439.82s)]
*  And so I can't say well, I got rid of piers, but here's another one [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=444.94s)]
*  So and I like the replacements, but I don't think that they're the same [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=447.41999999999996s)]
*  Uh, and then finally here, you know joy and read to just to kind of explain [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=450.7s)]
*  What jason said to say she doesn't have any other talent. I think it's just untrue. Uh, she has the fancy harvard degree [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=454.62s)]
*  She's an experienced journalist and she has deep insights that she offers her show isn't about being a race baiter [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=460.86s)]
*  This is the problem that I this is the problem that I see that's the biggest and that is that when someone responds to a race-based conversation [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=466.78000000000003s)]
*  You somehow they become the racist she's responding to the cutting of dei [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=473.98s)]
*  She's responding to people saying dei stands for didn't earn it. She's responding to people saying [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=478.3s)]
*  Dei stands for didn't earn it. She's responding to people cutting affirmative action. All of that is race talk and race-based policy [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=482.86s)]
*  She's critiquing the republicans, uh, the republican response to race policy and they're saying look she brought up race [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=488.86s)]
*  No, she's pointing out the problem with how they're dealing with race [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=494.54s)]
*  Okay, let me bring in sean speiser who's been smirking throughout your commentary there sean your thoughts on this [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=498.14s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's awful rich that rachel matta who works one day a week and makes 25 million dollars [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=505.98s)]
*  Has some huge concern for joy reed if you care about your friend that much and her well-being [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=511.1s)]
*  Offer one of the 25 million that you're getting to make to work one day a week to her second [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=516.22s)]
*  I mean with all due respect she's either if she were that popular the ratings would reflect it her show [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=521.02s)]
*  Was not being watched people were tuning it out and it was for a reason they didn't like the topics [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=527.26s)]
*  They didn't like her but it doesn't matter at the end of the day [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=531.98s)]
*  It's a business and the business is to attract advertisers that make the network money [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=535.1s)]
*  Clearly that was not the case if people really think you're that good at what you do [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=540.78s)]
*  Then they tune in the audience grows or it stays stagnant [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=545.8199999999999s)]
*  But in her case it was on a massive decline and that says that they didn't like her [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=549.18s)]
*  They didn't like her topics. They didn't like what she was talking about and it's pretty obvious [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=553.34s)]
*  There's only so many times you can you know play that schtick over and over again without people getting tired of it [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=557.98s)]
*  I think that the ratings reflected that [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=563.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean natalie winters. There's no doubt. I mean fox has been absolutely crushing everyone in cable news now [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=566.3800000000001s)]
*  They have three million viewers in prime time in the latest [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=573.1s)]
*  Numbers up 50 from the same month last year msnbc average 1.1 million down 16 [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=577.1s)]
*  cnn [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=584.3800000000001s)]
*  Half a million pretty much down three percent and enjoy reed's case apparently the ratings on tuesday without her jumped 16 [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=585.5s)]
*  Just by not having her sitting there [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=592.38s)]
*  Which doesn't entirely surprise me because whatever i'd had the misfortune to catch her. She was incredibly [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=594.4599999999999s)]
*  Incendiary in her race baiting. There's just no other way to describe it [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=600.3599999999999s)]
*  I mean mark's being very charitable in trying to defend her only ever responding to what you think were race issues [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=603.9799999999999s)]
*  And therefore if you criticize her you yourself are being racist [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=610.54s)]
*  But come on she'd look for every opportunity she could possibly find to accuse everybody who wasn't [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=613.42s)]
*  Can I ask you a question of racism [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=620.3s)]
*  Pierce can you name one time one topic that she where she invoked freefall and and I would just add [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=624.22s)]
*  Even though msnbc. I think they are overdosing on critical race theory [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=629.42s)]
*  They find racism in every single corner in every single story [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=633.5s)]
*  And frankly if joy reed were white and the tables were flipped and she was saying these things about people of color [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=637.26s)]
*  I'm sure she would last about all of one show [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=642.46s)]
*  Um on cable news, but I think frankly this discussion [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=645.02s)]
*  I think it sort of misses the mark [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=648.54s)]
*  I think the reason why a lot of the msnbc viewership has been absolutely cratering in part people don't buy into the ad hominem attacks [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=649.82s)]
*  Just look at the election results [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=656.62s)]
*  But this is a network that has lied to their audience day after day show after show [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=658.22s)]
*  Not only about how president trump is a threat to democracy how he's an autocrat and authoritarian [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=663.66s)]
*  And we're witnessing a takeover a hostile takeover of this country [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=668.62s)]
*  But they're sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place because in the same breath right where they preach [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=672.38s)]
*  The idea of democratically elected representatives and they're the staunch defenders of democracy [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=677.74s)]
*  They're now actively opposing and try to use sort of outside of the system tactics to oppose and essentially take down [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=682.38s)]
*  A democratically elected president so they're sort of grassroots really hardcore base viewership [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=688.62s)]
*  They feel lied to that's why they're abandoning and your average american viewer [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=694.62s)]
*  Doesn't want to partake in the sort of color revolution tactics and propaganda that they're pushing to smear president trump with [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=698.62s)]
*  Yeah, and also I think you know when meek and and joe went down to [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=705.0999999999999s)]
*  See trump at morillago. I think that was seen by a lot of msnbc [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=709.5s)]
*  Viewers as a real betrayal, you know for whatever good intentions. They did it [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=713.8199999999999s)]
*  I just think if you call someone a fascist for year after year after year and then you go and have tea with them [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=718.2199999999999s)]
*  It's not it's not an easy thing to explain to your viewers. Um, and a [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=723.74s)]
*  I mean i'm gonna play you a clip. This is [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=728.06s)]
*  where megan kelly [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=730.46s)]
*  Says her commentary about this and then don lehman [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=732.46s)]
*  responded [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=735.72s)]
*  the big news [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=737.34s)]
*  tonight [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=738.78s)]
*  Will be joy reed's final show on msnbc [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=739.9s)]
*  Single-tier white woman tears happening right here joy [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=744.46s)]
*  She was officially fired over the weekend because she's a racist [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=748.7s)]
*  Horrible news anchor with no ratings the worst person on television was fired from [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=753.26s)]
*  NBC in the today show [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=759.8s)]
*  A few years ago and that's megan kelly [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=762.38s)]
*  So let me just say to megan kelly in my 30 some years as a journalist and my 50 some years as a person of color [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=764.54s)]
*  Go fuck yourself [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=771.5s)]
*  Okay [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=773.42s)]
*  I do love the way that don positions himself as the antidote to toxicity [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=774.86s)]
*  Uh, and then tells people to go fuck themselves [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=779.42s)]
*  Um, but anna look it's it's it's all blowing up this I do think it's it's interesting [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=782.32s)]
*  The msnbc having gone all in on carmela harris [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=787.12s)]
*  Uh and all out on trump because of the election result now seem to be in some kind of crisis of confidence about what they should be [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=792.08s)]
*  Uh, what do you think of it? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=799.7600000000001s)]
*  Well, I actually think that you know the obsession over the [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=803.12s)]
*  Conversation on race and race baiting kind of misses the mark on what I think msnbc [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=807.44s)]
*  Is really vulnerable on and that's the issue of trust and credibility among audience members or [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=813.2s)]
*  Anyone who might be considering msnbc as a news horror news source. So for instance [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=821.52s)]
*  Kamala harris did not run a flawless campaign [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=827.2s)]
*  not [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=830.5600000000001s)]
*  By a long shot. Okay. Her campaign was very flawed [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=831.52s)]
*  It did not have a focused message [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=835.6800000000001s)]
*  She was taking advice from you know, corporate executives within her family and she moved off of the economic issues that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=838.24s)]
*  obviously voters [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=845.5s)]
*  Consistently communicated through polling they cared the most about and so when she goes on camera and says that kamala harris ran a flawless campaign [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=847.1800000000001s)]
*  After the election in which donald trump wins all the swing states in the popular vote. I think [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=856.32s)]
*  Audiences start to become more cynical about where they're getting their information [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=862.3000000000001s)]
*  And so a lot of lies were kind of debunked [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=867.44s)]
*  In the aftermath of the election and when I say lies i'm specifically referring to how fantastic the democratic party is [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=871.52s)]
*  How they really have a vision for the future how flawless kamala harris is, you know [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=878.64s)]
*  Even though the aggregate of polls showed that she was trailing donald trump [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=883.12s)]
*  We kept hearing all of these rosy news reports about how she was doing fantastic [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=887.7600000000001s)]
*  And so I think the democratic party and the left in general really needs to have a moment of self-reflection [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=892.8000000000001s)]
*  Instead of seeking out news content that validates everything that they believe and want to hear [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=901.5200000000001s)]
*  And that's honestly the biggest flaw and down, you know downside of the democratic party at the moment and people like joy reed unfortunately [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=907.5200000000001s)]
*  You know foster that kind of environment that made them think no, no, we're killing it. We're doing great [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=915.1999999999999s)]
*  Now, I don't think that msnbc has learned the right lessons because they they're basically replacing joy reed's hour with other individuals [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=920.16s)]
*  Who are you know never trump democrats? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=928.64s)]
*  Although michael steel used to be the head of the republican national committee, but nonetheless he hates trump [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=931.1999999999999s)]
*  And so they're going to keep focusing on uplifting democrats that I think [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=936.7199999999999s)]
*  Really need to get back in touch with the american people and understand what their genuine concerns are [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=941.28s)]
*  They're not doing that right now [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=947.04s)]
*  I think they're looking for other mouthpieces that are willing to just tell them what they want to hear [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=948.48s)]
*  Well, you're shaking your head. Why they're also hiring eugene daniels who was a kamala fanboy from politico [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=952.56s)]
*  To go over there and do this so they're doubling down on stupid. They just I mean, I think it was said earlier [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=960.24s)]
*  They're just getting cheaper versions, right? So joy reed probably signed her contract [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=964.4s)]
*  When msnbc was a cent it's now flailing and falling apart financially and otherwise [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=968.48s)]
*  So they're going in and getting cheaper versions of stupid. Yeah, and you know, it's interesting to watch cnn where scott jennings [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=973.44s)]
*  Appears as the republican voice and basically takes on sometimes three four liberals at the same time [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=980.0s)]
*  And often often eats some more for breakfast [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=986.8000000000001s)]
*  Um, but but it's very entertaining to watch and mark, you know, you're shaking your head [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=989.36s)]
*  But the problem either the msnbc it's all completely one-way traffic [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=993.36s)]
*  They're just not interested in having anybody on there who differs from the view that trumps the devil and that's the end of it [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=998.1600000000001s)]
*  Um, whereas I think what's happening at cnn with scott jennings is quite interesting. It's more it's more interesting to watch [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1004.48s)]
*  You know, I like on this show for example as we're seeing right now to have people with all different voices [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1009.5200000000001s)]
*  Uh, the idea you only have one type of voice [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1015.36s)]
*  Particularly when you've just taken a massive beating with that voice in the election. It seems to me just bad business, isn't it? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1018.4000000000001s)]
*  Um, no, uh to answer your question the reason I was shaking my head the reason I was shaking my head was [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1026.0s)]
*  Uh, because it's it's simply not accurate what what the person before me said, uh this idea that [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1033.28s)]
*  Uh joy ann reid was saying that you know, the democratic party is perfect and that they made no mistakes [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1039.12s)]
*  Uh, and that all the campaigns were flawless that that's simply not factual [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1044.6399999999999s)]
*  Uh now I happen to believe that the democratic party made tons of mistakes [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1049.12s)]
*  And I think that Kamala Harris's campaign was flawless [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1052.64s)]
*  Right, so just again [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1058.0s)]
*  Hear me out and then and then you can disagree and we can agree who knows maybe if you hear me you may find out [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1060.0800000000002s)]
*  You agree with me? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1064.64s)]
*  um [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1065.76s)]
*  Kamala Harris is one of the few people who was critical of the biden administration's [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1067.2800000000002s)]
*  Position on gaza. She was one of the few people along with aimin mohaddeen and mehdi hessen last year before he was fired [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1072.16s)]
*  Who spoke out against what the biden slash harris administration did she also spoke out against kamala's response to it [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1078.24s)]
*  I agree with you that they were too laudatory of the kamala harris campaign and I agree with you that in general [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1083.92s)]
*  Uh, they haven't done a sufficient autopsy of the democratic party much less the harris campaign [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1089.8400000000001s)]
*  Which I think could not have won anyway [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1094.88s)]
*  I don't think she was a strong candidate and I don't think she had a strong message to the american people [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1096.64s)]
*  I suspect we agree on that where I disagree with you is is that kamala harris was not unwilling to be critical [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1100.4s)]
*  Excuse me. Joyanne reed was not unwilling to be critical of the party [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1106.32s)]
*  I think the problem is that msnbc in general [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1110.32s)]
*  Is a left-wing slash liberal really organ or political? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1113.12s)]
*  Organ peers. No, I don't think that that is inherently problematic [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1117.52s)]
*  Donald trump lost big the last election and fox news didn't hire me, you know [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1121.04s)]
*  But fox news have people like jessica talof on the five and stuff that they will regularly [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1127.6799999999998s)]
*  They will regularly have people on the left to give the other side and actually it's just more interesting I [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1132.24s)]
*  I just I and that's fine. You're entitled to find fox news more interesting. I happen to not find msnbc interesting at all [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1138.4s)]
*  So i'm not caping for msnbc here. What i'm saying is that is that news is that is that news outlets in general? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1144.0s)]
*  Have a point of view even ones that pretend that they don't and I don't want to single msnbc out as if they're the outlier [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1150.3200000000002s)]
*  Ideological channel and the other ones are straight news every nobody is straight news anymore. You look at news [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1156.7s)]
*  But I think that's true. But I think msnbc. Yeah, but they're the only ones [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1160.88s)]
*  Honestly, they're the only ones who pretty much never have a conservative in other words an opposite voice [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1164.88s)]
*  Oh, they're business model sucks. I mean they're failing. That's the point. Yeah fox you can't create [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1170.0s)]
*  I mean if you don't like fox, but at the end of the day, it's growing [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1174.48s)]
*  So they're doing something right as a business msnbc [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1177.68s)]
*  Even if you ideologically I agree with mark on that but but if it worked for them, yes, then go for it make money [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1180.96s)]
*  It's not and that's the point at some point the executives have to say hey [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1187.76s)]
*  You're not doing your job, which is we're supposed to make money as a company as a business [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1192.08s)]
*  So do something clearly not wait. Listen, it's really not working [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1196.6399999999999s)]
*  There wouldn't be far with all due respect showing with all due respect showing you argue with all due respect showing you that's a strong man [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1199.36s)]
*  That's a strong man. Sean. I'm not disputing that companies make money. I'm not disputing the msnbc is doing a sucky job [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1205.04s)]
*  I'm not disputing the msnbc's ratings are bad and that they have to make a different a different decision when the ratings are bad [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1211.6s)]
*  I agree with all of those things despite despite your your arguments here [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1216.8s)]
*  I'm saying that one joy and reed is not singular in that way everybody in msnbc [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1220.4s)]
*  This side of rachel maddow sucks. So when you when you fire somebody at rachel maddow for sucking [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1225.2s)]
*  When you fire somebody msnbc for sucking it's it's somewhat of an arbitrary choice. I'm saying who are we choosing and why? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1230.4s)]
*  And when we were just financial decision, what do what do we what do we replace them? Okay? Listen, I want to move [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1235.6000000000001s)]
*  I want to move on. I want to move on [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1240.56s)]
*  The only thing I would dispute martha you said is [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1243.3600000000001s)]
*  When you claim that rachel wasn't playing the race card with when she attacked the network [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1245.68s)]
*  She clearly was and was trying to make out that somehow I didn't say that I said I said she didn't call the racist [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1249.8400000000001s)]
*  Hang on. I said she didn't call the racist. I said she didn't call the race. I'm not going to let you misrepresent [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1255.2800000000002s)]
*  I said she didn't call the neighborhood. Why else would she invoke? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1260.3200000000002s)]
*  Why else would she invoke joy reed's skin color if she having been removed? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1263.68s)]
*  Effectively because she was black she was saying when she's been replaced by three people of color. It was preposterous [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1268.3999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, look, let's move on. Let's move on. Let's move on. Let's move on [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1273.9199999999998s)]
*  Misrepresent my position. That's fine. We've done 20 minutes on this [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1277.76s)]
*  It's more than I want to spend on msnbc because they're getting the biggest audience right now they've ever had so let's move on [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1280.24s)]
*  Um to the press pool purge, so let's take a a start here of the announcement [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1285.1999999999998s)]
*  As you all know for decades a group of dc-based journalists the white house correspondence association [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1291.12s)]
*  Has long dictated which journalists get to ask questions of the president of the united states in these most intimate spaces [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1297.38s)]
*  not anymore [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1305.14s)]
*  I am proud to announce that we are going to give the power back to the people who read your papers [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1307.14s)]
*  Who watch your television shows and who listen to your radio stations? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1312.26s)]
*  Moving forward the white house press pool will be determined by the white house press team [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1316.5800000000002s)]
*  Legacy outlets who have participated in the press pool for decades will still be allowed to join fear not [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1321.7s)]
*  But we will also be offering the privilege to well deserving outlets who have never been allowed to share in this awesome [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1328.5s)]
*  responsibility [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1336.0s)]
*  Sean spicer [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1337.38s)]
*  What's your honest reaction to this because I could say is I think it's finn you do fantastic [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1338.74s)]
*  Oh, absolutely, but just so audience understands. There's two things to know number one the white house correspondence association [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1344.66s)]
*  Determines has a set of criteria who can join it and if you can't join it they limit that by [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1351.28s)]
*  What you do for a living whether your financial interests your transparency with your company [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1356.58s)]
*  There's a set of criteria you can go on their website and read it [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1360.42s)]
*  So for example, I tried to join when I went to newsmax. They rejected my application [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1362.82s)]
*  So they get to determine who's in it [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1367.7s)]
*  And then what happens is there's a list with what caroli's referring to there is the pool [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1369.6200000000001s)]
*  So there's in smaller instances not in the briefing room, obviously the oval office air force one [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1374.26s)]
*  There is a pool. What is that one or two print wire reporters cameras photographers and they among themselves [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1380.02s)]
*  The white house correspondence association will rotate nbc abc news fox whatever and so every day they take a different turn [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1386.9s)]
*  Then they disseminate that information to the rest of the the media outlets. So the white house correspondence [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1393.78s)]
*  Restricts who can be part of that thereby limiting who can be part who can go to the oval office or air force one [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1401.12s)]
*  What caroline announced there was they get to stay part of it, right? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1407.54s)]
*  So you're still going to have nbc and abc, but it's going to be augmented. They're going to allow a new media seat [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1411.54s)]
*  They're going to add additional cameraman. This is actually more [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1416.98s)]
*  Transparency more media access more appreciation for the white house [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1421.44s)]
*  Correspondence under the biden administration. They cut [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1426.64s)]
*  440 press passes from independent journalism and the white house correspondence association said nothing [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1430.32s)]
*  These people don't care about press access. They don't care about the first amendment [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1437.14s)]
*  They care about controlling what the american people see read and hear by limiting who has access and they're pissed [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1441.54s)]
*  That somebody now actually outside of them can go into the oval office or on air force one and actually disseminate information [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1448.1s)]
*  I don't mind that bit. Yeah, listen [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1454.5s)]
*  I don't actually have any objection to that for the reasons you've articulated very well [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1456.58s)]
*  But the the problem I do have is with the associated press getting barred from entering the oval office or traveling on air force one [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1460.34s)]
*  Because they refuse to use the new terminology gulf of america for the gulf of mexico as it was known before donald trump [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1466.74s)]
*  Renamed it and their position is they're an international [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1473.78s)]
*  Organization which they clearly indisputably are and that many places outside of america continue to call it gulf of mexico [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1477.6s)]
*  As it's been known historically why should they be barred for that? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1485.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's actually much broader. It has to do with their whole style book how they use they mandate what people [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1490.02s)]
*  What other news organizations use so they would start saying we're going to capitalize the word black, but not white [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1496.5s)]
*  We're going to use gender affirming care. We're going to use pronouns [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1501.94s)]
*  They actually dictate everything that a lot of media associations and frankly even u.s. Government outlets use [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1504.98s)]
*  Based on the style book. So here's the thing that people have to remember the associated press still has their press passes [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1512.18s)]
*  They're still in the white house briefing room, but the invitation to go into the president's office they've restricted [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1517.86s)]
*  That's not freedom of freedom of the press is allowing them to write what they want [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1524.34s)]
*  To say what they want and they still enjoy all of that [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1528.58s)]
*  They enjoy full access to the white house briefing room all their correspondents have their past the president has a right [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1531.3799999999999s)]
*  To decide who goes into his office [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1537.6999999999998s)]
*  I can't walk into the associated press's office just because I have a first amendment right to say things [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1539.6999999999998s)]
*  This is ridiculous. They get to decide who goes into his office. Okay, that's his prerogative [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1545.54s)]
*  Okay, mark it's ridiculous apparently but you're not having it [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1551.06s)]
*  The president's office isn't like walking into my office or sean's office that that's that's that's sort of a dishonest comparison [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1556.82s)]
*  At the end of the day, we want to make sure that the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1563.14s)]
*  Sure sure that the the white house trump's office and more broadly the white house is not just a a space [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1566.98s)]
*  It's a signpost of access to to to democracy access to the political process [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1573.78s)]
*  And and that's what we're concerned about [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1579.7s)]
*  I agree with you that press freedom is about being able to write what you want without pressure without any type of punishment [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1581.06s)]
*  I think the issue here is if different people have different access levels of access based on their style guide based on what their [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1587.62s)]
*  Political persuasion is it encourages or incentivizes people to make certain choices versus others at the end of the day here [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1594.5s)]
*  I'm not even concerned about trump. I'll be honest with you [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1600.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean I am concerned about trump, but that's not my biggest concern [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1603.06s)]
*  My concern here is I don't want particular political administrations whether they're democrat or republican [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1605.3s)]
*  Making decisions about who comprises the press corps who gets into certain rooms and who doesn't because even if you trust trump completely [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1611.14s)]
*  Or even if you trust the next president completely there will be political organizations and political administrations who we cannot trust [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1617.3s)]
*  Okay, and when that happens, I don't want them to be the decider. All right, let me bring in. Let me bring in jason [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1623.54s)]
*  If you agree with everything that mark said which is I think very fair points then where was this concern? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1629.6200000000001s)]
*  When the last administration cut 440 passes of journalists, where was the concern when the white house correspondents restricted anyone else? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1635.0600000000002s)]
*  From joining the point. It's a good point. I love this, but these are not then where was all of those things? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1642.8200000000002s)]
*  I think there is a double standard. I agree with you and actually, you know the biggest I don't think it's a double standard [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1647.5400000000002s)]
*  But we should have been concerned. All right, the biggest attacker on a journalist and journalism and journalistic rights actually was barack obama [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1652.74s)]
*  Historically heeded more to erode the rights of journalists than anyone [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1660.16s)]
*  Never mind trump. Um, let me bring in anna here. I mean, it's you know, it's a tricky area this what what was clear [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1664.74s)]
*  Um is this extraordinary stack onto the national journal president trump has taken over a thousand questions from reporters [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1671.3000000000002s)]
*  In his first month of the second term compared to biden 141 and obama 161 [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1677.8600000000001s)]
*  So this idea that he's not the most transparent [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1684.98s)]
*  President in modern times is for the birds. He clearly is people may not like what he's saying [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1687.8600000000001s)]
*  But the he's taking questions from pretty much anyone all the time [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1692.9s)]
*  Well, i'm about to say things that will upset everyone on each side of the political aisle because honestly [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1699.38s)]
*  I think that there are bad actors on both sides. So for instance [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1705.62s)]
*  There was a lack of transparency under the biden administration and that lack of transparency had to do with the fact that he was suffering [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1709.14s)]
*  For mental decline and everyone around him was hiding him from the public [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1715.46s)]
*  So he didn't have nearly enough press briefings [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1719.14s)]
*  Uh, they were kind of evasive with important questions and that cover-up ultimately [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1722.98s)]
*  Destroyed the democratic party certainly in the last election cycle now in regard to donald trump [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1728.74s)]
*  I agree that it is a good thing to include members of independent media new media [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1733.86s)]
*  I think that's generally speaking a great thing. I would be far more celebratory if donald trump wasn't so [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1739.38s)]
*  Devastatingly petty and also retaliatory against media that doesn't you know serve his interests or do exactly what he wants? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1746.08s)]
*  So, you know the ap is a good example. I think another example is this lawsuit against 60 minutes [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1754.4199999999998s)]
*  Obviously when you're airing an interview on television you have time constraints. You have to cut down [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1760.6399999999999s)]
*  On some of the content or the interview answers so it fits in so you can go to break and I hate that model [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1766.58s)]
*  I think live linear has a lot of downfalls and that's one of them [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1772.6599999999999s)]
*  But the idea that they intentionally edited her to make kamala harris sound [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1776.26s)]
*  Better is laughable to me because whether it's the world word salad answer on what's happening in israel and gaza or the shortened answer [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1781.3s)]
*  I don't think she really particularly had a great answer. It didn't make her look good and trump won the election [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1788.82s)]
*  What are you doing suing 60 minutes over this? That's insanity. Well, I think you look I think you've been faced [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1794.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think if you face this he did if you face two years of relentless bullshit about russia collusion [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1799.7s)]
*  Um, you've probably got a very very cynical view of the way the very liberal skewed mainstream media has behaved towards you and [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1804.98s)]
*  Trump, you know, he's got a I would say he has the thinnest skin i've ever met and the thickest [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1812.58s)]
*  He can take stuff that would destroy anybody else but he's going to react to absolutely every slight that anyone imposes on him [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1817.06s)]
*  It's just his nature. He ain't going to change it 78. I can tell you I understand what you're saying pierced [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1822.74s)]
*  I understand what you're saying, but understand that you know, do we value our constitution or not? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1828.1799999999998s)]
*  Do we value freedom of the press or not? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1833.06s)]
*  Do we value the idea that the government cannot retaliate against you over your speech in america? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1835.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I value those things and it's really important for the president through his actions to prove that he also values [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1840.4199999999998s)]
*  Okay, jason, um, you've been waiting patiently. What's your view of this? He's proven he's proven a million times [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1847.06s)]
*  That he values the freedom of the press the man went to the nabj convention [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1853.38s)]
*  sat down in front of uh, uh two black women and probably a gay black man, I can't remember [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1859.0600000000002s)]
*  Went into the den the people that hate him the most and took all their questions [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1864.66s)]
*  They were late getting on stage late showing up. He took all their questions [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1869.46s)]
*  The man is fearless and he has every right to punch back the associated press is associated [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1873.5400000000002s)]
*  Propaganda it is the enemy of america. Donald trump's not lying there. The associated press is part of this [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1880.5800000000002s)]
*  Global establishment that wants to destroy [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1888.66s)]
*  American freedoms and this man has every right to punch back. They need to be hitting the mouth. They lie [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1891.7s)]
*  Every day they distort every day. They're part of again. I've heard you all say hey, this isn't about race [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1897.96s)]
*  Yes, it is the associated press and all the american media have been pulling a racial hoax [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1903.88s)]
*  On voters and the american citizens for 60 straight years [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1909.64s)]
*  If you don't support these left-wing propaganda deals all of it hook line and sinker [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1914.2s)]
*  You're a racist and there's no greater smear. Nothing can hurt your uh economic viability [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1919.72s)]
*  Opportunities in the media opportunities just to be seen as a normal citizen than these leftists calling you [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1926.42s)]
*  a racist for supporting the constitution and just common sense, okay, we [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1933.16s)]
*  I'm gonna say i'm gonna say i don't beat up the associated propaganda [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1939.4s)]
*  I just I just listen. I don't think the world. I don't think the associated press is the biggest threat american faces right now [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1943.88s)]
*  I've done brutal having run a national newspaper in the UK for 10 years [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1949.5600000000002s)]
*  The ap it has its issues like all these uh, uh [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1954.68s)]
*  Agencies, but actually they do a pretty good pretty impartial job most of the time. I think it's been wildly [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1959.3200000000002s)]
*  Exaggerated that they're some kind of media version of isis. Um, but let me bring in uh, uh natalie here because I just want to [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1964.98s)]
*  I want to talk to natalie about the the um, other thing that's come out, which is jeff bazos of the washington post [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1973.24s)]
*  Who emailed all employees to say that we're going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars personal liberties [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1979.64s)]
*  And free markets will cover other topics too, of course [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1987.24s)]
*  But viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left by to be published by others [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1990.28s)]
*  They said i'm of america and for america and proud to be so our country didn't get here by being typical [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=1996.12s)]
*  And a big part of america's success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else freedom is ethical [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2001.3999999999999s)]
*  It minimizes coercion and practical it drives creativity invention and prosperity now [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2006.76s)]
*  um critics have said this is another example of a tech [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2012.1999999999998s)]
*  Brolygarc and a bending the knee to trump smothering press freedom and so on [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2015.4s)]
*  I just wonder why he would want to do this if you're owning a national newspaper in america [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2019.96s)]
*  Why would you publicly announce that you're going to? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2026.92s)]
*  actively not have [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2030.6000000000001s)]
*  Views contrary to the view that you hold [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2032.8400000000001s)]
*  Well piers as a newly minted member of this whole new media initiative that the white house is rolling out [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2038.28s)]
*  I would like to just real quickly say one thing and that is that this whole narrative that it's the white house [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2042.92s)]
*  Correspondence association that is the victim in all of this [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2048.34s)]
*  It's the american people and what you're hearing is continued victim blaming coming out of these legacy media outlets [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2051.2400000000002s)]
*  Who not just for the last four years of joe biden totally did not cover anything to do with his magnet mental cognitive [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2057.0s)]
*  Capacities and capabilities being absolutely zero [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2063.2200000000003s)]
*  But they colluded with the biden white house with big tech to censor americans who dared to speak out about covet about [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2066.04s)]
*  Vaccines about election fraud about every single issue [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2072.5s)]
*  So spare me the performative activism that these people care about free speech or freedom of the press and frankly [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2075.48s)]
*  I find it quite ironic if not hypocritical that mark lamont hill who I believe is on the payroll of al jazeera [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2081.0s)]
*  So the qatari government wants to sit there and say that free speech and freedom of the press is so important [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2087.32s)]
*  I'd suggest that you look up that country's rules when it comes to freedom of expression freedom of speech freedom of religion [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2092.92s)]
*  It's not that great i'd invite you to criticize cutter on air, but you probably won't because you lose your paycheck [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2099.16s)]
*  Give me an example of that give me an example of that you just said [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2106.6s)]
*  What is your issue with cut your stance on free speech since you're since you're criticizing the qatari government's position on free press [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2110.04s)]
*  What is the cut? What is it? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2115.8s)]
*  I dare you to criticize the migrant workers that they used to build the studio this stadium. No, no, we're talking about free speech [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2118.68s)]
*  No, no, we're we're we're [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2125.08s)]
*  On you hang on no, no, no [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2128.04s)]
*  I have publicly not only have I publicly criticized the guest worker program of of cutter [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2134.04s)]
*  And I specifically interviewed a kenyan worker who had been exploited by the qatari government and I have publicly been critical of the qatari government [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2138.52s)]
*  So let's not say I dare you do that. I've done that but the question here was about press freedom [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2144.92s)]
*  You said that there's a specific issue you have with qatari press freedom that I somehow won't speak out [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2148.68s)]
*  What is your issue with country first press press freedom, I suspect you don't actually understand cutery press freedom [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2153.3999999999996s)]
*  But you're making a talking point that you can't unpack. So please instead of pivoting to migrant workers, please tell me [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2158.04s)]
*  Please tell me what is your issue when it comes to press freedom in the entire world [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2164.2799999999997s)]
*  I can tell you [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2168.7599999999998s)]
*  Natalie just for what it's worth. I actually criticized high level qatari officials [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2173.7999999999997s)]
*  On this show in qatar during the world cup about the migrant worker issue at the world cup [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2179.7999999999997s)]
*  And nobody in qatar had any problem with it. So this idea that they suppress that kind of criticism [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2187.0s)]
*  They don't even suppress it when you're there doing it on air from qatar [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2193.56s)]
*  So I think that is a misunderstanding. I'm not exactly sure that you guys want to be dying on the hill of qatari press freedom [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2197.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm pretty sure what was it the latest? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2204.2799999999997s)]
*  And I think about 130 out of 170 countries when it comes to press freedom [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2206.28s)]
*  They don't think you can look at one. I mean, it's an autocratic regime. All right, let me ask [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2210.6800000000003s)]
*  Let me ask you. I want to move on to this which is uh, I want to move on to the washington post [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2215.0800000000004s)]
*  Um, short spicer washington post. Yeah, I i'm uncomfortable about this. I'll be honest with you [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2219.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't think jeff baisall should have done this. I think it's one thing to have [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2224.6800000000003s)]
*  Subliminal influence or your editor to do it quietly and you you know you do it fine [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2229.46s)]
*  But to actually publicly announce the washington post one of the great papers in america is no longer going to run contrary views [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2233.8799999999997s)]
*  on its opinion pages against the views or [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2241.64s)]
*  Positions that the owner's taken. I think that's a very slippery road. What do you think? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2245.62s)]
*  Well, this goes back to the conversation we're having with msnbc where it's a business decision [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2251.96s)]
*  The washington post is is flailing basically if it wasn't [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2256.2s)]
*  For a billionaire like jeff baisall's propping them up they would go out of business [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2259.88s)]
*  What I think he's trying to do is recognize that that you know, this is kind of the old michael jordan philosophy on sneakers republicans by sneakers democrats by sneakers [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2264.12s)]
*  They've realized that the post has moved so far to the left that they've lost people [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2272.76s)]
*  They've gaslit readers and view and people who used to think that the washington post [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2276.92s)]
*  Was actually fact-based so he's taking the opinion page [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2282.28s)]
*  Which has always been something that owners have had a hand in and saying hey i'm going to just make it straight now [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2285.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm just going to talk about free markets [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2291.48s)]
*  Principles that are important to us [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2294.04s)]
*  But i'm not going to get into the gaslighting of the of the right that I have seen this page do [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2295.7999999999997s)]
*  This is a smart business move. The paper is unsustainable right now and that's why they're doing it [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2301.0s)]
*  But he needs to get people back into the into the fold because the washington post has drifted so far [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2307.72s)]
*  To the left I get that but why but why is it why is it supporting free speech to ban [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2313.3199999999997s)]
*  A certain amount of speech. I mean mark lamont hill. It's not but but I mean but but piers here's the point [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2319.24s)]
*  I don't think first of all, it was banned in the past you could call what you want [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2323.9599999999996s)]
*  But at the end of the day think about what happened to the new york times, right? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2326.9199999999996s)]
*  We're we're no no, I get it. I get it. I get why they're doing it [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2330.2799999999997s)]
*  I just don't they did they used to they just banned the right and didn't tell us now what they're saying is we're just gonna [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2333.24s)]
*  I get that but they didn't make an announcement about it and I think mark lamont hill [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2338.04s)]
*  It just sits for decades as a journalist it just sits uncomfortably with me that an opinion page [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2341.88s)]
*  Where you would imagine there would be a lot of disparate opinions encouraged and to have open free debate [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2347.0800000000004s)]
*  But but no one again this gets back to what I said earlier about the correspondence association for decades right leaning voices were shut [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2352.6000000000004s)]
*  Now I understand that okay, just shut out and so now that he wants to be straight everybody goes [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2359.1600000000003s)]
*  I get it, but he's not been appointed. The point is shawne. He's not being straight. He's going he's going the other way [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2363.4s)]
*  Shawn [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2367.8s)]
*  I was with you until I was with shawne until the very last second [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2369.4s)]
*  So I was literally about to give you a hug virtually and we were about to agree totally [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2372.92s)]
*  They're not going straight when you say [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2376.84s)]
*  Yeah, when you say we're not we're only going to basically support free market fundamentalism libertarianism, and that's the only position we're offering [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2379.08s)]
*  That's not doing it straight. That's going from hard left to hard right and look I I agree with you [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2386.12s)]
*  It is a business decision. They have a right to make that business decision [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2391.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't think it's good for the american democracy [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2394.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't think it's good for the american media landscape just like I wish the new york times had more right-leaning voices [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2397.24s)]
*  I think we need diversity everywhere. Just like I wish msnbc had more diverse voice [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2402.2s)]
*  I wish everybody I wish fox news had more diverse voice [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2406.2s)]
*  I wish everybody actually had real conversations with people who disagreed with them and not just on issues of race [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2408.52s)]
*  Not just get the woman to talk about gender and a guy the black black guy to talk about, you know race [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2413.96s)]
*  But to have real substantive diverse conversations around a range of issues. I'd love that. Okay. I think this is not [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2418.2799999999997s)]
*  That's right. This is finally I don't think it's going to work [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2423.88s)]
*  The outreach only comes for decades on end [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2426.92s)]
*  No one was concerned about the left-leaning editorial page of the washington post the second that bezo says and maybe maybe he goes hard [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2429.64s)]
*  Right, but why is it suddenly a problem? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2436.52s)]
*  We've barely we've been shut out of the discussion for so long on the right that the second that someone comes along and says hey [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2438.76s)]
*  This is a bad business model. I don't think jeff bezos actually believes this crap [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2443.96s)]
*  Same the way I don't believe zuckerberg believes any of this they're just making smart business decisions [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2448.12s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I don't I mean i'm with you mark [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2452.52s)]
*  I wish that you could have gotten an op-ed from someone on the right and someone on the left and actually been informed [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2455.96s)]
*  But the washington post the new york times have shut out voices on the right for decades [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2460.52s)]
*  And now everybody's up in arms because wow, maybe [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2465.56s)]
*  All right guys, i'm moving on to other topics jake tapper has a new book. Thank you pierce [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2472.84s)]
*  Jake jake tapper has a new book out yet [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2478.6s)]
*  Uh, not yet. What's that? It's not yet. I I will predict here. I don't think this book [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2480.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm glad you're covering this but I will bet you today. It doesn't get published. Okay [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2485.48s)]
*  Well, let's explain what it is to viewers. You don't know it's called original sin president biden's decline [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2489.3199999999997s)]
*  It's cover up and it's disastrous choice to run again [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2493.96s)]
*  um [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2497.24s)]
*  Now what the reason is blown up and being so kind of uh tricky is that jake gave an interview or was interviewing [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2498.68s)]
*  laura trump, uh when she [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2506.7599999999998s)]
*  And well, let's play the clip you mark it out for yourselves what happens [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2509.0s)]
*  I think what we see on stage with joe biden jake is very clearly a cognitive decline [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2512.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what i'm referring to it makes me uncomfortable. You have you are no [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2518.44s)]
*  I can't this is so amazing [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2523.0800000000004s)]
*  It's so amazing to me that and try and figure out an answer a cognitive decline [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2524.44s)]
*  You're trying to tell me that what I was suggesting was I think that you were mocking his stutter [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2528.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think you were mocking his stutter [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2533.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think you have absolutely no standing to diagnose somebody's cognitive decline [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2535.16s)]
*  I would think that somebody in the trump family would be more sensitive to people who do do not have medical licenses [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2539.48s)]
*  diagnosing politicians from afar [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2547.22s)]
*  The criticism anna here is that in the blurb for the book? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2551.48s)]
*  Uh, it goes on to say what you will learn makes president biden's decision to run for reelection seem shockingly narcissistic self-delusional [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2554.92s)]
*  And reckless a desperate bet that went bust and part of a larger act of extended public deception that has few precedents [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2561.5s)]
*  And people are saying well, hang on that decision was taken literally around the time [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2568.62s)]
*  That that interview took place with lara trump when you were enraged jake now. I like jake and he's a very good broadcaster [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2573.66s)]
*  But he's going to face a lot of criticism. I think about this apparent [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2580.14s)]
*  Double standard here. What do you think anna? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2584.28s)]
*  I [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2587.18s)]
*  Mean, I agree and he should face some backlash for the fact that he skewered anyone who was concerned about [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2588.62s)]
*  biden's age during the 2020 election cycle and after the election cycle, but you know, he [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2597.3399999999997s)]
*  Couldn't really pretend as though biden still had perfect mental health after that disastrous debate for the 2024 [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2603.8999999999996s)]
*  Election cycle I would have maybe sat this one out. Maybe don't publish that book [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2612.06s)]
*  Maybe find a different topic and look I want to make a broader point a broader point about [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2616.3s)]
*  You know democrats in general and I don't I say this out of kindness because I think this is what's leading to them making [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2622.46s)]
*  poor decisions [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2630.2200000000003s)]
*  If the right claims something I get the temptation to automatically assume it's it's bad faith [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2632.3s)]
*  There's no truth to it. No credibility. No merit [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2639.26s)]
*  I get that temptation to think that and you know what in a lot of cases that might even be true [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2642.06s)]
*  But sometimes they make good points and you should as someone who purports to be a journalist just investigate it [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2647.42s)]
*  You don't have to believe what anyone says at face value [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2655.02s)]
*  But just investigate it a little bit because they might be telling the truth [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2658.14s)]
*  They might be you know lifting the veil on some big issue that the left is blind to so [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2662.86s)]
*  Please don't automatically assume that if someone on the right says something it's automatically wrong. They might have a good point [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2669.98s)]
*  Just look into it. I actually agree. I also think actually that's why I actually think well, hang on. Hang on [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2676.1400000000003s)]
*  I actually think to broaden that that [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2680.6200000000003s)]
*  When I look at people who come from left or right [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2683.34s)]
*  The real ultimate litmus test for me is are they prepared to criticize their own side about anything because if they're not [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2685.9s)]
*  They're not being honest brokers [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2692.86s)]
*  Every side has its problems [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2695.26s)]
*  Everyone on that side should be open and honest enough to say this is wrong when their side drops a ball or does something wrong [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2697.34s)]
*  Look after jake left his job as the spokesman for hooters [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2705.82s)]
*  He went on to be the spokesman for a democratic congresswoman [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2709.1800000000003s)]
*  Hillary clinton's mother-in-law as a matter of fact, and now he's writing a book called president biden's decline its cover-up [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2712.1400000000003s)]
*  I think it should be my cover-up of his decline [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2719.02s)]
*  But he's facing backlash both from people who see that interview with laura trump that you just played and getting whacked for it [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2722.38s)]
*  rightly so but secondly [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2728.62s)]
*  The publisher is facing a ton of criticism for actually allowing this book to come out [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2730.62s)]
*  And exposing joe biden to something that we didn't need a medical degree to see anyone with eyes and ears [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2735.66s)]
*  Saw his cognitive and physical decline and for jake tappert to deny it now and try to profit it off [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2741.42s)]
*  Is ridiculous and absurd and hypocritical. Okay, natalie your thoughts [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2747.18s)]
*  Well, look this is industrial grade projection [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2753.2599999999998s)]
*  The only sin is what the media did for the last four years in terms of lying about joe biden [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2755.74s)]
*  I think this book would probably be better published as an autobiography [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2760.22s)]
*  Because jake tapper played an instrumental role and frankly I would [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2764.3799999999997s)]
*  Start the tape not just on the interview interview that you played but go back to president trump's [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2767.74s)]
*  First term where jake tapper would interview these radical democrat members of congress who would go on and say things like jamey raskin [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2772.2200000000003s)]
*  Saying that president trump should be impeached under the 25th [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2779.02s)]
*  Amendment because he's mentally unwell or mentally unfit to be president of the united states and jake tapper during that interview [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2782.62s)]
*  Sat there did not push back one bit [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2790.3s)]
*  It's a double standard [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2792.94s)]
*  But frankly you come to expect it and I think to link it back to frankly all the stories [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2794.14s)]
*  That we've been discussing there's this weird to sort of use an intel community term limited hangout [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2798.38s)]
*  I think that we're seeing come from people who have really I think made their careers off of opposing president trump [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2803.26s)]
*  The populist kind of maga movement whether it's the zuckerbergs of the world the sort of tech oligarchs [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2808.94s)]
*  But now even here you have figures in media [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2813.98s)]
*  Trying to act like they were really heavy-handed or even fair-handed and tough in their approach to joe biden two democrats [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2816.38s)]
*  And i'm sorry, but it's just not true. So I don't really know what audience he's trying to [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2823.26s)]
*  Well, i'm actually going to bring out because maga does not have a short [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2827.26s)]
*  Well, i'm going to bring out i'm going to bring out a rival book called. I told you [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2830.3s)]
*  Uh, which will be all my columns for the new york post. I i mean a lot that I wrote about joe biden's [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2834.0600000000004s)]
*  Cognitive problems and why he wasn't fit to be president of united states and i'm not even american [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2841.1000000000004s)]
*  And I could tell he wasn't fit to be your president. So i'm afraid it was there in place [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2846.38s)]
*  Everyone could see it. He kept falling over. He kept saying stupid stuff [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2851.1800000000003s)]
*  They get you know, everything about his behavior [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2855.74s)]
*  screened [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2859.0s)]
*  cognitive problems and [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2860.2s)]
*  Rapid decline and the people who tried to pretend otherwise when we had that debate last summer there it was [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2862.3799999999997s)]
*  Suddenly the great lie about biden's cognitive ability was laid bare and what happened total mayhem for the democrats [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2869.98s)]
*  He had to go they parachute in carmela harris. She's no good [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2877.58s)]
*  They get a whacking trump's president again and it all came down to the fact they all conspired to lie to the american people [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2881.8199999999997s)]
*  About the state of biden's health. No [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2887.98s)]
*  No, no, I think I think that I think I think that [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2890.54s)]
*  75 which for you is great pierce 75 of what you just said is true [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2894.6s)]
*  But I think there's some pieces here that that that I think we have to consider. That's a good percentage [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2897.66s)]
*  Actually, that clip you showed. Yeah. Hey for you man. This is this is like record. It's the um [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2901.9s)]
*  You are first of all, the clip we showed was from october of 2020 right that's before [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2908.2200000000003s)]
*  Uh a reelection decision that's before uh, president biden becomes president biden and I think at that moment [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2913.5s)]
*  Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Let me just repeat what they say in the blurb for the book [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2919.98s)]
*  What you will learn makes president buzz decision to run for reelection [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2925.9s)]
*  Seems shockingly narcissistic self-delusional and reckless that decision was taken long before that interview took place [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2930.7999999999997s)]
*  That interview was from october of 2020 it showed on the screen did I misread it yeah [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2940.48s)]
*  October 2020 is when is when ran for the election and defeated trump. Well, okay, he ran for election as well in 2020 [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2946.56s)]
*  Okay, all right [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2957.2s)]
*  For real let me let me just [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2960.24s)]
*  Hang on i'm gonna give you a win. I misread it. I misread it [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2964.16s)]
*  I thought they were talking about a decision to run. Okay, so you're right. Thank you. You're right [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2967.52s)]
*  Now it's an important clarification. I won one you won. I'm giving I'm giving you that i'm giving you that I misread it [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2971.68s)]
*  They're talking about a decision, but let me get back to my more important point. Yes [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2977.92s)]
*  Your point is your point is not your point is not an unfair one [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2981.7599999999998s)]
*  Because actually I guess jake tappell would say well it wasn't as obvious in october 2020 as it is now [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2986.48s)]
*  That's all i'm trying to say joe biden did win the election the month after that interview [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2992.48s)]
*  So clearly the american people did not think it was that obvious even though he was hiding in a bunker at the time [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=2997.04s)]
*  and that's [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3002.24s)]
*  And piers that's that's exactly where i'm going. I'm saying at the time of the interview just showed [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3003.84s)]
*  Biden was aging and personally, I didn't think he was as strong as he should have been to be president [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3007.52s)]
*  I don't think anybody or almost anybody at that age is strong enough to be president in all the ways [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3011.44s)]
*  But at that point he wasn't at the decline and I think it was reasonable for journalists [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3015.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't care what political persuasion you have for journalists to say hey until we have a medical [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3020.3199999999997s)]
*  uh a certainty here or at least a medical insight here let's not [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3025.04s)]
*  Let's not essentially claim that that he's seen. Okay. Well, you know what? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3030.3199999999997s)]
*  2020 to 2022 [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3033.9199999999996s)]
*  Now you do need to be an expert [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3039.12s)]
*  I'm saying the bottom line is jakey's gonna get asked these questions. He'll be able to answer [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3041.12s)]
*  I'll be interested in what he has to say about it [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3047.12s)]
*  Because he's a smart guy and it'll be i'm sure a very readable book [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3049.12s)]
*  But the bigger picture is really how the mainstream media collectively I think deliberately went out of their way to mask it as that second [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3051.92s)]
*  Uh, well the the four years of his tenure as president how that unraveled it was very quickly obvious to a lot of people including [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3060.64s)]
*  Me with the columns I wrote this guy was suffering [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3068.08s)]
*  That's all i'm saying. Yeah, I get it. I get it. It wasn't all a conspiracy. Some of us didn't know either [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3070.7999999999997s)]
*  I get it. I get some of us had our suspicions. I get it. I hear you. That's all i'm saying [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3075.04s)]
*  I've given you one win. You're not getting another one. They let's turn to ali ballwin. I'll take it [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3078.48s)]
*  Let's turn to ali ballwin. Um, because he's got this new show out, uh reality show on discovery plus the bald wins [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3084.0s)]
*  Just had its season premiere. Let's take a look at the clip [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3091.3599999999997s)]
*  Okay, do you want me to look up a haircut for you [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3094.08s)]
*  No, show me the picture that carmen said that they think the boys should i want to see it [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3096.08s)]
*  No, she didn't send a picture for you. These children are like five. You want her to send you a picture for you? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3098.88s)]
*  Yes, I actually do. Okay. I'm calling her telling her. Yeah. I wonder why i'm here arna [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3103.44s)]
*  Daddy feels left out that you didn't send a haircut for him [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3109.68s)]
*  You get the same one as well. Yeah, I love you. Bye. Is it with carmen those kids five years old send an age appropriate [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3112.96s)]
*  Picture of him, okay, you can't actually endure much more of that. That's pretty much the highlight of the whole thing. What's extraordinary? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3118.0s)]
*  Only 10 minutes or so of that episode are given over to his shooting of the rust cinematographer helena hutchins [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3122.88s)]
*  But most of that is in relation to alec ballwin suffering ptsd [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3129.84s)]
*  From shooting that woman and how he needs to be able to move on [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3135.28s)]
*  Jason, I mean i've been in the show for a long time [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3139.36s)]
*  I mean i've been very critical of ballwin from when that happened onwards because he's constantly positioned himself [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3141.92s)]
*  As the real victim here and obviously the victim is the woman he shot [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3148.1600000000003s)]
*  Alec ballwin is suffering the same thing a lot of leftists are are are suffering [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3156.6400000000003s)]
*  The world has dramatically changed. They're not as in control of the world as they are in the world [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3161.92s)]
*  The world has dramatically changed [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3167.2s)]
*  They're not as in control of the matrix as they used to be elon musk take over from twitter turning into x [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3169.2s)]
*  Has changed the way conversations unfold in public the the the the [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3178.0s)]
*  Marketplace of ideas has been expanded the overton window and so he's doing this [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3184.48s)]
*  Whatever series with netflix or whatever to try to portray himself as the average normal [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3189.12s)]
*  Average normal. Hey have sympathy for me the american public [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3194.56s)]
*  Will fall for it anymore [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3198.96s)]
*  There's going to be a real discussion about how phony and fake this guy is and how this whole thing is manufactured [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3200.48s)]
*  And he's going to have a difficult time [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3207.04s)]
*  Rehabilitating his image because now we're all free to have legitimate discussions over social media [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3209.66s)]
*  And analyze these people not against these algorithms that were so big to favor the left [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3216.72s)]
*  And if you criticize their sacred cows you were shouted down you were framed as outside the norm [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3222.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's gonna have to deal with the new reality people aren't gonna fall for this. Okay, we're running out of time [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3229.2000000000003s)]
*  Sean, I know you have to go. So just leave me with your thoughts [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3233.6800000000003s)]
*  I'll just read you some of the reviews which have been some of the worst reviews i've ever seen for any television ever produced [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3236.0s)]
*  In the history of the medium, uh, the uh vulture said the ball was is grimmer than you imagined [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3241.6800000000003s)]
*  Telegraph said it was self-pitying attempt to image rehabilitation [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3247.84s)]
*  The daily mail says simply what hideous people and even the guardian and if you lose the guardian when you're a lefty like morgan [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3251.04s)]
*  Even the guardian called it a new low for television [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3257.68s)]
*  Think about how much crap we've seen on television and this is a new low your thoughts on before you go [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3261.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it says something that joy reed loses her show and he gets to keep doing this crap [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3266.32s)]
*  I don't know who's going to watch it. My guess is it doesn't stay around very long. It's unwatchable [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3270.48s)]
*  She's ridiculous the whole thing the idea that anybody thinks giving them a deal because it's not just him. It's her as well is insane [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3275.46s)]
*  And I just want to talk to you very very quickly about something completely different which is breaking [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3282.9s)]
*  As we as we're doing this which is these two brothers andrew and tristan tate [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3286.98s)]
*  Who are facing serious charges of sex trafficking rape and other things have uh been allowed to fly from rumania to florida [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3292.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh today they've just landed andrew tate has said my brother and I are largely misunderstood now the governor of florida ron [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3300.52s)]
*  De santis has responded by saying the reality is florida is not a place where you are welcome [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3307.62s)]
*  Talking about the tates with that type of conduct. I don't know how it came to this [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3313.64s)]
*  I found out through the media this was happening [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3317.8s)]
*  And he's now looking into it [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3320.2799999999997s)]
*  Um, this is an ongoing pretty moveable feast. I talked, uh to alina haber the [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3321.8s)]
*  Counselor to president donald trump who was being very flattering to andrew tate on benny johnson show only last month [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3327.56s)]
*  And many people think the white house has somehow [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3334.2799999999997s)]
*  engineered [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3337.38s)]
*  uh this [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3338.44s)]
*  Freedom flight if you like because you'll now escape justice in rumania with his brother or whatever justice may may have been [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3339.7999999999997s)]
*  We don't know they they protested their innocence, but they now won't have to face any criminal proceeding there if they stay in america [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3345.88s)]
*  What do you think of this? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3351.64s)]
*  Look I think a lot of people who are public figures end up being misunderstood to some extent [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3354.04s)]
*  uh the tate brother is not an example of that because [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3360.52s)]
*  andrew tate has [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3363.96s)]
*  Streamed so many episodes of his show if you can call it that where he literally brags about manipulating women [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3365.56s)]
*  tricking women into essentially being part of his like [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3373.3199999999997s)]
*  you know harem of women that he [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3377.72s)]
*  He [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3379.88s)]
*  Anyway makes money off of let's just put it that way. I don't want to get too crude here [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3381.0800000000004s)]
*  But he brags about it. I mean he himself there's endless evidence to prove it and honestly [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3385.0s)]
*  I don't know what donald trump is doing here. Like why would you associate yourself with these people? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3390.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like he needlessly brings on [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3396.52s)]
*  Criticism, right? You don't need to associate yourself with the tates and you don't need to bring them here to the united states from [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3399.78s)]
*  Romania where they're facing serious charges. Okay, natalie quick response. We've run out of time, but this just dropped so natalie your response to that [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3405.16s)]
*  Look I think if the trump administration had been intimately involved with bringing him over here, you know [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3414.12s)]
*  Every civil servant bureaucrat there they would be leaking profusely. It would be the lead story on every mainstream media outlet [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3419.24s)]
*  I don't speak for the white house. I don't know. I don't think that they were involved in this like alina haba said [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3425.48s)]
*  It's the romanian justice department that allowed them to fly here [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCsOLsB1MXU&t=3430.3599999999997s)]
