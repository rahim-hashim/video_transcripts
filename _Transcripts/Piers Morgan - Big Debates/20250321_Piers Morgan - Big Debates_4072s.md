Video Description: The common parlance of the American Right contains quite a few novel adages these days. ‘Make America Great Again’ is the main call to arms, and ‘Let’s Go Brandon’ expresses a pseudo-secret resistance to Joe Biden. 

Another, is a warning to fellow capitalists ‘Go Woke Go Broke’. Dylan Mulvaney’s disastrous team-up with Bud Light is the exemplar of the rule, but then again, the socially progressive ice cream giant Ben & Jerry’s has doubled its profits in the last ten years. So does this prophecy hold weight? Piers Morgan wants to know.

Joining Uncensored to discuss brand social activism is co-founder of Ben and Jerry’s Ben Cohen and former Anheuser-Busch executive Anson Frericks. 

Piers is then joined by a precisely selected range of experts and culture vultures to tackle Disney's new 'woke' Snow White; Uncensored contributor Esther Krakue, content creators Gary Buechler aka Nerdrotic and Will Jordan aka The Critical Drinker, author of The Case for Cancel Culture Ernest Owens, wrestler and actor Dylan Postl aka Hornswoggle and publisher of Film Threat Chris Gore.

# “Why Don’t You Just Sell Ice Cream?!” Piers Morgan GRILLS Ben & Jerry’s Founder + Snow White FLOPS!
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM)
*  We can start out with the creative bankruptcy of remaking another animated classic instead of making something new. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=0.0s)]
*  You know what, she'd be beautiful, she should turn up on set, her skin should be white as snow, and she shouldn't... [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=12.64s)]
*  What's next, a bald Rapunzel? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=16.52s)]
*  The dwarves are an ungodly nightmare. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=17.96s)]
*  These were dream roles. Seven dream roles in a major production. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=21.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=26.76s)]
*  A major production. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  It's the complete absurdity of modern Hollywood. They are so desperate not to offend anyone that they end up screwing up. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=28.64s)]
*  Why don't you just sell ice cream? Are you going to return your building to the people on whose land is at your foot? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=35.28s)]
*  No. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=40.92s)]
*  Wow. Should that land be handed back to Ukraine on principle? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=42.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=47.4s)]
*  Go woke, go broke has become a popular way of describing the massive consumer backlash to corporations who, for some reason, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=50.64s)]
*  lose a lot of money after selling their customers their all racist bigots. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  You might be hearing it a lot in the next few days as Disney's sanitized Snow White remake finally hits theaters, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=60.63999999999999s)]
*  and made what critics say is the biggest PR disaster in movie history. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=66.28s)]
*  Much more on that later. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=70.56s)]
*  We'll begin with an intriguing debate about so-called corporate activism and two businesses, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=71.96s)]
*  or two business titans with very different views on whether brands should brandish their virtuous liberal worldviews. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=76.92s)]
*  Anson Ferenc was a top executive at AB InBev for 11 years. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=83.48s)]
*  He had a front row seat for the Dylan Mulvaney debacle, which sparked the collapse of America's top beer at a cost of billions. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=88.12s)]
*  His new book, Last Call for Bud Light, charts a rapid rise and recent fall of corporate DEI. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=94.96s)]
*  Ben Cohen is the co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, one of the world's most famous ice cream brands. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=101.16s)]
*  Besides selling creamy indulgences, Ben & Jerry's campaigns for the return of stolen lands to indigenous Americans [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=106.16s)]
*  and dismantling of the white supremacy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=112.0s)]
*  So welcome to both of you, two successful men with very different views about this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=114.16s)]
*  Ben Cohen, first of all, thank you for coming on. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=119.84s)]
*  As you know, I ripped into you in a New York Post column, I think it was a year or two ago, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=122.16s)]
*  about your wokest activities and was extremely uncomplimentary. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=128.6s)]
*  So I admire a man who's prepared to come and face the music and feel free to rip me back. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=133.24s)]
*  But just on a general point, Ben & Jerry's have been extremely active in this area. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=138.84s)]
*  Interestingly, unlike a lot of the other companies that have gone down this route or tested the water with it, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=145.96s)]
*  you don't seem, Ben & Jerry's, to have suffered any negative backlash, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=152.44s)]
*  which is probably one of the reasons why you keep doing it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  But do you accept that a lot of other companies have tripped up spectacularly by dipping their toes into the woke waters? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think what we're talking about is fairness and justice. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=169.44s)]
*  There is a bunch of people in our society that have been oppressed, that have been discriminated against, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=176.12s)]
*  women, people of color. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=185.52s)]
*  And, you know, I think business is really the most powerful force in our society. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=187.84s)]
*  And business has a responsibility to help to undo the wrongs that have been done in the society and help to repair the society. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=194.92s)]
*  Why don't you just sell ice cream? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I like your ice cream. I've eaten a lot of your ice cream. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=210.24s)]
*  I will continue to eat it despite your wokeism. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=214.16s)]
*  But as I think I ended my column for the post, it's like, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=217.8s)]
*  why should an ice cream company feel it's part of their remit to constantly harangue us about issues and social activism? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=220.8s)]
*  Well, we're talking about standing up for what I thought were basic American values of freedom, justice, equality. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  You know, business, as I say, is the most powerful force in the society. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  Business controls our legislation through lobbying. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  It controls who gets elected through campaign donations. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=251.84s)]
*  Business is a very political creature. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  It's just that usually it's done covertly. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=258.48s)]
*  And at Ben & Jerry's, we do it overtly and we say we are a values led company. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=261.96s)]
*  These are the values that drive us, along with making great ice cream and making a profit. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=268.52s)]
*  But are you also a hypocrisy company? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=275.8s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=279.96s)]
*  In 2022, July 4th, Independence Day, a great day for Americans, a terrible day if you're British. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=281.52s)]
*  If it hadn't been for that George III moment of madness, I think I could have well been king of your country by now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=289.56s)]
*  And you might have been a lot better off for it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=297.56s)]
*  But on Independence Day, the great day in America's calendar, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  Ben & Jerry's demanded that Mount Rushmore be returned to Native Americans. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=304.6s)]
*  And it all sounded, you know, OK, you've got this big speech you guys made and you want stolen indigenous land to be returned. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=309.88s)]
*  You want to dismantle white supremacy, systems of oppression. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=318.04s)]
*  And then somebody went, well, hang on a second, hang on, because Ben & Jerry's corporate HQ in Vermont is built on the ancestral home of the Abenaki people, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=321.08s)]
*  where 3200 still reside. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=331.44s)]
*  And they've now demanded reparations from you. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=334.12s)]
*  We are a place based people, they said. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=337.2s)]
*  We are the ones who are in this place. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=339.52s)]
*  So I'm assuming that as part of your civic duty for American values, Ben, you will be returning your HQ to the Abenaki people as a matter of urgency, will you? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=341.12s)]
*  Well, the point that we've been making is that... [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=354.35999999999996s)]
*  Hang on, are you going to return your building to the people on whose land is put? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=358.16s)]
*  It's a serious question. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=363.32s)]
*  No. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=366.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=367.72s)]
*  First of all, we don't own the building. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=369.0s)]
*  But what we're trying to say is that the US made treaties with Native Americans that the US has kind of ignored. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=373.16s)]
*  I get it. But why shouldn't the same rules apply to Ben & Jerry's buildings? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=383.48s)]
*  Why should you be exempt? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=387.32s)]
*  Well, I think that it's a government issue. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=389.52s)]
*  I think that it's the government that made these treaties with... [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  Really? It's not a principle, then? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  Say what? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=399.12s)]
*  It's not a principle, then. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=399.92s)]
*  It's just you want the government to do it, not you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, I'm saying I'd like the government to live up to its agreements. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=404.2s)]
*  Yeah, but this is my problem. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  With all due respect, this is my problem with the woke brigade. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=408.96s)]
*  And I say that respectfully. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  Actually, I'm not even sure I do. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=414.52s)]
*  Because it always seems to be littered with rank hypocrisy. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=416.20000000000005s)]
*  And I'll give you another example. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=419.8s)]
*  If you really believe that stolen land should be returned to people, why did you support Ukraine not being given their land back? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=420.88000000000005s)]
*  You personally donated... [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  I want to be... [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=434.68s)]
*  You personally gave a million dollars to a group trying to end Western arm shipments to Ukraine. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  Does that not, again? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=441.48s)]
*  Again? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=442.8s)]
*  Just fly in the face of your supposed great high moral principle. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=443.16s)]
*  Why would you not want Ukraine to have its land back? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=447.68s)]
*  Well, I don't think anybody gave a million dollars to anybody. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=451.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, at least not from Ben and Jerry's. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=455.48s)]
*  Well, you personally donated a million to a group that is literally trying to end Western arm shipments to Ukraine. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, I do support the Eisenhower Media Network. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=466.24s)]
*  It's a group of retired high-level military officers. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=471.28000000000003s)]
*  And that group took out an ad at the very beginning of the war in Ukraine saying, let's have peace. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=476.88s)]
*  Let's stop fighting. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=487.76s)]
*  And let's talk together. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  And let's figure this out. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=491.6s)]
*  And that Russia has legitimate security concerns, just like the US has legitimate security concerns. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=493.0s)]
*  And Ukraine does too. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=501.16s)]
*  Shouldn't Ukraine's sovereign territory land, by your principle, be handed back to Ukraine, the stuff that Russia's stolen? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=502.36s)]
*  It's exactly the same principle, surely, as the indigenous land being taken from them that you made a huge campaign about. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=512.0s)]
*  When people steal somebody else's land, isn't your principle, Benko, in that you have to give it back? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=519.36s)]
*  So why would you feel the opposite about Ukraine? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=526.12s)]
*  What we believe about Ukraine is that that was a war that was provoked by United States policies. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=531.16s)]
*  And I want to be clear. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=539.04s)]
*  This is not Ben and Jerry's. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  This is Ben. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=542.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=543.2s)]
*  Ben and Jerry's has taken no stand on the issue. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=543.68s)]
*  So does Jerry not agree with you? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=545.68s)]
*  I don't know where Jerry's at, actually. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=550.52s)]
*  I haven't discussed it with him. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=552.36s)]
*  Yes, you do. Don't tell me you don't know. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=554.2s)]
*  What do you think? Of course you do. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=555.36s)]
*  But my point is, what about the land that Vladimir Putin has stolen with his murderous barbaric rampage? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=557.0s)]
*  Surely, the Ben and Jerry's corporate position should be, as it is with the indigenous people, the land should be handed back to Ukraine. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=563.84s)]
*  Who owns it? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=573.08s)]
*  Ben and Jerry's has not taken a position on Ukraine. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=576.24s)]
*  Right, but what do you think? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=579.88s)]
*  You know, all wars end in a negotiated settlement. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=581.08s)]
*  I get that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=585.0s)]
*  But you think the land should be handed back? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=585.84s)]
*  What we were suggesting happen is that let's have the negotiating settlement before the war. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=587.84s)]
*  I get it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=594.08s)]
*  Before we have to kill hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  But before I go into answers, we'll be waiting very patiently. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  Should that land be handed back to Ukraine on principle? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=598.5600000000001s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=699.3199999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=701.12s)]
*  Look, viewers can make their own minds up, but it seems like there's a lot of swirling double standards going on here. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=702.12s)]
*  Anson, let me bring you in here. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=708.28s)]
*  You know, we know what happened with the Bud Light fiasco. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=710.68s)]
*  I could have told everybody at Bud Light this was going to happen. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=713.28s)]
*  You put Dylan Mulvaney, who until Dylan Mulvaney was 26 was a gay man, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=716.76s)]
*  and then suddenly says, oh, actually, I'm now going to be a woman. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=722.64s)]
*  You put them in charge of one of the more ludicrous social media campaigns [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=725.8s)]
*  I think I've ever seen a company embark on, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=730.24s)]
*  which flew in the face of everything that Bud Light kind of stood for. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=732.4399999999999s)]
*  And you end up with Kid Rock firing a machine gun, Bud Light bottles, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=736.72s)]
*  and a catastrophic drop in sales, down 30%, I think, in the year after, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=741.08s)]
*  lost its position as number one. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=747.56s)]
*  And it reminded me of what happened with Gillette when they did the same thing [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=750.3199999999999s)]
*  and basically told all their customers like me [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=753.52s)]
*  that you're all a bunch of Harvey Weinsteins until you can prove otherwise [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=756.28s)]
*  in the most damning, sneering commercial imaginable. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=759.76s)]
*  And then when they lost nine billion worth of business, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=763.84s)]
*  they reversed and went back to big he-men clutching babies, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=767.08s)]
*  which was pretty much what I wanted to see, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=770.24s)]
*  because I wanted to feel good about being a man, not shamed. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=772.6s)]
*  So, look, what's your view of this? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=775.96s)]
*  Yeah, so what this comes down to for me, Piers, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=779.4s)]
*  it's really about brand and authenticity. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=781.12s)]
*  Do I necessarily like the hypocrisy of Ben and Jerry's? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=783.32s)]
*  Do I like what I think of some flawed political stances? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=785.72s)]
*  No, but I do actually respect Ben a lot. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=788.88s)]
*  I actually write about this a ton in my book. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=790.88s)]
*  I respect their company because at least they're very authentic [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=792.64s)]
*  to what they've always been, which they sell ice cream [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  to advance a socially progressive mission. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=798.2s)]
*  I mean, they put it right on their website. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=800.36s)]
*  So there's no hiding what they're doing. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=801.88s)]
*  And on their website, they say that we're going to support [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=803.5200000000001s)]
*  the Black Lives Matter movement, that we're going to support basically [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=806.08s)]
*  that we're going to support biological men competing against women in sports. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=811.08s)]
*  It's right on their website and they're using ice cream to do it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=815.1600000000001s)]
*  And they have names like Empowerment for voting rights issues [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=817.2800000000001s)]
*  and Pecan Resist to Resist the Trump Agenda. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=820.44s)]
*  I actually don't have an issue with Ben and Jerry's and their branding. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=823.0400000000001s)]
*  That's their brand. That's their customer. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=825.64s)]
*  Some people like that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=827.2800000000001s)]
*  It's a free country and you can compete with whoever you want. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=828.2800000000001s)]
*  The issue that I have, and this is the issue with what happened with Bud Light, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=830.6800000000001s)]
*  it's when companies that aren't authentically what Ben and Jerry's was, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=833.88s)]
*  which is a socially political brand, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=837.44s)]
*  when all of a sudden that they were foisted on them, an agenda to be politicized. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=839.4s)]
*  And I get all the reasons why, where there's really a, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=843.28s)]
*  it was almost a group of asset managers like BlackRock, State Street, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=846.0s)]
*  Vanderbilt pushing ESG agenda. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=849.84s)]
*  You had all these consulting companies like McKinsey and Bain [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=851.68s)]
*  that were promoting DEI consulting services and selling there. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=854.4399999999999s)]
*  You got all these activist groups, the Human Rights Campaign and others [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=858.12s)]
*  that Ben and Jerry's and other support, putting a lot of pressure on companies [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=861.28s)]
*  to adopt essentially the same exact policies that Ben and Jerry's had [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=864.68s)]
*  for brands like Bud Light that had nothing to do with social activism. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=867.52s)]
*  I mean, if you take a look at Bud Light, their whole point was to be easy to drink and easy to enjoy. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=870.0s)]
*  They became the biggest beer brand in America [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=874.64s)]
*  precisely because they were not involved in politics. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=876.88s)]
*  They were involved in things that brought folks together like sports and music and humor. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=879.64s)]
*  That's what they were all about. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=883.72s)]
*  So then all of a sudden, when this company does a partnership with Dylan Mulvaney, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=885.24s)]
*  who's a very controversial transgender influencer, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=889.24s)]
*  who was essentially had really nothing to do with beer [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=892.9200000000001s)]
*  and somebody who was at the forefront and at Joe Biden's White House [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=896.2s)]
*  of advocating for gender affirmation care and then also advocating for biological men [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=899.36s)]
*  to compete against women in sports. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=903.9200000000001s)]
*  All of a sudden, the Bud Light consumer stepped back and said, wait a minute, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=905.24s)]
*  like, this isn't the brand that I drink. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=907.5200000000001s)]
*  But like me, it was more historically about sports and UFC and all that stuff. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=909.36s)]
*  What happened? And I think that's where Bud Light got lost. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=913.96s)]
*  And that's where you have to start making distinctions about you as a brand. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=916.2s)]
*  You have to stand for something. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=918.76s)]
*  Ben and Jerry's stands for political activism and maybe hypocrisy. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=919.96s)]
*  But I think Bud Light was supposed to be easy to drink, easy to enjoy. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=924.16s)]
*  It was different. And then other brands on the right, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=926.36s)]
*  you have brands like Black Rifle Coffee Company, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=928.44s)]
*  which their whole mission is they want to serve coffee and culture to firefighters, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=930.32s)]
*  military, police officers, people who love America. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=933.72s)]
*  Let those companies, let Black Rifle be Black Rifle. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=936.24s)]
*  Let Bud Light be Bud Light. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=938.96s)]
*  Let Ben and Jerry's be Ben and Jerry's. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=940.28s)]
*  But don't necessarily have every company have to get Ben and Jerry's [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=942.0s)]
*  in terms of the policies that they've had. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=945.0s)]
*  That's where corporate America went wrong over the last couple of years. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=946.5600000000001s)]
*  Ben, do you think that some of the positions that Ben and Jerry's took, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=949.84s)]
*  I mean, take the issue of transgender athletes in women's sport, for example. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=954.2800000000001s)]
*  Pretty much everyone I know now, even Gavin Newsom has done a U-turn on this, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=958.6s)]
*  who's the king of woke in terms of politics. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=962.5200000000001s)]
*  Do you think with reflection that it is grotesquely unfair [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=966.1600000000001s)]
*  for biological males who identify as trans women to compete in women's sport? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=971.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, I don't really know enough about the issue. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=980.08s)]
*  But it's a Ben and Jerry's policy, isn't it? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=983.32s)]
*  You support it. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=986.1600000000001s)]
*  It...it...it...it...it well may be, but all I'm saying is that I personally... [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=988.08s)]
*  You don't know? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=994.88s)]
*  ..uh, not...not positively, no. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=996.36s)]
*  Wow! [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=999.32s)]
*  I think...I think that, uh, I would kind of leave it to the people [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1000.84s)]
*  that are playing the sports. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1006.4s)]
*  Let them decide. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1008.32s)]
*  Well, how do you do that if you let the trans athletes [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1009.64s)]
*  compete in women's sport and...and...and beat women? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1012.04s)]
*  Well, you let the...the teams, the whole group that's playing, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1015.52s)]
*  let them decide. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1019.0s)]
*  So that you don't have any official position at all? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1020.92s)]
*  Because the point was the...the Biden administration actively supported it, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1022.92s)]
*  so nothing was going to happen until you had a president like Trump come along [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1027.2s)]
*  and say, this is ridiculous. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1030.52s)]
*  I'm surprised you don't even know whether Ben and Jerry's supported that. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1032.44s)]
*  And...and so, I'll answer that for you, peers. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1037.28s)]
*  They do. It's on their website right now. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1039.76s)]
*  You can see that Ben and Jerry's, they're proud supporter of the Human Rights Campaign, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1041.36s)]
*  which is a group that, on their website today, it says that there is no issue [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1044.52s)]
*  with transgender athletes competing in sports. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1047.96s)]
*  Yet, all of a sudden, you know, it was only two years ago you had Leah Thomas, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1050.52s)]
*  who took a medal away from Riley Gaines, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1053.36s)]
*  and then I think in 2019, it was one of the first instances, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1055.32s)]
*  um, there was a...there was a transgender person named C.C. Taufar [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1058.04s)]
*  that beforehand, in 2017 to 2018, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1062.04s)]
*  competed in men's hurdles in the 400 metres [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1064.56s)]
*  and then ended up winning the gold that year. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1066.6s)]
*  It's all completely ridiculous. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1068.4s)]
*  I mean, there are eight... I think it was the UN... [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1070.0s)]
*  The UN did a report recently saying, I think, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1072.4s)]
*  nearly 900 medals have been taken away from female competitors around the world [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1075.04s)]
*  because trans athletes had won. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1080.76s)]
*  And that's just simply unfair. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1084.48s)]
*  But, Ben, I'm curious about this, because you are the Ben of Ben and Jerry's, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1086.08s)]
*  and yet here you are, apparently, seemingly oblivious [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1091.24s)]
*  to these very strident but controversial positions [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1094.3600000000001s)]
*  that your company is taking. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1098.1200000000001s)]
*  Do you not feel a little bit queasy about that? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1099.88s)]
*  Well, you know, I believe in transgender rights. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1102.2s)]
*  Um, I know that the company believes in transgender rights. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1106.72s)]
*  Do you believe in women's rights? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1111.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Do you believe in women's rights to fairness and equality and safety? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1113.3600000000001s)]
*  Yes. So, I mean, do you have... [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1118.88s)]
*  I don't know your story, but do you have any daughters or...? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1121.52s)]
*  I do. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1124.52s)]
*  Would you be happy if suddenly a biological male got in a boxing ring with them, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1125.6s)]
*  if they were a boxer, and started beating them up as we... [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1130.56s)]
*  No. We saw it happen in the Paris Olympics. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1133.1599999999999s)]
*  I know we can laugh about it, but I watched the Paris Olympics [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1136.04s)]
*  and there was an Algerian boxer in the female category [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1140.4399999999998s)]
*  who was banned from the world championships for testing positive for male chromosomes, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1144.52s)]
*  and she beat up a young Italian female fighter so badly, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1149.2s)]
*  she quit after 40 seconds thinking she was going to die. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1153.8400000000001s)]
*  So, this has real-time consequence. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1157.68s)]
*  And if Ben & Jerry's is going to be this big social activist company [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1159.88s)]
*  preaching to us all about these big issues, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1164.48s)]
*  A, I'd expect you to know, as one of the founders, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1167.3200000000002s)]
*  what those issues are. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1170.28s)]
*  I'm surprised you don't. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1171.8400000000001s)]
*  And B, I would expect Ben & Jerry's to reflect on some of the positions it's taken [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1173.28s)]
*  and accept, as many, many other people are now doing, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1177.84s)]
*  you were just plain wrong. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1180.72s)]
*  Well, I would say that these are not really big issues. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1182.9199999999998s)]
*  These are issues that are used to hide the big issues. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1188.04s)]
*  I would say the big issues are our country is spending $900 billion a year, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1191.84s)]
*  half of our entire discretionary federal budget, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1199.04s)]
*  on the Pentagon, on getting ready to kill loads of people just like us [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1204.48s)]
*  in other countries. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1211.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't know where you went. All I see is me on the screen. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1212.64s)]
*  No, we're back. We're just giving you the full screen [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1216.44s)]

*  Good sleep, as I can confirm, is the foundation of physical and mental health. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1234.0s)]
*  Our daily performance depends on it. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1238.44s)]
*  That's why we are delighted to talk about Beam's Dream Powder, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1240.48s)]
*  a science-backed, healthy hot cocoa for sleep. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1244.16s)]
*  It's tested for high quality efficiency and formulated to ease your body into rest, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1247.24s)]
*  supporting the four stages of the sleep cycle [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1252.52s)]
*  to help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1255.16s)]
*  Many other sleep aids cause next day grogginess, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1258.04s)]
*  but Dream contains a powerful, all-natural blend of [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1260.52s)]

*  Now, on with the show. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1291.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1294.96s)]
*  So what I was saying was that these are not really big issues. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1295.72s)]
*  It doesn't involve a whole lot of people. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1300.36s)]
*  But when you talk about how they're spending our money, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1303.04s)]
*  how the government is spending our money, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1306.52s)]
*  taking half of all of the discretionary budget to create a war machine [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1310.2s)]
*  that just kind of benefits war profiteers at the expense of everybody else, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1318.44s)]
*  I would say that's a big issue that we ought to be concerned about [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1324.0s)]
*  instead of being distracted. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1327.68s)]
*  But if it's not a big issue, why is it all over the Ben and Jerry's website? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1329.2s)]
*  Why don't you tell them to take it down if no one cares about it? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1332.4s)]
*  There's lots of issues. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1336.92s)]
*  Some are bigger, some are smaller, as far as I'm concerned. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1338.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1341.6000000000001s)]
*  But that one, to you, is insignificant. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1342.28s)]
*  It shouldn't really be on the website, should it? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1344.2s)]
*  Well, when it's versus spending our national treasure [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1345.8400000000001s)]
*  and our soldiers and our national spirit on preparing to kill millions of people, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1352.88s)]
*  yeah, I think that's a big issue. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1363.64s)]
*  In 2021, Ben and Jerry's announced it was blocking all sales of his ice cream [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1365.28s)]
*  in Israel's West Bank, which he called the Occupied Palestinian Territory. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1369.44s)]
*  So you felt strongly that the West Bank should be just left alone, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1374.24s)]
*  given back because it was Palestinian land, left with the Palestinians? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1378.88s)]
*  We felt like Israel was mistreating the Palestinians. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1382.68s)]
*  But in relation to the land of the West Bank, it was owned by Palestinians [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1387.28s)]
*  and should be returned to them in totality? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1391.4s)]
*  The position that Ben and Jerry's took was that we disagreed with how [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1394.68s)]
*  Israel was treating Palestinians. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1400.2800000000002s)]
*  It was kind of an apartheid system. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1403.88s)]
*  And... [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1408.0s)]
*  But what should happen to the West Bank? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1409.16s)]
*  ...against various UN resolutions... [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1410.64s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1413.72s)]
*  ...against international law. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1414.4s)]
*  I get that. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1415.8400000000001s)]
*  But what should happen to the West Bank, then? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1416.24s)]
*  I don't have an answer to that question. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1419.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1422.3600000000001s)]
*  Really. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1424.44s)]
*  But that was Ben and Jerry's campaign. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1425.6000000000001s)]
*  You literally banned your ice cream from being sold there [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1427.76s)]
*  because you called it Occupied Palestinian Territory. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1431.0400000000002s)]
*  So clearly you feel that the Israelis should get out of the West Bank, right? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1434.6000000000001s)]
*  Otherwise you wouldn't have run back... [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1439.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, we believe in a two-state solution. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1441.1200000000001s)]
*  So do I. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1444.44s)]
*  I don't know where the boundary should be, but... [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1445.16s)]
*  But you called the West Bank an Occupied Palestinian Territory. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1448.3200000000002s)]
*  It is. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1452.72s)]
*  OK. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1453.72s)]
*  Is it not? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1454.24s)]
*  I'm just going to ask you a follow-up. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1455.4s)]
*  OK, so you have an objection to Occupied Territory, do you? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1456.92s)]
*  We certainly have an objection along with the rest of the world and the UN. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1461.3600000000001s)]
*  But do you personally... [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1466.2s)]
*  As a company, you have an objection to the idea of countries occupying [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1468.0800000000002s)]
*  territory that doesn't belong to them, in your eyes? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1473.3200000000002s)]
*  In general, yes. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1480.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that's what was supposed to be... [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1481.2s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1483.04s)]
*  Why is Ukraine not allowed to keep its territory? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1484.44s)]
*  Why would you be happy for Putin to take that? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1487.92s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1490.48s)]
*  I didn't say that. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1493.92s)]
*  What I said was that we were against the war, we called for a ceasefire. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1495.24s)]
*  It was not Ben and Jerry's, it was Ben and the Eisenhower media network [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1502.52s)]
*  that was doing that. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1507.32s)]
*  So should Ukraine have its land back that Putin's taken? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1508.08s)]
*  You know, the way wars work is my understanding and again, I emphasised [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1513.1200000000001s)]
*  that we were totally against this war, which was a war of choice. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1520.04s)]
*  The way wars work is there's a negotiated settlement at the end [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1526.64s)]
*  and somebody gets some territory. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1530.2s)]
*  So that could apply... [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1532.76s)]
*  I mean, what is the alternative? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1533.8400000000001s)]
*  By that criteria, that should apply with the Israel-Hamas War, then, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1536.56s)]
*  which might include landing Gaza land in the West Bank. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1540.1200000000001s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1542.88s)]
*  It's a war and by your yardstick in Ukraine, if some land's been taken, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1543.88s)]
*  well, OK, that's what happens. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1548.5200000000002s)]
*  Well, it wasn't a war at the time. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1550.5600000000002s)]
*  What was happening was that the war was over. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1552.48s)]
*  There was an occupation of the West Bank. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1556.5600000000002s)]
*  Palestinians, it was essentially what the UN called an open air prison. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1562.24s)]
*  There was an incredible amount of poverty. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1567.48s)]
*  People weren't able to earn a living. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1570.16s)]
*  Yeah, we really felt that that was unjust. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1573.68s)]
*  No, I get it. I get it. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1577.5600000000002s)]
*  And many people... [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1579.2s)]
*  Listen, many people would agree with you. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1580.3600000000001s)]
*  Many wouldn't, but many would. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1582.3600000000001s)]
*  But I'm just curious why you would feel that passionately [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1584.1200000000001s)]
*  about the Palestinian people's right to have their land, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1587.3600000000001s)]
*  but you would not feel that Ukrainians should have the right to keep their land. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1591.5200000000002s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1596.0400000000002s)]
*  I never said Ukrainians don't have the right to keep their land. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1597.4s)]
*  So Putin should give it back? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1601.7199999999998s)]
*  What's that? Putin should give it back to them? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1604.0s)]
*  I never said that either. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1607.04s)]
*  Or what do you think? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1609.12s)]
*  I think we ought to stop this war. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1611.24s)]
*  We don't love to stop the war, but what do you think happens to the... [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1613.52s)]
*  What happens to the occupied territory? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1616.56s)]
*  I don't know. OK. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1620.8s)]
*  It's extraordinary. You seem to know very emphatically [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1622.8s)]
*  what you would do with the Palestinian-Israel situation, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1625.6s)]
*  but you don't seem to have a clue what you would do about Ukraine-Russia, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1628.6399999999999s)]
*  even though, to many people's eyes, it's exactly the same. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1631.72s)]
*  You know, many people who argue the case for Palestinian rights to land [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1634.68s)]
*  agree completely that Ukraine has the same right. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1639.92s)]
*  It just seems to me it's a bit of an inconsistency with your positioning. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1643.64s)]
*  Would you accept that? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1647.0s)]
*  Uh, not particularly. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1649.0s)]
*  Like I said, we were opposed to the US provoking that war in Ukraine. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1652.3600000000001s)]
*  That's the position we took. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1659.28s)]
*  And it was not Ben Ejero's position. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1661.48s)]
*  It was my position, along with the Eisenhower Media Network. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1663.68s)]
*  And what we said was, let's stop fighting. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1668.48s)]
*  Let's have a ceasefire. Let's use our words, you know? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1671.68s)]
*  Let's have adults talk to each other and work out a solution, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1675.8s)]
*  as opposed to having to kill a couple hundred thousand people first [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1680.44s)]
*  and spend trillions of dollars in the process. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1684.6399999999999s)]
*  OK. Let me bring Anson back in here. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1688.56s)]
*  This issue going on with Elon Musk and Tesla is kind of fascinating. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1692.76s)]
*  It's not in the same kind of wheelhouse, except that, oddly, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1696.52s)]
*  all the people that used to love Elon Musk, including many on the woke left, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1700.08s)]
*  have now turned on him with a visceral hatred. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1704.96s)]
*  And you're seeing Tesla cars being torched all over America and so on, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1708.04s)]
*  and the share price diving or whatever. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1712.32s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1714.32s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's funny. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1716.8s)]
*  It's the same people that literally two years ago were saying, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1717.52s)]
*  all the conservatives are overreacting by boycotting Bud Light, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1720.2s)]
*  are now burning Tesla's. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1723.4s)]
*  Talk about the hypocrisy that we were talking about earlier. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1725.12s)]
*  It's pretty pretty comical. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1727.96s)]
*  You know, Elon's a tough one to discuss because the guy is the CEO [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1729.4s)]
*  of six different companies. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1734.28s)]
*  And what might be good for some of his businesses by getting involved [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1735.6s)]
*  in politics are not good for other businesses. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1738.44s)]
*  Obviously, in the case of Tesla, it really hasn't been good. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1741.0s)]
*  If you take a look at the share price and then you take a look at some [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1743.48s)]
*  of the resale value of Tesla since he's gotten involved with the Trump [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1746.16s)]
*  administration for Tesla, it really hasn't been good. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1748.8400000000001s)]
*  And I think if Musk was just the CEO of Tesla, I think a lot of people [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1751.4s)]
*  would be saying that, man, like, this is not good for the business. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1755.3200000000002s)]
*  And maybe we've got to figure out some way that he takes a step back [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1758.0800000000002s)]
*  because he's been too involved with Tesla. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1760.68s)]
*  And again, if I was the Tesla shareholder, not necessarily happy. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1762.24s)]
*  The thing is, with Elon, though, is that he has a lot of other businesses. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1765.4s)]
*  For Twitter, this has been really good that he's gotten involved [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1767.88s)]
*  more in the political side. He opened up free speech. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1770.16s)]
*  He had this whole debate about his whole platform should be open [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1772.2s)]
*  to everybody in all voices. Twitter usage and revenues is backed up, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1775.12s)]
*  I think, almost record highs right now. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1779.28s)]
*  And that business is doing incredibly well. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1781.0s)]
*  And then his other business, SpaceX, SpaceX being involved [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1783.0s)]
*  with the government, being able to rescue astronauts this past week from Boeing. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1786.52s)]
*  I think it's been a huge boon to SpaceX. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1790.9599999999998s)]
*  So it's really hard to tell with Elon Musk. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1794.04s)]
*  Elon Musk also, just being the controlling shareholder, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1795.76s)]
*  the majority owner of all these businesses, it's a little bit different. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1798.3999999999999s)]
*  I think he plays in a little bit of a different ball game than others. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1801.52s)]
*  And again, I can't think of another person that's the CEO in this entire world. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1804.2s)]
*  Four, five, six, seven different multi-billion dollar companies. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1808.28s)]
*  So it's just a little bit of a different situation. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1810.92s)]
*  But in general, I don't like it when individuals [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1813.0s)]
*  who are the heads of companies are taking politicized positions, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1816.32s)]
*  because I think that we see that what ends up happening, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1818.92s)]
*  the share price, the company declines, the sales decline, customers decline. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1821.12s)]
*  And ultimately, that's the least sustainable thing that a business can do, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1825.04s)]
*  because then they have to fire employees. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1827.56s)]
*  They have to close factories, suppliers shut down. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1829.36s)]
*  So it's best for generally for companies to stay out of politics [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1831.8400000000001s)]
*  or stay in their political lane. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1835.48s)]
*  You know, I have no idea. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1837.3600000000001s)]
*  I have no problem with if you're Elon Musk and you're running a car company, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1838.3200000000002s)]
*  opining on car emissions policies, opining on union related issues [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1841.76s)]
*  related to car factories, those things are all in your lane. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1846.16s)]
*  You know, some of the other issues that a CEO like Elon will be getting involved with. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1848.52s)]
*  If you were just the CEO of Tesla, I would have I would have issues with. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1852.16s)]
*  You know, you think about Ben, he opened this call by talking about [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1856.48s)]
*  he just wants everyone to have [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1859.4399999999998s)]
*  fair and equal opportunities. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1862.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that, you know, for most people, everybody wants people to have fair [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1864.52s)]
*  and equal opportunities. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1866.6s)]
*  But we get back and then like, what does that mean? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1867.76s)]
*  And that's the problem when companies get involved, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1870.0s)]
*  whether it's on the Israeli Palestinian side. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1871.9599999999998s)]
*  Is it fair that a bunch of innocent Israelis were [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1874.1999999999998s)]
*  captured and then murdered on October 7th? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1878.8s)]
*  Is that fair and equal? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1881.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1883.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, is it fair and equal that you have voter [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1884.12s)]
*  we had to put in voter integrity laws because it seems like there were people [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1887.44s)]
*  showing up without IDs. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1890.12s)]
*  I don't know if that's fair or equal. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1891.3999999999999s)]
*  We had unlimited immigration in this country over the past couple of years. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1893.08s)]
*  Was that fair and equal to people that all of a sudden were displaced [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1896.08s)]
*  when migrant or illegal immigrants were placed in their high schools [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1899.3999999999999s)]
*  or taking up hotel rooms in the areas? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1903.24s)]
*  Is that fair and equal? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1905.08s)]
*  I think these are debates that we as kind of equal citizens, we all tend to have. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1906.0s)]
*  But we should have that sort of democracy that we live in. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1910.0s)]
*  And for the most part, it shouldn't be companies and it shouldn't be companies. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1912.6s)]
*  The ones that are taking positions on all of these issues [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1915.68s)]
*  because it leads to declining share prices as customers. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1918.3600000000001s)]
*  They sort of fragment because they don't like necessarily politics [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1920.64s)]
*  coming with their products. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1923.3200000000002s)]
*  Right. I mean, Ben, there's a big story involving Ben and Jerry's. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1924.3600000000001s)]
*  Your chief executive, David Stever, was removed [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1927.96s)]
*  by the parent company Unilever earlier this month in a growing row [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1931.04s)]
*  over political activism. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1935.0s)]
*  It comes a month after Ben and Jerry to accuse the Unilever [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1937.0s)]
*  of demanding that it stops publicly criticising US President Donald Trump. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1940.44s)]
*  The filing said Unilever has repeatedly threatened Ben and Jerry's personnel, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1946.1200000000001s)]
*  including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever's [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1949.8000000000002s)]
*  efforts to silence the social mission. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1953.2s)]
*  I mean, pretty controversial [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1956.16s)]
*  scenario there between you and the parent company. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1958.3200000000002s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1960.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, when the company was sold to Unilever, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1963.88s)]
*  Ben and Jerry's used to be a independent publicly held company [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1967.88s)]
*  when it was sold to Unilever, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1972.52s)]
*  which was something I tried to avoid, but was not able to. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1974.68s)]
*  There was a unique governance structure that was set up [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1979.8s)]
*  whereby there was a legally empowered [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1984.2s)]
*  independent board of directors that had [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1988.72s)]
*  authority over two of the three missions of Ben and Jerry's. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1993.52s)]
*  Ben and Jerry's has a social mission. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=1998.48s)]
*  It has a product mission and it has an economic mission. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2001.1200000000001s)]
*  And the independent board of directors [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2005.0800000000002s)]
*  got the legal authority to [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2009.0800000000002s)]
*  determine the social mission of the company. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2012.24s)]
*  So what's happened now is that, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2017.0s)]
*  you know, that recently the company wanted to put up a post in favour of [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2021.24s)]
*  dismantling white supremacy. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2028.72s)]
*  They wanted to put up a post, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2031.84s)]
*  you know, agreeing with free speech and [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2036.4799999999998s)]
*  against the, you know, the arrest of, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2041.32s)]
*  you know, this guy at Columbia. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2046.12s)]
*  So that was not Unilever's authority. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2049.7999999999997s)]
*  That was not an area that Unilever legally had authority for. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2052.56s)]
*  And so the board sued them. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2057.0s)]
*  And now they are threatening to [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2059.52s)]
*  to fire the CEO of the company, Dave Steaver, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2064.96s)]
*  a guy who started as a tour guide 35 or 40 years ago and has risen up the ranks [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2069.36s)]
*  to be an incredible CEO of the company. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2076.0s)]
*  Has it given you any pause for thought that this political activism stance [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2080.4s)]
*  that Ben and Jerry's takes, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2083.88s)]
*  particularly if you have a parent company that doesn't agree with it? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2085.6800000000003s)]
*  Becomes a sort of act of self harm? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2089.08s)]
*  It's definitely a problem when you have a parent company that doesn't agree with it. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2093.72s)]
*  You know, Ben and Jerry's has been owned by Unilever since the year 2000. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2097.24s)]
*  And pretty much up until, you know, two or three years ago, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2103.96s)]
*  things were going pretty well. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2108.96s)]
*  But there has been a change in management at Unilever. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2111.4s)]
*  And there's a lot of conflict right now. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2116.96s)]
*  In 2018, Ben and Jerry's said it was taking a stand against Trump [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2121.2s)]
*  by rebranding one of its flavours under the name Pecan Resist. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2126.32s)]
*  Can we look forward to more resisting ice cream varieties now, second time round? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2130.4s)]
*  You never know. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2138.36s)]
*  Would you be happy with Ben and Jerry's actually coming out with a variety of ice cream [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2140.08s)]
*  which directly attacked Trump, given the emphatic nature of his win? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2146.0s)]
*  I think that Ben and Jerry's should be taking stands on issues. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2150.52s)]
*  I'm not looking to attack particular people myself. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2157.56s)]
*  I mean, Trump, for example, Ben and Jerry's dropped a video [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2162.1600000000003s)]
*  announcing that it would never stop fighting for our democracy. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2166.6800000000003s)]
*  This is when Trump returned to the White House. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2170.6400000000003s)]
*  Unilever does a lot of business with Russia, with China. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2173.68s)]
*  Have you made your feelings clear to them that you resent them [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2177.9199999999996s)]
*  doing business with democracy loathing countries like Russia and China? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2182.72s)]
*  Or does it only apply to America's president? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2187.64s)]
*  Personally, I have no problem with doing business with [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2191.6s)]
*  Russia, China. Really? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2196.72s)]
*  Yeah. So why do you have a problem with Trump and democracy? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2200.3999999999996s)]
*  Why are you releasing through Ben and Jerry's videos [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2203.36s)]
*  saying you'll never stop fighting for democracy? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2207.7200000000003s)]
*  I think there was a bunch of undemocratic actions that [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2209.2000000000003s)]
*  Trump was taking in this country. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2213.84s)]
*  Why not? Just to be clear, you have a problem with actions [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2216.6s)]
*  that may damage democracy in the United States. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2221.28s)]
*  You have absolutely no problem doing business with Russia and China. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2223.76s)]
*  I don't believe that every country in the world needs to be a democracy. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2227.44s)]
*  And actually, I don't really believe that the US is a democracy in practice. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2231.68s)]
*  Right. But why do you care, sir? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2236.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's supposed to be one person, one vote, but it's one dollar, one vote. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2238.56s)]
*  I mean, billionaires and corporations control our legislation [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2242.96s)]
*  through lobbying. They control who gets elected through political donations. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2248.24s)]
*  Would you be happy to represent the money? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2254.48s)]
*  Would you be happy to do business with North Korea? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2258.2s)]
*  I believe that we need to get along with nations around the world. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2262.68s)]
*  I don't believe that every nation has to have the same form of government. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2268.72s)]
*  No, I don't believe that it makes sense to for anybody to to to what? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2273.16s)]
*  Ostracize other nations and and and have wars with them or would you [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2281.7599999999998s)]

*  Disney's remake of Snow White has become one of the most preemptively [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2361.6s)]
*  hated movies in the history of Hollywood. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2364.6800000000003s)]
*  It's finding out this week after a disaster strewn two year buildup. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2367.12s)]
*  The downfall began in 2023 when star Rachel Ziegler heralded as the [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2370.48s)]
*  boundary breaking first ever Latina Snow White condemned the beloved [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2375.8399999999997s)]
*  fairy tale as creepy, predatory and sexist. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2380.08s)]
*  It then emerged that Disney had axed the seven dwarves, apparently to [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2382.3999999999996s)]
*  avoid typecasting and defending actual doors. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2386.44s)]
*  This all came as a nasty shock for dwarf actors who already compete [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2389.92s)]
*  for a very limited number of lucrative roles. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2393.96s)]
*  They were these cave dwelling monsters that people speak of. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2396.52s)]
*  They all had seven different characteristics for seven different [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2401.52s)]
*  actors from my community. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2405.52s)]
*  I don't feel it's right that they got taken away from us. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2407.52s)]
*  I completely and utterly agree with you. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2411.52s)]
*  And the irony is that they profess these progressives to want to do [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2413.52s)]
*  this to protect you. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2417.52s)]
*  Well, I'm dying to say this, but I'm not going to lie. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2419.52s)]
*  They want to protect you. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2423.52s)]
*  I'm dying to say that Dylan will be rejoining us shortly to give an [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2425.52s)]
*  update, but I'm afraid it's not a happy ever after scenario. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2428.52s)]
*  The seven dwarves were first replaced by seven diverse magical [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2431.52s)]
*  creatures, whatever that means. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2435.52s)]
*  And a fury mounted, Disney did decide to bring the dwarves back. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2437.52s)]
*  So the dwarf actors, human actors, they used cheap CGI dwarves that [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2441.52s)]
*  looked like garden gnomes. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2445.52s)]
*  It was a budget of $270 million and one of the most popular stories in [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2447.52s)]
*  history. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2451.52s)]
*  How did it all go so badly wrong? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2452.52s)]
*  We're joined to explain all this, uncensored contributor Esther Krague, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2454.52s)]
*  Gary Buchla, aka Nedrotic, the critical drinker, Will Jordan, and [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2458.52s)]
*  author of the case for Council Culture, Ernest Oed. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2462.52s)]
*  Welcome to all of you. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2466.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2468.52s)]
*  Let me start with you, Nedrotic, on this. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2469.52s)]
*  Where did it all go so catastrophically wrong? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2472.52s)]
*  Was it Rachel Ziegler, appointing one of the wokest actresses in [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2475.52s)]
*  the world, who was the catalyst for all this? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2479.52s)]
*  Or was it Virtue Sittling gone mad? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2482.52s)]
*  What did you put your finger on? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2484.52s)]
*  I think it was. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2486.52s)]
*  I mean, we can start out with the creative bankruptcy of remaking [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2488.52s)]
*  another animated classic instead of making something new. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2492.52s)]
*  But yes, it's all Rachel, Rachel Ziegler and her behavior. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2495.52s)]
*  And if it was just one comment, it probably would have been forgotten [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2499.52s)]
*  by now. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2503.52s)]
*  But it was comment after comment and it was pissing off everybody, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2504.52s)]
*  Disney fans, pissing off new Disney fans, pissing off Trump supporters, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2508.52s)]
*  pissing off all of America. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2512.52s)]
*  And it became such a disaster that they had to shut her up, which was [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2514.52s)]
*  the smartest move they made. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2518.52s)]
*  But the onus is all on her and Disney's reaction to it. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2520.52s)]
*  And quite frankly, if she has said nothing, her movie, probably still [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2523.52s)]
*  forgettable, would have done a lot better. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2527.52s)]
*  Critical drinker, I mean, it's even down to the fact that Rachel Ziegler [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2530.52s)]
*  and... [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2533.52s)]
*  Is it Ziegler or Ziegler, by the way? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2534.52s)]
*  Ziegler, I think is how you pronounce it. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2536.52s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2538.52s)]
*  Let's just clarify that. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2539.52s)]
*  The battle between her and Gal Gadot is that they take diametrically [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2541.52s)]
*  different views even on things like the Israel-Hamas war. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2547.52s)]
*  Ziegler publicly supporting Palestine, Gal Gadot served in the IDF [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2550.52s)]
*  and wrote, I stand with Israel, you should too, the world can't stand [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2555.52s)]
*  on the fence, so on. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2558.52s)]
*  So here are the two stars of the movie, even diametrically opposed in a [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2559.52s)]
*  very polarising manner over a big war that's raging. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2563.52s)]
*  Sure, it feels like every aspect of this movie just seems to breed [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2567.52s)]
*  controversy and yet that's just another aspect of it. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2570.52s)]
*  By all accounts, they do not get on particularly well. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2573.52s)]
*  I think you could tell that from their body language when they were [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2576.52s)]
*  presenting an Oscar together. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2578.52s)]
*  They just could not have disliked each other more. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2580.52s)]
*  So, yeah, it's just another nail in the coffin of this movie, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2583.52s)]
*  unfortunately. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2585.52s)]
*  Ernest, you've seen it. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2586.52s)]
*  So what do you think? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2587.52s)]
*  Don't tell me you loved it. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2588.52s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2590.52s)]
*  It was incredible. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2591.52s)]
*  Of course. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2592.52s)]
*  I think that Rachel, well, you could say of course, but you haven't [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2593.52s)]
*  seen it, so you might agree with me. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2597.52s)]
*  I've read some of the previews of people who have. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2599.52s)]
*  She's incredible. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2601.52s)]
*  She's vocally... [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2602.52s)]
*  Killing it. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2603.52s)]
*  She's vocally talented. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2604.52s)]
*  She's crushing it. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2605.52s)]
*  A lot of people saw her first previews and movie critics are already [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2606.52s)]
*  saying great things about her performance. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2609.52s)]
*  She's whimsical, she's funny, she's light-hearted, and it's a great film. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2611.52s)]
*  And I also think Gal Gadot plays the evil witch very, very well. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2615.52s)]
*  And so I think they both were perfectly cast for the film, and I [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2619.52s)]
*  think that it's going to be a great film that's going to get over [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2622.52s)]
*  $100 million in the global box office. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2625.52s)]
*  Which is great, because they're going to hate the movie. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2627.52s)]
*  Hang on, they spent nearly $300 million, so that would be a [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2630.52s)]
*  catastrophic failure. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2633.52s)]
*  You realize that, Ernest? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2634.52s)]
*  Actually, $350 million. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2635.52s)]
*  $350 million. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2637.52s)]
*  So, Ernest, you think it would be a success if it grossed $100 million, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2638.52s)]
*  having cost $350 million to make. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2642.52s)]
*  Is that your position? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2645.52s)]
*  I'm talking about opening weekend. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2646.52s)]
*  We saw this with the Lion King remake. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2648.52s)]
*  Everybody was acting like it was going to flop, but I think it's going [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2650.52s)]
*  to be a slow burner. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2653.52s)]
*  I think it's going to do the same thing that the Lion King did. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2654.52s)]
*  Not equally, but I do think there's going to be a buildup. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2657.52s)]
*  And I think that the performances speak for themselves. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2659.52s)]
*  Esther? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2662.52s)]
*  In as much as Rachel Zegler tap dances on my last good nerve, she is [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2663.52s)]
*  a talented singer. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2666.52s)]
*  However, that was not what this film was about. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2667.52s)]
*  There are many talented singers in Hollywood. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2669.52s)]
*  Snow White shouldn't have been the shade of Snow Latte, first of all. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2671.52s)]
*  I think the casting was probably the biggest thing. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2674.52s)]
*  Barring the fact that even if she had kept her mouth shut, which she [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2676.52s)]
*  should have, because there was a lot of money riding on this, the [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2679.52s)]
*  casting was as well. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2682.52s)]
*  I love Gal Gadot, but she's not a very emotive actress. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2683.52s)]
*  And I don't think... [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2685.52s)]
*  There are limits to how far I can stretch my imagination to believe [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2686.52s)]
*  that someone who looks like Gal Gadot would be jealous of the [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2689.52s)]
*  appearance of someone like Rachel Zegler. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2692.52s)]
*  But isn't the problem that every time... [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2694.52s)]
*  You say it's not about whether she opened her mouth or not. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2696.52s)]
*  Isn't the problem that literally every time she opened her little [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2699.52s)]
*  woke mouth, all hell broke loose? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2702.52s)]
*  She called the Prince basically a stalker. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2704.52s)]
*  She then hammered Israel. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2707.52s)]
*  She then told Trump supporters she didn't need their business. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2709.52s)]
*  Imagine being a Disney executive and you hear the star of your new [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2712.52s)]
*  Snow White remake alienating more than half the country. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2716.52s)]
*  The Republicans just won a big win. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2720.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2722.52s)]
*  Alienated them all in one fell swoop. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2723.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2725.52s)]
*  The smartest thing they did, as Gary said, was to try and chore her [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2726.52s)]
*  and just kill her. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2729.52s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2730.52s)]
*  Critical drinkers talking. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2731.52s)]
*  Yeah, the smartest thing, as Gary said, that Disney could have done [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2733.52s)]
*  was to bury her and just keep her from talking to anyone. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2736.52s)]
*  Do not give her a hot mic and do not let her spout her stupid, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2739.52s)]
*  uninformed opinions. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2742.52s)]
*  She's a kid. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2743.52s)]
*  She's a dumb, uninformed kid who's never done a day's work in her [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2744.52s)]
*  entire life. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2747.52s)]
*  And of course she has an opinion on everything. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2748.52s)]
*  That doesn't mean we have to view her now. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2750.52s)]
*  It's not about being a woman. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2752.52s)]
*  She couldn't point to Israel on a map. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2753.52s)]
*  The fact that someone like Gal Gadot, who's actually had a career, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2755.52s)]
*  or someone like Richard Munchkin, someone who actually has a career, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2758.52s)]
*  who I'm pretty sure the hardest role in her life was pretending to be [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2761.52s)]
*  jealous of the looks of Rachel Ziegler. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2764.52s)]
*  And this is not to take away from the fact that she is a talented singer. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2766.52s)]
*  Who hasn't gone in love, though? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2769.52s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2770.52s)]
*  Rachel Ziegler is very talented. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2771.52s)]
*  By the way, she's not even white, is she? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2772.52s)]
*  I'm not even going to get into that. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2774.52s)]
*  We know she's Snow Latte. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2776.52s)]
*  The original description of Snow White's skin in the book is as [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2777.52s)]
*  white as snow. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2780.52s)]
*  Lips as red as blood, hair as black as... [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2781.52s)]
*  It couldn't be clearer. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2783.52s)]
*  They missed the mark there. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2784.52s)]
*  They should have passed it to me. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2785.52s)]
*  Is it true that she wasn't as white as snow? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2787.52s)]
*  A fairy tale. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2792.52s)]
*  Well, people have eyes. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2793.52s)]
*  Let's put an aedrotic. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2795.52s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2797.52s)]
*  Apologies, Piers. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2798.52s)]
*  I think it does matter because if you want to remake a Disney... [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2800.52s)]
*  I mean, there are tens of... [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2804.52s)]
*  10, 20, 30, 40, 50 remakes of Snow White or adaptions of the story. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2807.52s)]
*  But if you're remaking the Disney classic that started the company, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2812.52s)]
*  I would think you wanted to make it as close as possible to the [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2816.52s)]
*  original, including the dwarves and including the main character, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2820.52s)]
*  Snow White. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2824.52s)]
*  Well, we're going to come to the dwarf part, which is just beyond [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2825.52s)]
*  parody, to be honest with you. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2828.52s)]
*  But, Ernest, the British Board of Film Classification has put trigger [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2830.52s)]
*  warnings on here to say a woman is deliberately poisoned and a girl is [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2834.52s)]
*  surrounded by ominous trees. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2838.52s)]
*  Can I ask you, I've never understood who these trigger warnings are [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2840.52s)]
*  aimed at. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2844.52s)]
*  Who could be that pathetically spineless and lily-livered and weak [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2845.52s)]
*  and snowflakey that they need to be warned that in an animated movie [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2849.52s)]
*  they're going to have... [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2854.52s)]
*  Well, it's not fully animated, isn't it? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2856.52s)]
*  In this, you might get things which might be a little unsettling. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2859.52s)]
*  Are you the guy that they're doing this for? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2863.52s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2867.52s)]
*  I mean, I don't live in Britain, but I do think it's interesting that [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2868.52s)]
*  there's a lot of critique around censorship. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2872.52s)]
*  You all are supposed to be the bastions of free speech and expressions, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2875.52s)]
*  and you all are turning over snowflakes because Rachel Ziegler said a [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2879.52s)]
*  couple of different things that don't ruffle your feathers politically. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2882.52s)]
*  I think you all are the council culture crew. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2885.52s)]
*  Maybe you all should be co-authors of my book since you all seem to [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2887.52s)]
*  agree about how problematic and how issue and hominist... [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2891.52s)]
*  I have no problem with Rachel Ziegler starting off. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2894.52s)]
*  If she was a Trumper, you would agree. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2897.52s)]
*  Listen, I've got no problem with her spouting off. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2899.52s)]
*  You would agree. If she was a Trumper, you wouldn't be having this conversation. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2901.52s)]
*  I respect her right to spout any nonsense she likes. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2904.52s)]
*  It doesn't mean to say that we can't criticise her for it. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2906.52s)]
*  She can say it. Of course she can. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2909.52s)]
*  No, but you said she should be silenced. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2911.52s)]
*  She shouldn't be silenced. There's $350 million on the line. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2913.52s)]
*  I said if you're Disney... [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2915.52s)]
*  If you're Disney, Ernest, you want her to shut up and stop trashing the movie. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2917.52s)]
*  She shouldn't have taken the role if she was going to jeopardise $350 million. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2922.52s)]
*  Hang on. Pretty good drinking. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2926.52s)]
*  Can we look at this from a business perspective? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2928.52s)]
*  Ultimately, Rachel Ziegler is there as a representative of the Disney company. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2930.52s)]
*  She's there to sell a product. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2934.52s)]
*  In this case, the product is Snow White the movie. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2936.52s)]
*  The best way to sell a product is to appeal to as many people as possible. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2938.52s)]
*  If you straight up say that 50% of your audience can get fucked, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2941.52s)]
*  then you're not really appealing to a wide audience, are you? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2945.52s)]
*  It's just bad business. Let's bring in someone who has seen it. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2948.52s)]
*  But you're proving my point, though. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2951.52s)]
*  Hang on. No. There's a double standard. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2953.52s)]
*  There's no double standard. Everyone should keep their mouth shut. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2955.52s)]
*  Everyone should keep their mouth shut. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2957.52s)]
*  Snow White should be beautiful. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2959.52s)]
*  Hold on. No, no, no. Everyone should keep their mouth shut. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2961.52s)]
*  Snow White should be beautiful. She should turn up on set. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2963.52s)]
*  Her skin should be white as snow, and she shouldn't... [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2966.52s)]
*  What's next? A bald Rapunzel. It's not hard to do this properly. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2968.52s)]
*  A beautiful singing actress who keeps her mouth shut [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2971.52s)]
*  unless she's talking about the film and how great it is [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2974.52s)]
*  so she doesn't tank $350 million. It's not hard. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2976.52s)]
*  It's not hard. You don't believe what you're saying. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2979.52s)]
*  Hang on. Let's bring in someone. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2981.52s)]
*  I want to bring in someone who's seen the film. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2982.52s)]
*  This is a publisher of Film Threat, Chris Gore. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2984.52s)]
*  Chris, you've seen the film. Is it any good? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2986.52s)]
*  Yes, I have. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2988.52s)]
*  Well, I'll have to give it up to Rachel Zegler. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2990.52s)]
*  She has quite a singing voice. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2993.52s)]
*  She's actually very good, and it's a solid 3 out of 10. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=2995.52s)]
*  On every level, every other level, you can judge the film. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3000.52s)]
*  It is a colossal disaster. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3004.52s)]
*  From the over-bloated exposition to the dwarves, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3007.52s)]
*  the dwarves are an ungodly nightmare. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3013.52s)]
*  Why they did it in CG, I do not know. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3017.52s)]
*  They put seven little people out of work for this. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3020.52s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3023.52s)]
*  They are horribly animated. Horribly. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3025.52s)]
*  I think it might scare young children, but really, in the end, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3028.52s)]
*  it's just it was ill. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3033.52s)]
*  It was a bad decision even to make this. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3036.52s)]
*  And it's not as woke as it could have been, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3039.52s)]
*  but there is messaging underneath. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3043.52s)]
*  They might as well have said the words equity, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3046.52s)]
*  because they went right up to that line and didn't say it, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3048.52s)]
*  but it's terrible and torturous. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3051.52s)]
*  I can't imagine kids are going to love it, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3054.52s)]
*  but wow, they really had an opportunity and failed. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3057.52s)]
*  I mean, it's going to be interesting how it does at the box office, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3061.52s)]
*  because they spent so much money on this that the pre-publicity has been so awful [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3064.52s)]
*  that if it gets off to a very poor start, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3068.52s)]
*  you can see this becoming a real turkey. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3071.52s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3074.52s)]
*  I really think that the advance ticket sales are in the gutter. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3076.52s)]
*  They're trash. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3081.52s)]
*  People are posting screenshots of empty theaters, but this is not a movie. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3082.52s)]
*  This is a movie where families will decide to see a movie, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3088.52s)]
*  not buy advance tickets and walk up. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3092.52s)]
*  So it could go either way. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3094.52s)]
*  I think in the end, because of the budget, it's a financial disaster. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3096.52s)]
*  And it just shows how creatively bankrupt Disney is as a studio, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3100.52s)]
*  that they're even considering doing this. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3107.52s)]
*  These live action remakes have all been awful, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3110.52s)]
*  and this one has been burdened by, of course, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3114.52s)]
*  Ziegler and her being very outspoken politically, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3118.52s)]
*  probably a bad choice. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3122.52s)]
*  They didn't rein her in soon enough. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3124.52s)]
*  I don't think she understood the responsibility of taking on this role. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3126.52s)]
*  So where her career is after this, I think Broadway, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3130.52s)]
*  but she will never be an actress that will be at the head of a tent pole, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3134.52s)]
*  big blockbuster. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3139.52s)]
*  No one will take a risk on her, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3140.52s)]
*  and this movie will prove that out. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3142.52s)]
*  Chris Gaw, thank you very much. I appreciate you joining us. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3145.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3148.52s)]
*  Well, let's get into this other aspect of it, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3150.52s)]
*  which was the ludicrous decision to not actually use dwarf actors [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3154.52s)]
*  to play Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3159.52s)]
*  And Critical Drinker, my whole position on this, from the start, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3161.52s)]
*  has been in the dwarf actor world, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3165.52s)]
*  there is not a bigger gig or a more lucrative, better-paid gig [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3169.52s)]
*  out there in Hollywood than playing one of the dwarfs [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3174.52s)]
*  in a Disney remake of Snow White. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3178.52s)]
*  And yet, in an effort to supposedly be more inclusive [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3180.52s)]
*  and to signal their virtue for what they saw as a marginalised group [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3185.52s)]
*  of people in society, they completely screwed them over, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3189.52s)]
*  and they deprived seven dwarf actors of great jobs. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3192.52s)]
*  They then tried these mystical beast nonsense, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3197.52s)]
*  then they abandoned that, and they brought in CGI versions of dwarfs, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3200.52s)]
*  which apparently look and sound absurd in the film. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3206.52s)]
*  What is going on here? What's the mindset behind this? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3210.52s)]
*  I think you're giving them too much credit by implying [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3213.52s)]
*  that there is a mindset behind it. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3216.52s)]
*  This is where ideology ends up tying itself in knots [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3218.52s)]
*  to the point where you've got a Snow White who isn't white, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3221.52s)]
*  you've got a search for true love that doesn't have true love in it, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3224.52s)]
*  because that's problematic, and you've now got the seven dwarfs [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3227.52s)]
*  who aren't dwarfs, but now are dwarfs again, but they're CGI dwarfs, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3230.52s)]
*  because we don't want to employ real dwarf actors. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3234.52s)]
*  It's absurd. It's the complete absurdity of modern Hollywood. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3237.52s)]
*  They are so desperate not to offend anyone that they end up screwing up [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3240.52s)]
*  everything that they do. They were fired for their own good. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3244.52s)]
*  Disney are facing a big protest and backlash from dwarf actors and actresses [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3247.52s)]
*  over the decision to replace Snow White's seven dwarfs with CGI characters. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3251.52s)]
*  Returning to Uncensored is Dylan Possell, aka Hornswoggle from WWE. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3255.52s)]
*  Dylan, great to see you again. What a mess Disney made of this. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3260.52s)]
*  But just on that point, we discussed this before, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3265.52s)]
*  but what I really resent is that dwarf actors have been deprived [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3268.52s)]
*  of potentially one of the best gigs of their entire careers. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3274.52s)]
*  You know, Pierce, you mentioned the seven actors, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3278.52s)]
*  but what about the stunt doubles and the stand-ins and all of that? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3281.52s)]
*  Now you're talking 12 to 15 at least people in the acting industry [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3285.52s)]
*  from my community that got left out of jobs. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3291.52s)]
*  And here's the thing. To me, it wasn't Disney's call, sure, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3295.52s)]
*  but this all fell back on what Peter Dinklage said on that show. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3301.52s)]
*  This all fell back on what Peter Dinklage said on that podcast [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3305.52s)]
*  about what is he on his soapbox about for all of these years [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3309.52s)]
*  and him literally making that statement and canceling this whole community of their jobs. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3312.52s)]
*  And what makes him the voice of my and our dwarf acting community [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3321.52s)]
*  and little people community? Why is it him that speaks up for all of us? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3327.52s)]
*  Why was on television for 10 plus years? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3333.52s)]
*  Why is he being taken as the voice of the whole community? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3336.52s)]
*  That's my issue. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3340.52s)]
*  What has been the... [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3342.52s)]
*  I would have... [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3344.52s)]
*  Has he faced a big backlash now? Because I completely agree with you. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3345.52s)]
*  Who appointed him, the great high priest of society, what work goes to who? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3348.52s)]
*  From me he sure has. I can't speak for the others. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3354.52s)]
*  But for me, sure has, because again, what makes it okay? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3358.52s)]
*  Producers, directors, I would love these roles. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3362.52s)]
*  I would love all of these roles. I would love any roles. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3368.52s)]
*  Whether they're written for a dwarf actor or whether they're written for another actor, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3371.52s)]
*  any role is okay for anyone. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3376.52s)]
*  That's the thing of where I'm coming from. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3378.52s)]
*  Me going out for a role doesn't necessarily have to be a dwarf casted role, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3381.52s)]
*  but these were. These were dream roles. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3388.52s)]
*  Seven dream roles in a major production. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3391.52s)]
*  A major production. Disney never does anything small as we know. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3395.52s)]
*  Disney does big things. This is a dream role for people of my community. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3399.52s)]
*  Of course it is. And the other thing, I just thought that the secondary phase, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3403.52s)]
*  when they brought in these magical creatures, which were all of varying heights, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3408.52s)]
*  some were very tall, right? I mean, I don't know how that made you feel, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3412.52s)]
*  but I just thought it was absurd. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3416.52s)]
*  I mean, I just think it was, I think it was trying to fix an immediate voice [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3421.52s)]
*  and fix that issue, who knows? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3429.52s)]
*  But again, I go back to why is it one voice that matters? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3432.52s)]
*  Why is it, why aren't we taking other people in the community? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3435.52s)]
*  And this doesn't just go for my community. It goes for any community. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3438.52s)]
*  Why aren't we taking other voices into consideration? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3441.52s)]
*  I heard that the dwarf actors were not even asked to voice the CGI characters. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3444.52s)]
*  They didn't even get voiceover action here, which again... [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3449.52s)]
*  I have no idea about that, but who knows? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3453.52s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous to me. And here's the thing. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3456.52s)]
*  Someone said about how it's not original or their creativity is out the window. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3461.52s)]
*  I don't feel that way. I love these remakes. I'm a Disney fanatic. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3468.52s)]
*  I'm a Disney adult, as they say. These remakes, these live-action remakes, I love them. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3471.52s)]
*  But the issue is Snow White is what kicked off the Walt Disney film franchise and company. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3476.52s)]
*  So now, argue with me if you want, who was the star of Snow White? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3484.52s)]
*  Was it Snow White or who were the dwarves stand out the most? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3489.52s)]
*  The dwarves. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3493.52s)]
*  The dwarves are what you remember about the film. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3494.52s)]
*  Seven different characters with different personalities who now could have been seven different actors [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3497.52s)]
*  with different personalities and different dream roles. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3504.52s)]
*  And you know what's really laughable in a sick way is if you asked Disney at the time why they were doing this, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3507.52s)]
*  and so we're being progressive. We're listening. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3514.52s)]
*  We feel it's, you know, they're listening to people like Peter Dinklage. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3517.52s)]
*  No, no, they're listening to one. They're listening to one. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3523.52s)]
*  Right, that's my point. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3526.52s)]
*  People is multiple. That's my issue. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3527.52s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3530.52s)]
*  They're listening to one voice. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3531.52s)]
*  Right, I agree, but what they're doing, they're making it... [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3532.52s)]
*  And that person to me, he's not... I never voted him as president of my community. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3534.52s)]
*  Right! [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3539.52s)]
*  I never voted that. He's the one that spoke up because he had that voice on that podcast. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3540.52s)]
*  I get it. I really, really do. He had a huge platform and he said that on a platform and it just got buzzed. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3545.52s)]
*  I understand that. But then why not after that go to other dwarf actors? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3552.52s)]
*  Or even not even dwarf actors, just people in the dwarf community. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3557.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3560.52s)]
*  And be like, hey, you take this offensively? No. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3561.52s)]
*  I would bet, I would bet my house that, yes, ten people, nine in the dwarf community are going, no, that's great for our community. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3564.52s)]
*  100%. I think Peter Dinklage owes you all a massive public apology. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3574.52s)]
*  And it's fine for him because he's made his millions. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3580.52s)]
*  He won't do it. The issue is he won't do it. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3583.52s)]
*  The check from Elf, when he took that role, cashed perfectly fine. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3586.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3591.52s)]
*  Cashed perfectly fine. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3592.52s)]
*  Exactly. Fine for him, not fine for everybody else. It's brilliant to talk to you, Dylan. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3593.52s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3599.52s)]
*  You've been such a great advocate on this. Honestly, every word you say about it just rings so true. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3600.52s)]
*  And again, this isn't about me personally. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3605.52s)]
*  No, I know. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3608.52s)]
*  This isn't about the dwarf acting community. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3609.52s)]
*  I mean, can I just say- [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3610.52s)]
*  And even above that, go ahead. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3611.52s)]
*  No, I don't mean to trivialize this, but this kind of reminds me of what was done to ring girls who were basically fired for their own good. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3615.52s)]
*  So I'm not a huge boxing fan, but I went to see a boxing match in London. Not of my own volition. I was on a date. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3621.52s)]
*  And I was like, this is great. I get to see some boxing and I get to see some cheeks as well. This is fun. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3626.52s)]
*  And there was no cheeks. It was just bloody boxing. And then I asked one of the staff there, where are the ring girls? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3631.52s)]
*  I came here. This is part of the reason why I came. And they were like, no, no, no. They were fired because of equality. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3636.52s)]
*  And I feel like this is kind of a similar thing. Something has happened on behalf of the community without actually the community's- [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3641.52s)]
*  Nobody asked the ring girls if they were fired. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3647.52s)]
*  It looks great to me. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3649.52s)]
*  I feel this is completely different, ma'am. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3651.52s)]
*  Really? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3653.52s)]
*  This is absolutely, completely different. Absolutely, completely different. I'm in the sports entertainment world. I can't take your side on that. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3654.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3661.52s)]
*  So this is literally people just going out for these roles that were made for them. And now they're taken away because one voice. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3662.52s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree with you. Dylan, great to see you. Thank you very much. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3671.52s)]
*  It's nice to see that you're an advocate for DEI, Pierce. I'm happy to see that. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3675.52s)]
*  What's that? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3680.52s)]
*  I'm saying I'm happy to see that you're an advocate for DEI. It's refreshing. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3681.52s)]
*  In what sense? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3685.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, it's interesting because so much of the show in the past and just these narratives lately have been about cutting jobs and being efficient. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3686.52s)]
*  And you're advocating for Disney to do more inclusive work. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3697.52s)]
*  No, I think you're missing the point. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3701.52s)]
*  I agree with you. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3702.52s)]
*  You're missing the point. When the movie is called... [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3703.52s)]
*  I think I do. I agree with you. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3705.52s)]
*  No, no. It's not DEI to think that dwarfs should play dwarfs. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3707.52s)]
*  No, it's authenticity. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3710.52s)]
*  I think dwarf actors should have been in the film. I agree with you on that. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3712.52s)]
*  It's authenticity. It has nothing to do with DEI. DEI has nothing to do with it whatsoever. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3714.52s)]
*  No, but it is though. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3717.52s)]
*  Ironically, what is... Okay, if it's DEI, what is inclusive about excluding dwarf actors from the roles? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3718.52s)]
*  No, I'm saying. I mean, I agree with you. I think that there should have been dwarf representation. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3727.52s)]
*  Yeah, but you don't think that a white woman should have played Snow White, which is interesting. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3732.52s)]
*  You know, Pierce, we've had this conversation for a while about historical films. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3735.52s)]
*  Hang on, hang on. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3739.52s)]
*  And you said, could you play Nelson Mandela as a white guy? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3740.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3743.52s)]
*  And I told you, I don't think so. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3744.52s)]
*  No. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3745.52s)]
*  And you were very much like, well, you thought it was important about the accuracy about that. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3746.52s)]
*  And now you're saying a fictional character like Snow White, I guess, can't be played by a Latino woman because a fairy tale narrative, I guess, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3749.52s)]
*  Brandy shouldn't have played Cinderella because Cinderella was white, I guess. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3757.52s)]
*  Because Snow White had skin white as snow. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3760.52s)]
*  Hold on. No, I'm sorry. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3762.52s)]
*  I don't understand the limits of your advocacy. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3764.52s)]
*  Snow White was called Snow White because her skin was as white as snow. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3766.52s)]
*  I don't understand the logic of having a beige lady play Snow White when there are perfectly available white actresses that could play that. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3770.52s)]
*  Just like Ryan Gosling isn't playing Mbaka or something from Black Panther. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3778.52s)]
*  Like, where are the limits of your advocacy? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3784.52s)]
*  So it's okay for one race but not another. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3786.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think the whole point is they are dwarves in the movie and dwarf actors were deprived of playing them. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3788.52s)]
*  That's not a DEI issue. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3793.52s)]
*  It's just an authenticity outrage. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3795.52s)]
*  I want to end on something which we may all agree with, even you, Ernest, which is are Hilaria and Alec Baldwin the most annoying people on God's Earth? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3798.52s)]
*  But do we now have a scintilla of sympathy for Alec Baldwin after we saw this clip of them on a red carpet talking about their God-awful reality show? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3811.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3821.52s)]
*  I think we're going to see, you know. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3823.52s)]
*  We're going to see how it feels to have it be out there. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3825.52s)]
*  It's going to be great. You're a winner. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3827.52s)]
*  Oh my God, when I'm talking, you're not talking. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3829.52s)]
*  No, when I'm talking, you're not talking. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3831.52s)]
*  This is why, yes, we'll have to just cut him out of the show. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3833.52s)]
*  No, I mean, I think this is a really raw show and it's very real and we took a lot of chances. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3836.52s)]
*  And, you know, I think that it's, we'll see where it leads us. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3846.52s)]
*  We'll see what it feels like to have the out there and then we'll see, you know, if people like it. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3850.52s)]
*  Oh my God, I'm talking and not talking. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3856.52s)]
*  Not talking! [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3858.52s)]
*  It's that fake Spanish accent as well. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3859.52s)]
*  Well, let me start with you, Ernest, on this. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3861.52s)]
*  Come on. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3863.52s)]
*  I mean, she's a horror story. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3864.52s)]
*  Any woman that does that to her husband on a red carpet. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3866.52s)]
*  Talking, not talking! [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3869.52s)]
*  I mean, it's unbelievable. What was going on? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3871.52s)]
*  What does she do in private? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3873.52s)]
*  Yeah, to be a fly on the wall in their house after that. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3875.52s)]
*  Well, literally, they are a fly on the wall, aren't they? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3878.52s)]
*  But Ernest? [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3880.52s)]
*  But yeah, they're on a reality show and they're doing what they do best. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3882.52s)]
*  And I think in many ways, celebrity culture in that regard, it's cringy. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3886.52s)]
*  It's cringy and this has nothing to do with their political stances because they're a hot mess on that front. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3893.52s)]
*  But I would honestly say that, you know, when you think about it, I mean, this is what happens when you have a camera on you for 24-7. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3898.52s)]
*  It's not good for anyone. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3905.52s)]
*  Yeah, but actually, Esther, what it showed was a real glimpse into that marriage. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3907.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3910.52s)]
*  I've always felt a little bit of sympathy for her having to be married to an idiot like Alec Baldwin. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3911.52s)]
*  But actually, watching that clip, it looks like he's in some sort of misery remake. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3916.52s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, a few months ago, we were talking about whether he deserves... [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3921.52s)]
*  They're meant for each other. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3923.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, we were talking about whether he deserves to go to prison a few months ago. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3924.52s)]
*  I think this is a fate worse than prison. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3927.52s)]
*  He has like 20 kids with this woman. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3929.52s)]
*  You know... [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3931.52s)]
*  You're talking about guilty for a crime. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3933.52s)]
*  18 years. 18 years. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3935.52s)]
*  He's incarcerated with hilarious. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3937.52s)]
*  It is hilarious, isn't it, Nedrotic? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3939.52s)]
*  It's absolutely hilarious and I don't have any sympathy for Alec Baldwin whatsoever. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3942.52s)]
*  I think the universe tends to unfold as it should. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3947.52s)]
*  Karma is a bitch, baby. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3950.52s)]
*  Good luck. Yes, it is. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3952.52s)]
*  He's got the living prison sentence everyone else thinks you should actually have. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3954.52s)]
*  Critical drinker. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3958.52s)]
*  You know what I was really surprised about? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3960.52s)]
*  I mean, on their actual reality show, there's a load more of this stuff in it. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3962.52s)]
*  It's unwatchable, Tosh, really. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3966.52s)]
*  But also, once again, Alec Baldwin portraying himself as the kind of victim [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3968.52s)]
*  of the whole shooting incident on that set when, in fact, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3973.52s)]
*  a beautiful young woman was shot dead by Alec Baldwin. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3977.52s)]
*  Now, I don't believe he did it deliberately, obviously, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3981.52s)]
*  but he had the gun in his hand, the fire that killed this woman, right? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3985.52s)]
*  And the idea you then do a whole reality show for personal gain, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3989.52s)]
*  millions of dollars, in which a lot of it is there, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3993.52s)]
*  how's he doing with it all after the shooting? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=3997.52s)]
*  How's the family? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=4000.52s)]
*  What about the poor woman who died? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7VL8Pa2bM&t=4001.52s)]
