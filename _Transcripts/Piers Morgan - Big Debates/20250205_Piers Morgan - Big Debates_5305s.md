Video Description: No one was expecting business as usual when Donald Trump returned to the US presidency last month - but even his most ardent supporters have been left open-mouthed after hearing his plan to send US Troops to the Gaza Strip as part of its recovery. For a man who campaigned on ending wars and bringing American troops home, this idea seems like something no one voted for. But is Trump simply playing the long game? If Gazans want to see into the future, should they be reading ‘The Art Of The Deal’?

For a vibrant debate on the topic, Piers Morgan brings on host of 'The Michael Knowles Show', Michael Knowles, Vincent Oshana from 'The PBD Podcast', Palestinian-American commentator Omar Baddar and author and host of 'The Scott Horton Show' Scott Horton onto Uncensored.

# "Playing Hard Ball!” Trump's Gaza Plan | Mustafa Barghouti & Michael Knowles
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw)
*  The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's utter lunacy that the president of the United States is speaking in those terms. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3.2s)]
*  The definition of insanity is to just keep repeating the same thing and expecting different [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=7.48s)]
*  results. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=11.88s)]
*  So say what you will about President Trump's plan. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=12.88s)]
*  The very fact that it's different makes it probably a lot saner. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=15.52s)]
*  The thing that has been done over and over again for decades, giving a carte blanche [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=18.48s)]
*  for Israel to behave however it wants to with the Palestinians. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=22.72s)]
*  There's over 64,000 people dead and now we're talking about building a paradise on top of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=25.4s)]
*  their bodies. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=31.88s)]
*  It's a little difficult for these years. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  Do you know what Vinny, I'm very, I don't know man. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  I wasn't expecting you to take that line so vehemently. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  America needs to cut all ties with all sides and just stay out of it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=39.36s)]
*  You talk about doing the same thing over and over, how about an independent Palestinian [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=43.6s)]
*  state? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=46.92s)]
*  I think it's an idea that's worth thinking about. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=47.92s)]
*  We shouldn't use cliches like ethnic cleansing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  And I'm not saying ridiculous things. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=54.56s)]
*  Please respect me. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=55.56s)]
*  You keep repeating the same thing Mr. President. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=56.56s)]
*  We do say the same thing because you don't answer the question. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=58.56s)]
*  Because you are biased to Israel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=62.32s)]
*  World leaders, scholars, diplomats, monarchs, activists and analysts have all spent decades [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  on failed plans for Gaza and the goal of bringing peace to Palestine. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  None of them has ever come up with anything remotely like this though. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=73.56s)]
*  The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=77.6s)]
*  We will own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=82.88s)]
*  other weapons on the site. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  Level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=96.16s)]
*  area. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=102.56s)]
*  Do a real job, do something different. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=103.56s)]
*  Just can't go back. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  If you go back it's going to end up the same way it has for a hundred years. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  Part of the Trump's Gaza Plan is to relocate about two million Palestinians to Jordan and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=111.52s)]
*  Egypt while the United States clears the war-torn strip and leads a massive project to rebuild [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=115.72s)]
*  it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=120.36s)]
*  With his real estate hat on in place of his red MAGA hat, the President imagines a glorious [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=121.36s)]
*  resort city for Palestinians and investors from all over the world. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  I think the potential in the Gaza Strip is unbelievable and I think the entire world, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=128.96s)]
*  representatives from all over the world will be there and they will live there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  Palestinians also, Palestinians will live there, many people will live there. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=139.12s)]
*  But they've tried the other and they've tried it for decades and decades and decades. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=143.56s)]
*  It's not going to work, it didn't work, it will never work. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=148.96s)]
*  And you have to learn from history. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  History has, you know, just can't let it keep repeating itself. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  And I don't want to be cute, I don't want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=164.56s)]
*  East, this could be something that could be so magnificent. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=169.52s)]
*  But more importantly than that is the people that have been absolutely destroyed that live [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  there now can live in peace in a much better situation because they're living in hell and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=179.08s)]
*  those people will now be able to live in peace. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, as ever with President Trump, there's a lot to unpack there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  He's right, the history cannot be allowed to repeat itself. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=191.12s)]
*  He's also right that Palestinians are living in hell. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=193.88000000000002s)]
*  The only radical breakthrough can end the cycle of endless violence and we have decades [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=197.8s)]
*  of suffering to prove it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=201.96s)]
*  But the Palestinians are not pawns on a chessboard. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  They certainly won't move by choice. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=205.56s)]
*  Forcing them to move is called by definition ethnic cleansing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=208.44s)]
*  And who's going to do the forcing anyway? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=211.28s)]
*  Israel has waged a brutal 15-month war in Gaza which didn't even depose Hamas. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=213.16000000000003s)]
*  Sending US troops to seize Gaza would be a drastic 180 on everything candidate Trump [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  stood for. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  And Congress may have one or two problems with a decades-long military occupation and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  a multi-billion dollar building plan. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=227.36s)]
*  As for Gazans returning to live in harmony with investors from around the world, well, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  good luck with that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=234.12s)]
*  Here's what I already think is going on here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=235.12s)]
*  Listen to the final part of Trump's press conference. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=236.8s)]
*  We'll make sure that it's done world class. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  It'll be wonderful for the people. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=241.84s)]
*  Palestinians mostly we're talking about and I have a feeling that despite them saying [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  no, I have a feeling that the king in Jordan and that the general president, but that the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=249.8s)]
*  general and Egypt will open their hearts and will give us the kind of land that we need [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=256.84s)]
*  to get this done and people can live in harmony and a peace. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=262.32s)]
*  Well, last week Egypt and Jordan set a ferocious node to the idea of essentially relocating [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  Gaza to their countries staunchly backed by Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=270.68s)]
*  So Trump, the deal-maker, has cranked up the heat. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=274.28s)]
*  He's made what once seemed outrageous feel like a sensible middle ground. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=276.32s)]
*  We've already seen this play out with Mexico and Canada on tariffs, with Colombia on migrants, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=280.52s)]
*  with Panama on the canal. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=284.72s)]
*  A deal with Denmark over the US presence in Greenland could be next. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=286.16s)]
*  We know that President Trump would love a Nobel Peace Prize to take back to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=289.56s)]
*  A big shiny deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel would be one hell of an entry. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=293.2s)]
*  Well, stacking the negotiating table with crazy demands that are designed to be sacrificed [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  might not be so crazy after all. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=302.32s)]
*  To debate all this and more, I'm joined by the host of The Michael Knowles Show on Daily [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  Wire, Michael Knowles, PBD podcast angry patriot, Vinnie O'Shauna, Palestinian-American commentator, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=307.68s)]
*  Omar Bader, director of the Libertarian Institute and host of the Scott Haughton Show. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=313.84s)]
*  Scott Haughton, welcome to all of you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=317.52s)]
*  Michael Knowles, let me start with you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  On the face of it, it's an outrageous idea by Donald Trump that involves the displacement [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=323.32s)]
*  of two million people from their homes where they've been for many, many decades. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=328.76s)]
*  They would say that they've been there for hundreds, if not thousands of years, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=334.28s)]
*  displacing them to neighbouring countries against their wishes because he thinks it [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=338.76s)]
*  can create some sort of peaceful utopia and Riviera on the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=344.36s)]
*  Many people think this is for the birds. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=348.68s)]
*  Many people think it is a form of ethnic cleansing by the purest definition of that phrase. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=350.68s)]
*  What do you think of it? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=355.12s)]
*  I mean, do you see good, bad and ugly here? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=356.12s)]
*  Do you think it's got merit? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=358.48s)]
*  What do you feel? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=359.76s)]
*  People can call it insane, but of course the definition of insanity is to just keep repeating [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=361.48s)]
*  the same thing and expecting different results. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=366.76s)]
*  So say what you will about President Trump's plan. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=369.32s)]
*  The very fact that it's different makes it probably a lot saner than the supposed peace [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=372.04s)]
*  plans we've had for almost a century now. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=375.92s)]
*  It's clear President Trump has never seen a piece of real estate that he didn't want [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=378.76s)]
*  to acquire and I think Greenland is a little more scenic than Gaza. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=381.92s)]
*  But nevertheless, perhaps a golf resort or a casino would look good in that area. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=386.12s)]
*  But I suspect you're right, Piers. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=391.04s)]
*  I think that probably President Trump is talking past the sale here. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  I think he is probably giving himself a lot of leverage here in a broader kind of negotiation. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=397.04s)]
*  But I don't want to evade the issue. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  You've brought up this issue of ethnic cleansing and this is something that I've been talking [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=404.24s)]
*  about for certainly the entire duration of this war and probably even earlier, which [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=408.16s)]
*  is that in this war you have two belligerents with the same rational strategic objective, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=413.76s)]
*  namely the ethnic cleansing of the other. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=421.24s)]
*  And so when we're talking about the Israelis, it does seem that the implicit and rational [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=424.32s)]
*  strategic objective would be to get the Palestinian Arabs out of Gaza because they can no longer [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=429.48s)]
*  tolerate the security risk that was proven on October 7th. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=434.88s)]
*  I don't blame them for it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=437.92s)]
*  If I were the Prime Minister of Israel, I would have the same view. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=439.24s)]
*  And we can't let the Palestinian Arabs off the hook here. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=442.24s)]
*  They elected Hamas. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=444.64s)]
*  Their explicit goal, their perfectly clearly stated goal is the ethnic cleansing, if not [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=446.04s)]
*  the outright genocide of Jews in Israel. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=451.56s)]
*  So I guess my question to people who are clutching their pearls and who are scratching their [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=453.6s)]
*  heads is, what did you expect to happen? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=457.76000000000005s)]
*  The fact that President Trump is at least giving a little bit of leverage for a broader [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=461.12s)]
*  deal here seems to me the best resolution that we've had so far. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=465.44s)]
*  The IRS is the largest collection agency in the world and it's just stepped up enforcement [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=472.08s)]
*  for 2025. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  If you owe back taxes or if you've unfilled returns, do not wait for the IRS to come after [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=477.71999999999997s)]
*  you. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=483.08s)]
*  Getting ahead of this is the smart move. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=484.08s)]
*  But never, never contact the IRS on your own. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=486.08s)]
*  Turn it over to the experts at Tax Network USA. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=490.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  Because not all tax resolution companies are equal. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=494.59999999999997s)]
*  Tax Network USA has a preferred direct line to the IRS. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=497.79999999999995s)]
*  That means they know which agents to deal with and which ones to avoid. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=502.04s)]
*  Tax Network USA has proven strategies that are designed to settle your tax problems in [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=506.84000000000003s)]

*  Their attorneys and negotiators have resolved over a billion dollars in tax debt. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=516.36s)]
*  You can talk to one of their strategists about your case for free. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=520.96s)]

*  Now on with the show. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=542.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting, Omar, because I've known Trump a long time and one of his [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=545.2s)]
*  favored techniques is to say something that sounds very outrageous, sounds very shocking, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=550.2s)]
*  and sounds very extreme, to jolt people to a negotiating table. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=555.7199999999999s)]
*  I've seen him do this many, many times. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=559.7199999999999s)]
*  We've just seen it with the tariffs, with Mexico, Canada and the ongoing rower China. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=561.7199999999999s)]
*  This is part of his playbook. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=566.7199999999999s)]
*  So I don't for a moment think that he believes this is actually achievable the way he laid out yesterday. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=568.7199999999999s)]
*  But do I think that there is some kind of middle ground here where America took charge of Gaza for the foreseeable future, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=574.7199999999999s)]
*  helped rebuild Gaza and that some people from Gaza do end up going to Jordan and Egypt, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=581.76s)]
*  as many have in the past, by the way, and the some would return to a revitalized, rebuilt Gaza. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=588.76s)]
*  Is that beyond the realms of acceptability to people in Palestine? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=595.76s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Piers, Trump has said many extreme things in the past, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=602.76s)]
*  but this is by far the most extreme position he has put out. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=606.76s)]
*  And that, quite frankly, is a very high bar, given the fanaticism with which he utters policy proposals on just about everything. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=609.8s)]
*  Effectively, at this point, what he's proposing is the destruction of Palestinian society in Gaza, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=616.8s)]
*  the scattering of Palestinians to neighboring countries, and then for Trump to come and own the Gaza Strip. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=621.8s)]
*  I mean, it's just, it's utter lunacy that the president of the United States is speaking in those terms. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=626.8s)]
*  And listening to Michael talk about insanity is doing the same thing over and over again. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=631.8s)]
*  The thing that has been done over and over again is Trump giving a carte blanche, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=635.8399999999999s)]
*  and the United States in general, for decades, giving a carte blanche for Israel to behave however it wants towards the Palestinians, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=640.8399999999999s)]
*  dominating them, besieging them, bombing them at will, and never putting any conditions on that support. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=646.8399999999999s)]
*  Frankly, if you want to do something different and try something different, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=651.8399999999999s)]
*  rather than turn to the victims of Israeli occupation and brutality for decades [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=655.8399999999999s)]
*  and say maybe the new thing we're going to try is to scatter you and send you somewhere else and ethnically cleanse you, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=659.8399999999999s)]
*  the new thing you should be trying is applying pressure on Israel to end its brutal occupation of the Palestinian territories, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=664.88s)]
*  to say that at this point, every major human rights organization in the world is describing Israel's onslaught in Gaza as genocidal, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=672.88s)]
*  and to say there's not going to be another penny from the United States unless this genocide comes to an immediate end, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=679.88s)]
*  and we start working towards allowing Palestinians to be a free people in their own country. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=685.88s)]
*  That is the trying something new that would actually achieve a better result, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=689.92s)]
*  rather than this insanity of looking at an entire history of utterly deranged American policy, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=694.92s)]
*  of just enabling Israel's worst behavior, and saying, well, the new thing, maybe we just have not been tough enough on the victims, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=700.92s)]
*  and that's why we must do different. It's utterly bonkers. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=705.92s)]
*  Okay, Vinny, what's your response to that? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=708.92s)]
*  Well, Piers, I have mixed emotions with this entire situation, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=710.9599999999999s)]
*  but I always like to go back to like, we can't talk about where we are today, Piers, until figuring out how we got here. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=714.9599999999999s)]
*  October 7th, you mentioned, Piers, 15 months ago, worst attack, almost, what, 1,300 civilians murdered by Hamas, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=719.9599999999999s)]
*  horrible, horrible day, but the fact that, and John Kirby came out a week after and said, people were asking, how could this happen? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=728.9599999999999s)]
*  How could the most secure piece of land in the entire planet, okay, Piers, I don't know if you've ever been to Israel, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=735.0s)]
*  the dogs walk past these freaking security, okay, so there's, you cannot tell me at all that Mossad, the Shin Bet, and the IDF, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=741.0s)]
*  not only had no idea that it happened, and it appears for six to 12 hours in certain places, this happened. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=749.0s)]
*  And when you have John Kirby coming up in front of the White House, and he was like, you know what, people were asking, what happened? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=755.0s)]
*  Now is not the time, and then Bibi's attitude, did you know what, maybe after the war, so I, no answer questions, nobody knows what happens, Piers, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=760.04s)]
*  but, and then also, October 13th, 2023, the Israeli Minister of Intelligence had a document coming out, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=767.04s)]
*  Alternatives to Political Directive for Civilian Population in Gaza, they had a plan ready to go, put all these people in tents, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=774.04s)]
*  disperse them around the Middle East, then to Europe, then to Canada, and use influence from the U.S. to pressure other countries to take these people, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=782.0799999999999s)]
*  okay, you mentioned Egypt doesn't want them, Jordan doesn't want them, I don't know how persuasive Trump is going to be to take people, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=789.0799999999999s)]
*  but I mean, Piers, put yourself in the innocent people, the people that have nothing to do with it, they're not terrorists, they don't support Hamas, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=796.0799999999999s)]
*  their country, their land, I'm sorry, is flattened, now they're going to be in the middle of the Middle East, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  and yeah, maybe these people could come back, Piers, there's over 64,000 people dead, I mean, what, over half women and children and innocent people, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=809.12s)]
*  and now we're talking about building a paradise on top of their bodies, it's a little difficult for me, Piers, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=816.12s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=823.12s)]
*  I'm a bit taken aback by, I wasn't expecting you to take that line so vehemently, because it seems to me that what you're basically saying is, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=824.12s)]
*  you feel this is a complete non-starter, this Trump idea, and should be, I'm putting words in your mouth, but should be just rejected. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=831.16s)]
*  No, well, Piers, here's my, and this is where I'm conflicted, like I said in the beginning, with this situation, Piers, when I was a kid, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=847.16s)]
*  and I would fight with my brother over a toy, okay, my father would come in, my mom would come in, and they'd warn us, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=854.16s)]
*  guys, stop fighting over this toy, and after three or four times, they'd finally come in and say, you know what, nobody's playing with the toy, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=859.1999999999999s)]
*  nobody gets the toy, okay, Piers, I'm a Christian, and that land, that land, Piers, is where Jesus Christ was, okay, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=866.1999999999999s)]
*  so I'm conflicted, Piers, because I want that land to be preserved, I want to be able to go there and visit, so maybe, Piers, maybe, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=873.1999999999999s)]
*  maybe this might be a good thing where Trump is going to come in, and just as long as there's no fighting, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  my only thing is the people that were there, they should have a right to come back to their land, Piers, plain and simple. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=885.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I certainly think that. Scott, Scott Halton, let me bring in Scott, he's not spoken yet. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=891.24s)]
*  Scott, look, the point, the part of Trump's speech which did resonate with me was, we've tried everything to sort this out, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=898.24s)]
*  and nothing has worked, and clearly, none of the ideas he's been given in the last few months, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=907.24s)]
*  preparing to come back into the White House, have made him think that any of that's going to work either, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=913.28s)]
*  so he's throwing something out there, a kind of fire bomb idea, I think, to rattle everyone's cage, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=918.28s)]
*  and try and force people to come to some kind of resolution that could work. That's my gut feeling. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=925.28s)]
*  I might be wrong, I sometimes am completely wrong about Donald Trump and what he really thinks, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=931.28s)]
*  but it just seems to me he's negotiating here, wanting people to get their heads together and work out what could work, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=936.28s)]
*  but what's your sense? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=942.3199999999999s)]
*  I agree with that, and your opening statement for this segment too, that he's playing hardball, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=944.3199999999999s)]
*  and I suppose he's trying to get Qatar, Saudi, Egypt, Jordan to take responsibility, probably, for the occupation and rebuilding, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=950.3199999999999s)]
*  and then also, of course, as we're talking about here, the cleansing and the so-called resettlement of these people, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=957.3199999999999s)]
*  so I think any mention of, oh yeah, no, we're going to make a nice place for the Palestinians to live, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=964.3199999999999s)]
*  they don't mean that. When they say, oh yeah, people of the area are going to take over Gaza now, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=969.36s)]
*  they mean Israeli Jews are going to replace the people there, and the thing is, America can't do that. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=975.36s)]
*  I mean, the Pentagon, I don't know if he talked to the generals before he said that or anything, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=981.36s)]
*  or exactly what he has in mind if he really thinks he's going to do that, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=986.36s)]
*  but that would mean American GIs and Marines in the place of the IDF, and as we just saw, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=989.36s)]
*  getting shot, killing people, getting killed, and achieving nothing for it, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=996.4s)]
*  and they wouldn't be able to cleanse the place anyway, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1000.4s)]
*  so it's not like they're just going to walk in there and shoe everyone out, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1003.4s)]
*  and they're going to listen to us instead of the Israelis now, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1006.4s)]
*  so I agree that it's an opening position for, at least I certainly hope he's just trying to get someone else to take responsibility for it, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1009.4s)]
*  but I'm for a total non-intervention on this. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1018.4s)]
*  America needs to cut all ties with all sides and just stay out of it. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1021.4s)]
*  I have my opinions about how things should be. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1025.44s)]
*  You talk about doing the same thing over and over. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1028.44s)]
*  How about an independent Palestinian state, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1030.44s)]
*  or how about separation of church and state and a secular state with citizenship for everybody [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1032.44s)]
*  between the river and the sea and equal rights for everybody? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1039.44s)]
*  Those are my opinions, but I do not think that is the role of the United States government to dictate that, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1041.44s)]
*  but we need to cut off all aid and certainly all weapons to Israel, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1047.44s)]
*  all diplomatic support for them in their war crimes. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1053.48s)]
*  After all, for conservatives who believe in the rule of law, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1055.48s)]
*  the Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 46, is the law. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1059.48s)]
*  There are federal laws. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1063.48s)]
*  That treaty was written mostly by Americans in the first place, ratified by the U.S. Senate, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1064.48s)]
*  and there are federal laws implementing the Geneva Conventions in the United States, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1069.48s)]
*  and it is illegal to replace a civilian population to help another country to do so either, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1073.48s)]
*  certainly in the name of Lebensraum, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1079.48s)]
*  and Trump literally said, well, geez, Israel is such a small country [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1081.52s)]
*  in answer to whether he supports the annexation of the West Bank, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1084.52s)]
*  and that is where part of this conversation needs to go, too. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1087.52s)]
*  As soon as they had a ceasefire in Gaza, they moved to the West Bank, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1090.52s)]
*  and they made it very clear they would like to annex the West Bank, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1093.52s)]
*  and if we see in the West Bank the kind of slaughter we just saw in Gaza for the last year and a half, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1095.52s)]
*  it is within the realm of possibility. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1100.52s)]
*  You could see them bombing those cities and trying to force the Palestinians to flee into Jordan [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1103.52s)]
*  and to go ahead and finish the job. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1108.52s)]
*  Now, the only restraint on that apparently is not America. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1110.56s)]
*  The only restraint on that is will it destroy Israel's relations [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1113.56s)]
*  with all the Sunni kingdoms of the GCC and Egypt and Jordan, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1116.56s)]
*  because if it does, then there goes their new alliance that they're building against Shiite Iran, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1121.56s)]
*  and so that's really the only thing hedging them in, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1126.56s)]
*  but if America is willing to take on Iran for them, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1129.56s)]
*  then they might decide it's worth it. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1132.56s)]
*  We need to just absolutely butt out starting right now. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1134.56s)]
*  OK, Michael, it's very interesting to me watching... [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1137.6s)]
*  I'm in London at the moment, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1139.6s)]
*  but watching a lot of conservative right in America [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1141.6s)]
*  turning more and more against President Zelensky, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1145.6s)]
*  who I interviewed yesterday, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1148.6s)]
*  and the battle against Russia that Ukraine has been fighting, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1151.6s)]
*  which I've always believed was a sickening, illegal invasion [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1155.6s)]
*  of a sovereign democratic European country, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1160.6s)]
*  and that whatever claims Putin makes about being provoked and so on [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1162.6s)]
*  actually is just a cover for the fact he wishes the Soviet Union [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  never got dismantled, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1169.6399999999999s)]
*  and he'd love to get it all back if he could. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1171.6399999999999s)]
*  But putting that aside, a lot of conservatives in America now... [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1174.6399999999999s)]
*  Pierce, I'll send you a copy of the book. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1177.6399999999999s)]
*  If you just have your producer send my guy your mailing address there. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1179.6399999999999s)]
*  I would love to. We'll do that. Thank you very much. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1182.6399999999999s)]
*  Always like to read your stuff. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1184.6399999999999s)]
*  But, Michael, the point I was going to make was, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1186.6399999999999s)]
*  is there not an inconsistency here between the conservatives in America, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1189.6399999999999s)]
*  and many of them now, a big number, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1194.68s)]
*  who want no involvement in Ukraine because it's thousands of miles away, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1196.68s)]
*  it's not our problem, we shouldn't get involved in this, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1200.68s)]
*  America first, MAGA, so on, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1203.68s)]
*  and yet here you have another situation which is thousands of miles away. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1205.68s)]
*  You could put exactly the same arguments up that Israel v Hamas [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1209.68s)]
*  has nothing to do with America, exactly as Scott just said, really. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1213.68s)]
*  And is there not... [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1218.68s)]
*  I had this conversation with Tucker Carlson in Saudi Arabia last week [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1220.68s)]
*  and I think he struggled a bit, actually, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1223.72s)]
*  to explain why one deserves America's fulsome support [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1225.72s)]
*  and the other doesn't. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1229.72s)]
*  Can you articulate it better for me? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1231.72s)]
*  I hope I can. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1234.72s)]
*  I think there's no inconsistency because the principle is that [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1236.72s)]
*  we American conservatives generally trust Trump's gut [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1239.72s)]
*  and strategy on foreign policy. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1243.72s)]
*  That's not hero worship, that's not idolatry, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1245.72s)]
*  that is a rational prejudice that we have arrived at [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1248.72s)]
*  because President Trump has achieved better results on foreign policy [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1251.76s)]
*  than any presidents in our lifetime, certainly in my lifetime, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1254.76s)]
*  Republican or Democrat. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1257.76s)]
*  That wasn't the question. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1259.76s)]
*  The question was, what's the difference ideologically [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1261.76s)]
*  between America getting involved in helping Ukraine repel Russia [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1264.76s)]
*  and America getting involved in helping Israel repel Hamas? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1268.76s)]
*  They're both thousands of miles away, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1272.76s)]
*  they're conflicts that don't directly involve America. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1274.76s)]
*  What is the ideological difference? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1276.76s)]
*  Well, I suppose we have to shift the premise a little bit here. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1278.8s)]
*  America is involved in everything. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1281.8s)]
*  Pache, to my libertarian friends, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1284.8s)]
*  America is involved in everything. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1286.8s)]
*  That is in part because we're the global hegemon, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1288.8s)]
*  that is in part because we are an empire [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1291.8s)]
*  and have been an empire for a very long time. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1293.8s)]
*  It is in part because nations have interests. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1295.8s)]
*  All nations have interests, even tiny little nations have interests [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1298.8s)]
*  and they seek to influence other nations [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1301.8s)]
*  to better accord with those interests. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1304.8s)]
*  So we are going to be involved in some way all over the world, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1307.84s)]
*  whether that is in Ukraine or whether that is in the Middle East. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1311.84s)]
*  The question is, how are we going to be involved? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1314.84s)]
*  And here I think President Trump's commentary [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1317.84s)]
*  was really, really important. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1319.84s)]
*  Trump says on the one hand, we're going to take over Gaza, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1321.84s)]
*  we're going to own Gaza. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1324.84s)]
*  You saw Netanyahu's eyebrow went up. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1325.84s)]
*  I'm not sure he was totally prepared for that one [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1327.84s)]
*  during their press conference. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1329.84s)]
*  On the other hand, he says, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1330.84s)]
*  someone else is going to pay for all of this, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1332.84s)]
*  we're not going to pay for this, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1334.84s)]
*  and other people are going to figure it out. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1336.8799999999999s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1338.8799999999999s)]
*  If he says we're going to take over Gaza, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1340.8799999999999s)]
*  we're going to own Gaza, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1342.8799999999999s)]
*  people I think assumed that that means [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1344.8799999999999s)]
*  we're going to send in the Marines [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1346.8799999999999s)]
*  or that we're at least going to send in [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1348.8799999999999s)]
*  the Trump Organization contractors to build an ice casino. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1350.8799999999999s)]
*  On the other hand, the Marines cost money. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1352.8799999999999s)]
*  So if someone else is going to pay for this, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1354.8799999999999s)]
*  then it seems to me President Trump is saying, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1356.8799999999999s)]
*  no, we're not going to be directly involved, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1358.8799999999999s)]
*  we're just going to put a stop to this war, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1360.8799999999999s)]
*  which is why I think our other co-panelists here [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1362.8799999999999s)]
*  who makes the suggestion that Trump [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1365.92s)]
*  is always just giving the Israelis exactly what they want [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1367.92s)]
*  is totally absurd. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1369.92s)]
*  President Trump got a ceasefire [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1370.92s)]
*  over the objection of many Israelis. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1372.92s)]
*  President Trump has helped the Palestinian people [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1374.92s)]
*  a lot more than any presidents in our lifetimes. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1376.92s)]
*  And so I think what you're seeing here [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1379.92s)]
*  is... [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1381.92s)]
*  That's literally the most ridiculous thing [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1382.92s)]
*  that has ever been said. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1383.92s)]
*  Well, I think it's... [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1384.92s)]
*  He's done more to undermine Palestinians [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1385.92s)]
*  than every turn. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1387.92s)]
*  Is that ridiculous? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1388.92s)]
*  Yeah, he did bring about a temporary ceasefire [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1390.92s)]
*  before he's about to propose a full ethnic cleansing. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1392.92s)]
*  Listen, I have to interject here [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1394.96s)]
*  because Trump has done more [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1395.96s)]
*  to undermine Palestinian rights. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1397.96s)]
*  He's recognized Israel's illegal occupation, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1399.96s)]
*  illegal settlements... [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1401.96s)]
*  What rights? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1402.96s)]
*  Recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1403.96s)]
*  and violation of international law. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1405.96s)]
*  That had been U.S. policy for three decades. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1407.96s)]
*  There is entire unanimity of condemnation [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1409.96s)]
*  of Israel's illegal occupation [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1412.96s)]
*  that Trump has recognized. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1414.96s)]
*  And just from that point, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1415.96s)]
*  I really have to say that I'm fundamentally... [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1416.96s)]
*  Unanimity. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1418.96s)]
*  Yeah, global hegemon acting like a rogue state [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1419.96s)]
*  in order to enable another rogue state. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1424.0s)]
*  Yes, the entire world... [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1426.0s)]
*  If you look at the logs of the international... [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1427.0s)]
*  The entire world, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1430.0s)]
*  except for the guys who control the world. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1431.0s)]
*  It's obvious that Israel and the U.S. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1432.0s)]
*  are out of step with the rest of the world [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1434.0s)]
*  on illegal occupation. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1436.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just being condescended [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1437.0s)]
*  to somebody who does not know [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1438.0s)]
*  what they're talking about [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1439.0s)]
*  is just... [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1440.0s)]
*  It's always a wonderful experience. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1441.0s)]
*  Maybe listen a little bit [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1442.0s)]
*  and try to learn and understand [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1443.0s)]
*  actually how the world works. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1444.0s)]
*  The United States is the global hegemon [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1445.0s)]
*  and we don't need to pay... [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1446.0s)]
*  No, you don't know what you're talking about. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1447.0s)]
*  You're incredibly out of your depth. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1448.0s)]
*  Okay, let me... [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1449.0s)]
*  I think... [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1450.0s)]
*  Allow me to say a few words [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1451.0s)]
*  uninterrupted if you don't mind. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1452.0s)]
*  I think you've said a lot of words. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1453.04s)]
*  I'm extremely uncomfortable with the idea. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1454.04s)]
*  The United States is the global hegemon. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1456.04s)]
*  You've been speaking over me [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1458.04s)]
*  the entire time I've been speaking. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1459.04s)]
*  Allow me to make my points. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1461.04s)]
*  Guys, time out. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1463.04s)]
*  We can't actually hear... [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1464.04s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1466.04s)]
*  We can't hear either of you. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1467.04s)]
*  Omar, say what you want to say [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1468.04s)]
*  and then I'll let Michael respond. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1469.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1472.04s)]
*  First, I want to say [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1473.04s)]
*  that I'm incredibly object to the suggestion [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1474.04s)]
*  that the entire Palestine-Israel conflict [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1478.04s)]
*  is like two children [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1480.04s)]
*  fighting over a neutral toy [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1481.08s)]
*  and the parent needs to come and say [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1482.08s)]
*  it belongs to neither of you [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1484.08s)]
*  and neither of you gets to play with it. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1485.08s)]
*  The correct analogy, if you want to use that, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1486.08s)]
*  it's a parent walking their spoiled child [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1488.08s)]
*  out in the street finding another toy, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1490.08s)]
*  another kid who has his own toy [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1492.08s)]
*  and letting their own child [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1494.08s)]
*  get on top of that other kid, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1495.08s)]
*  beat the living crap out of them [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1497.08s)]
*  and take the toy out of their hands. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1498.08s)]
*  And what you need is for the parent to say [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1499.08s)]
*  let go of that other kid's toy [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1502.08s)]
*  and leave it alone. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1504.08s)]
*  The entire world agrees. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1505.08s)]
*  There's no debate, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1507.08s)]
*  especially on Gaza and the West, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1508.08s)]
*  that those are occupied Palestinian territories [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1509.12s)]
*  that Israel has no legal title to whatsoever. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1511.12s)]
*  This is the entire UN. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1514.12s)]
*  This is the International Court of Justice, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1515.12s)]
*  the General Assembly, the Security Council, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1517.12s)]
*  every major organization in the world. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1520.12s)]
*  Everybody recognizes that [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1522.12s)]
*  this is Palestinian territory [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1523.12s)]
*  that Israel has no legal right to. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1524.12s)]
*  And so that's the dynamic. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1526.12s)]
*  And if, again, you want to try something [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1527.12s)]
*  a little bit different [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1530.12s)]
*  and say the idea that Trump [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1531.12s)]
*  is more pro-Palestinian, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1532.12s)]
*  is done more for Palestinians, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1534.12s)]
*  literally means that the world is more pro-Palestinian [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1535.12s)]
*  and more pro-Palestinian. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1538.1599999999999s)]
*  Literally, he's done nothing [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1539.1599999999999s)]
*  but strip Palestinian rights inch by inch [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1540.1599999999999s)]
*  in a world in which the U.S. has always said [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1542.1599999999999s)]
*  by, on the one hand, saying [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1545.1599999999999s)]
*  Palestinians deserve their own state, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1548.1599999999999s)]
*  they deserve freedom from Israeli occupation, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1550.1599999999999s)]
*  where U.S. actions were essentially [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1552.1599999999999s)]
*  to allow Israel to continue [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1554.1599999999999s)]
*  to entrench that occupation [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1555.1599999999999s)]
*  without any question. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1557.1599999999999s)]
*  Trump came along [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1558.1599999999999s)]
*  and made the rhetoric match the policy. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1559.1599999999999s)]
*  He fixed it in the wrong direction, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1561.1599999999999s)]
*  which means that now Netanyahu [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1563.1599999999999s)]
*  is having his wish list. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1564.1599999999999s)]
*  What he wants to do [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1566.2s)]
*  is empty Palestine of indigenous Palestinians [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1567.2s)]
*  in order to make it a Jewish supremacist state [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1570.2s)]
*  and not have the apartheid problem anymore [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1572.2s)]
*  where Israel rules over Palestinians [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1575.2s)]
*  without granting them rights. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1576.2s)]
*  And when you come and give that to Israel, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1578.2s)]
*  you're not pro-Palestinian, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1580.2s)]
*  and it's utterly absurd and ridiculous [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1582.2s)]
*  for anybody to suggest that Trump [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1583.2s)]
*  has done anything for Palestinians. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1584.2s)]
*  Okay, I'll let Michael respond to that, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1585.2s)]
*  then I'm going to come to the other reaction. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1587.2s)]
*  Michael? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1590.2s)]
*  I think it's kind of silly to say [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1591.2s)]
*  there's total unanimity on the matter [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1592.2s)]
*  of Israel and Palestine [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1595.24s)]
*  when we're sitting on a panel [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1596.24s)]
*  debating the matter of Israel-Palestine [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1597.24s)]
*  and especially when the global hegemon, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1599.24s)]
*  the United States of America, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1602.24s)]
*  disagrees with all of the two-bit [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1603.24s)]
*  international institutions [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1605.24s)]
*  and non-government organizations [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1606.24s)]
*  that you're citing. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1608.24s)]
*  So it's simply a matter of fact. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1609.24s)]
*  It's a longstanding controversy. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1611.24s)]
*  And if you're talking about Palestinian rights, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1613.24s)]
*  we need to be specific [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1617.24s)]
*  as to what those rights are. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1618.24s)]
*  There has never been any such thing [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1619.24s)]
*  as a Palestinian nation state. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1621.24s)]
*  It's incredible that you think [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1623.28s)]
*  that that's a legitimate dispute. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1624.28s)]
*  You know, I allowed you to spew [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1626.28s)]
*  your ridiculous propaganda, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1627.28s)]
*  but perhaps you could allow me to, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1628.28s)]
*  but you're not. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1629.28s)]
*  Maybe you're not capable [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1630.28s)]
*  of complying with yourself [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1631.28s)]
*  in a conversation, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1632.28s)]
*  much as the Palestinian Arabs and Gaz [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1633.28s)]
*  are not capable of electing [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1635.24s)]
*  a legitimate government. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1636.24s)]
*  So, all right, keep talking. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1638.28s)]
*  Thank you for that racist dig. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1639.28s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1640.28s)]
*  But no, no, let's just be clear. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1641.28s)]
*  Racist? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1642.28s)]
*  I'm the same color as the Palestinians. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1643.28s)]
*  What the U.S. is saying [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1644.28s)]
*  is that Israel is above the law. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1645.28s)]
*  And if you think that that makes it [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1646.28s)]
*  a legitimate dispute [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1647.28s)]
*  about what the law is, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1648.28s)]
*  that's an absurd presentation. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1649.28s)]
*  When did I answer that? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1650.28s)]
*  When did I ever say that? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1651.32s)]
*  You're trying to stop me from speaking. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1652.32s)]

*  Palestinian state to exist [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1818.4s)]
*  kept entrenching the occupation [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1819.4s)]
*  and insisting [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1820.4s)]
*  that Palestinians [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1821.4s)]
*  must live forever [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1822.4s)]
*  under the boot [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1823.4s)]
*  of Israeli occupation [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1824.4s)]
*  that's when support [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1825.4s)]
*  for Hamas rose [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1826.4s)]
*  and Hamas became [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1827.4s)]
*  a political force [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1828.4s)]
*  to contend with. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1829.4s)]
*  So if you have a problem [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1830.4s)]
*  with Hamas being empowered [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1831.4s)]
*  the obvious alternative [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1832.4s)]
*  is to create a peaceful path [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1833.4s)]
*  where Palestinians [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1834.4s)]
*  can be a free people [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1835.4s)]
*  and as long as [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1836.4s)]
*  American policy [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1837.4s)]
*  is to enable Israel [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1838.4s)]
*  denying Palestinians [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1839.4s)]
*  freedom [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1840.4s)]
*  that is precisely [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1841.4s)]
*  what empowers [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1842.4s)]
*  groups like Hamas [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1843.4s)]
*  and makes it impossible [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1844.4s)]
*  that we're going to [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1845.4s)]
*  get rid of groups [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1846.4s)]

*  for violence [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1848.4s)]
*  as a means of achieving [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1849.4s)]
*  liberation [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1850.4s)]
*  when Israel has blocked [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1851.4s)]
*  every other avenue [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1852.4s)]
*  Scott Horton [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1853.4s)]
*  you know [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1854.4s)]
*  the obvious response [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1855.4s)]
*  I have to what [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1856.4s)]
*  Trump has said is [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1857.4s)]
*  okay if you find [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1858.4s)]
*  that idea completely [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1859.4s)]
*  objectionable [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1860.4s)]
*  and outrageous [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1861.4s)]
*  and shocking [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1862.4s)]
*  and it can't possibly happen [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1863.4s)]
*  then what's a better one? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1864.4s)]
*  I mean in your eyes [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1865.4s)]
*  what is the best way [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1866.4s)]
*  that is achievable [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1867.4s)]
*  to move out of this war [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1868.4s)]
*  into genuine [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1869.4s)]
*  potential for peace? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1870.4s)]
*  I think it's going to take years [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1871.4s)]
*  whatever way you take [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1872.4s)]
*  given all the history here [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1873.4s)]
*  and given the events [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1874.4s)]
*  of the last 15 months [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1875.4s)]
*  and I think [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1876.4s)]
*  that's going to be [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1877.4s)]
*  a very important [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1878.4s)]
*  point [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1879.4s)]
*  and I think [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1880.4s)]
*  that's going to be [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1881.4s)]
*  a very important point [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1882.4s)]
*  given all the history here [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1883.4s)]

*  of the last 15 months [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1885.4s)]
*  but what is the more [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1886.4s)]
*  credible achievable [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1887.4s)]
*  pathway [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1888.4s)]
*  if it's not [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1889.4s)]
*  the way Trump's [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1890.4s)]
*  suggesting? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1891.4s)]
*  Well you're right [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1892.4s)]
*  that it's been [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1893.4s)]
*  a horrific setback [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1894.4s)]
*  for peace [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1895.4s)]
*  you know going forward [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1896.4s)]
*  just of what's happened [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1897.4s)]
*  since [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1898.4s)]
*  you know [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1899.4s)]
*  including [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1900.4s)]
*  and since [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1901.4s)]
*  October the 7th [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1902.4s)]
*  it's a real catastrophe [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1903.4s)]
*  but there are places [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1904.4s)]
*  around the planet [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1905.4s)]
*  where people have [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1906.4s)]
*  some or another [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1907.4s)]
*  form of [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1908.4s)]
*  some or another form [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1909.4s)]
*  of binational [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1910.4s)]
*  type of state [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1911.4s)]
*  where they have [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1912.4s)]
*  their own [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1913.4s)]
*  local security forces [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1914.4s)]
*  under one government [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1915.4s)]
*  and there are places [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1916.4s)]
*  where you have [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1917.4s)]
*  extremely bad blood [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1918.4s)]
*  historically [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1919.4s)]
*  but where it's [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1920.4s)]
*  basically worked out [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1921.4s)]
*  for example [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1922.4s)]
*  there are millions [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1923.4s)]
*  of ethnic Germans [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1924.4s)]
*  that still live [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1925.4s)]
*  inside France [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1926.4s)]
*  but they're free [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1927.4s)]
*  and so there's [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1928.4s)]
*  nothing to fight about [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1929.4s)]
*  and but of course [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1930.4s)]
*  Germany and France [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1931.4s)]
*  have fought [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1932.4s)]
*  over the millennia [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1933.4s)]
*  right there's [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1934.4s)]
*  if you want bad blood [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1935.4s)]
*  you can have some [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1936.4s)]
*  but you can't [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1937.4s)]
*  if you want bad blood [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1938.4s)]
*  you can have some [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1939.4s)]
*  there's also [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1940.4s)]
*  essentially a status quo [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1941.4s)]
*  holding in Bosnia [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1942.4s)]
*  where there's [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1943.4s)]
*  tons of bad blood [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1944.4s)]
*  between the Bosnian [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1945.4s)]
*  Serbs, Croats [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1946.4s)]
*  and Muslims [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1947.4s)]
*  and they went through [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1948.4s)]
*  horrific fighting [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1949.4s)]
*  for years [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1950.4s)]
*  but then they stopped [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1951.4s)]
*  and they could get up [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1952.4s)]
*  in the morning [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1953.4s)]
*  and get revenge [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1954.4s)]
*  for their brother [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1955.4s)]
*  that died in the thing [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1956.4s)]
*  or they can get up [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1957.4s)]
*  and go to work [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1958.4s)]
*  and so if the dynamics [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1959.4s)]
*  are changed [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1960.4s)]
*  severely enough [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1961.4s)]
*  then things can go back [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1962.4s)]
*  to hell [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1963.4s)]
*  but it goes to show [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1964.4s)]
*  that people can [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1965.4s)]
*  put the past aside [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1966.4s)]
*  Well you know [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1967.4s)]
*  we had it close [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1968.4s)]
*  closer to where I am [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1969.4s)]
*  we had it in [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1970.4s)]
*  Northern Ireland of course [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1971.4s)]
*  you know [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1972.4s)]
*  where for many decades [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1973.4s)]
*  it seemed completely [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1974.4s)]
*  intractable [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1975.4s)]
*  you had two groups [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1976.4s)]
*  led by paramilitaries [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1977.4s)]
*  terrorists [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1979.4s)]
*  whatever you want to call [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1980.4s)]
*  all of them [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1981.4s)]
*  but they were [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1982.4s)]
*  you know [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1983.4s)]
*  terrible actions on both sides [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1984.4s)]
*  throughout the troubles [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1985.4s)]
*  in Northern Ireland [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1986.4s)]
*  but eventually [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1987.4s)]
*  clear headed [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1988.4s)]
*  new leadership [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=1989.4s)]

*  what seemed to me [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2039.4s)]

*  in other words [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2057.4s)]
*  it's clearly [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2058.4s)]
*  a pathway [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2059.4s)]

*  in peace together [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2062.4s)]
*  and it just begs [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2063.4s)]
*  the question [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2064.4s)]
*  why can't it [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2065.4s)]
*  be achieved [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2066.4s)]
*  in Gaza [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2067.4s)]
*  on the West Bank [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2068.4s)]
*  or in other words [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2069.4s)]
*  why can't you extend [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2070.4s)]
*  what's happened [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2071.4s)]
*  in Jerusalem [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2072.4s)]
*  elsewhere [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2073.4s)]

*  too many [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2075.4s)]
*  and that would ruin [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2076.4s)]
*  the 80-20 super-duper [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2077.4s)]

*  I forget his last name [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2099.4s)]

*  and this was [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2101.4s)]
*  he was advising [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2102.4s)]

*  the Palestinian state [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2111.4s)]
*  give them Gaza [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2112.4s)]
*  but what this guy [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2113.4s)]
*  is explaining is [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2114.4s)]
*  there's just [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2115.4s)]
*  too many [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2116.4s)]

*  Strip in 2005 [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2126.4s)]
*  what we'll do is [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2128.4s)]

*  kicking Gaza [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2132.4s)]

*  that way it won't be [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2138.4s)]
*  sort of this 50-50 [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2140.4s)]
*  split where it's [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2141.4s)]
*  really we get accused [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2142.4s)]

*  apartheid state [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2144.4s)]
*  now we'll count [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2145.4s)]
*  six million [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2146.4s)]

*  the West Bank [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2150.4s)]

*  look as bad as [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2152.4s)]
*  an apartheid [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2153.4s)]

*  to fight and resist [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2161.4s)]
*  and then he says [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2162.4s)]
*  we'll just have to [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2163.4s)]
*  kill and kill and kill [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2164.4s)]

*  this is really just a way to set the table for a negotiation. So it seems to me, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2323.32s)]
*  sure, there's risk in anything in this life, but when you're beginning with such destruction, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2329.88s)]

*  Okay, I want to switch gears and talk about USAID, which is this agency that's basically [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2339.96s)]
*  been shut down. Elon Musk appears to have led this, obviously with Trump's approval. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2345.56s)]
*  Trump told reporters it was run by a bunch of radical lunatics and we're getting them out. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2352.92s)]
*  Vinnie, what do you make of this? I mean, it's got a workforce of 10,000 people, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2358.28s)]

*  Caroline Levitt said about it. These are some of the insane priorities that that organization [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2375.6400000000003s)]
*  has been spending money on. 1.5 million dollars to advance DEI in Serbia's workplaces, 70,000 for a [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2382.28s)]

*  want my dollars going towards this crap and I know the American people don't either and that's exactly [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2403.88s)]
*  what Elon Musk has been tasked by President Trump to do. Vinnie, I've got to say, when she put it [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2408.04s)]
*  like that, I found myself nodding. What did you do? I mean, Piers, I touched on this a couple of [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2413.08s)]
*  days ago. That's just a couple of the egregious monies that we were spending. We were spending [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2421.4s)]
*  $230,000 on K-Cups, Starbucks drinks. The numbers are astronomical. It's insane, Piers, and you [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2427.08s)]
*  can see that the left is losing their minds because all of their wallets are about to get really, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2436.04s)]
*  really thin. From Jamie Raskin to Ilhan Omar to all these people. But you know what, Piers? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2441.64s)]
*  We've been getting walked over from the inside out, okay? And you know what? The left, Piers, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2447.64s)]
*  they are not used to having an alpha like Donald Trump come in and tell them, guys, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2452.68s)]
*  I made the promises and I'm going to keep them, okay? Joe Biden was a freaking doormat and [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2459.3999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump is a matador, okay? He's a bull. He's not BSing. And now you see the last night, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2465.0s)]
*  they had all these Democrat people on the hills talking about, Ilhan is this, he's racist, he's a [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2470.12s)]
*  Nazi. Let's take to him in the street. They're calling for freaking violence like the BLM riots [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2475.48s)]
*  against this. And you know what, Piers? This is all normal. These are growing pains that they're [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2480.68s)]
*  all going to learn that the taking advantage of our freaking system is over, Piers, and I absolutely [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2484.7599999999998s)]
*  love it. Let them cry. Let them cry and whine. It's over. Just like Piers, just like RFK trying [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2490.7599999999998s)]
*  to get confirmed. You know, Big Pharma, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren look like they're [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2496.2799999999997s)]
*  going to have heart attacks because they're all the Big Pharma donors, okay? And just like Cash [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2501.56s)]
*  Patel, FBI, he's going to put everybody on notice and he's going to investigate everybody if they [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2505.0s)]
*  broke the law, Piers, and I absolutely love what's happening. Okay. Omar, I saw you shaking your head [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2510.12s)]
*  there. I mean, just to be clear, I mean, do you support the United States providing $70,000 for [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2515.08s)]
*  production of a DEI musical in Ireland or $47,000 for a transgender opera in Colombia? Because it [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2522.52s)]
*  seems completely insane that America is spending this kind of money. If we, listen, if we dig into [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2529.56s)]
*  humanitarian programs and development programs, we might find a few thousand dollars here and [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2536.6s)]
*  there that are misspent and could potentially be wasteful. But it's just incredible that we're [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2540.36s)]
*  talking about this when the real waste is the military industrial complex. It's sending billions [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2544.44s)]
*  of dollars to a genocidal government that is wiping Gaza off the face of the earth. That's where the [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2550.2799999999997s)]
*  waste is. It's not chasing these few thousand dollars here and there. To be talking about that [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2556.04s)]
*  at a time in which the Pentagon budget is just over bloated, it ends in the pockets of private [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2560.2s)]
*  military contractors at a time when the US would not negotiate the drug crisis down. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2564.84s)]
*  Okay, look, let me stop you. In a way you're making it kind of distract... My point is... [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2569.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, you're making it... Hang on, what you're doing, you're playing kind of water batteries. In other [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2574.52s)]
*  words, there's another area of overspending. Maybe they'll get to that. Let's wait and see [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2577.32s)]
*  about the overspending by the Pentagon. They might. I mean, I'm holding my breath, but they might. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2581.2400000000002s)]
*  But they won't. But they won't. We know they won't, Piers. Omar, my point is that Elon Musk is going [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2585.08s)]
*  through a lot of federal spending. America spends a gigantic sum of money, 17 trillion [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2589.64s)]
*  dollars in debt, maybe more now, I think. They've got to do something. Elon's taking his shredder [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2594.6s)]
*  to this. And so I'll just ask you again, on those two examples I gave you, do you think it's right [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2599.72s)]
*  that America spends that kind of money? Because it seems to me an obvious place to start if you're [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2605.3199999999997s)]
*  going to trim federal spending. Yeah, again, I don't agree that this is the right place to start. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2609.7999999999997s)]
*  Again, to be chasing down a few thousand dollars here and there in random programs... Well, it's [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2615.48s)]
*  millions, actually. It's many millions. They actually manage 43 billion dollars in appropriations. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2619.16s)]
*  It's not a few thousand here and there, is it, Omar? It's a lot of money. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2630.7599999999998s)]
*  But I'm saying if you're looking at individual programs, again, when you're saying 73,000 for [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2635.72s)]
*  this and 400,000 for that, what about the 20 billion for Israeli war crimes against... [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2639.64s)]
*  All right, yeah, you made that point. That to me is the obvious point to start. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2644.04s)]
*  All right, let me bring in Mike. Let's not just what about is him. It's about scale. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2646.84s)]
*  I think Scott, hang on, Scott, Scott wants to respond and then I'll bring Michael in on this. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2649.88s)]
*  Scott? Yeah. Omar, my guy, you're blowing it, man. All you have to do is say yes, absolutely. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2653.7200000000003s)]
*  I agree and we should all agree about this and about the Pentagon too, man. It's one big empire. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2659.1600000000003s)]
*  And I'm sorry for for Pierce and everybody, the crisis and the scandal with USAID is not just [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2664.6800000000003s)]
*  pissing away money on these kind of ridiculous things, as you name. This is the major engine of [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2669.96s)]
*  regime change overseas. We get distracted by things like George W. Bush marching the entire [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2675.72s)]
*  Third Infantry Division into Iraq and things like that. But starting in late Clinton and through [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2681.0s)]
*  W. Bush and Obama, we've had what are called the color coded revolutions all over, mostly in Eastern [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2685.8799999999997s)]
*  Europe and in Russia's near abroad, mostly overthrowing governments that are friendly [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2693.3999999999996s)]
*  to the Russians and helping to cause this horrible new Cold War that we're in right now. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2697.64s)]
*  And they started it in the Balkans in the late 1990s and with, of course, Serbia in the year 2000, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2701.88s)]
*  Georgia in 2003, Ukraine the first time in 2004. They did it again in 14. They did the failed Denim [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2708.52s)]
*  Revolution in Belarus and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan and the failed Cedar Revolution [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2715.88s)]
*  in Lebanon in 2005 and on and on like this. And the worst crisis, the worst thing that USAID has [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2722.76s)]
*  ever done by far is 10 years ago, they're avowed support for the bin Ladenites in Syria in Barack [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2729.24s)]
*  Obama's dirty war on behalf of the Syrians. And this is where, pardon me, the Syrian so-called [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2736.4399999999996s)]
*  revolution, which was really Al-Qaeda in Iraq in Syria, the bad guys from the last war. And why? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2741.8799999999997s)]
*  And this is where our conversation comes full circle. Because America, following, as your other [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2748.12s)]
*  guest here said, following Netanyahu's advice and the neoconservatives working for him, lying us into [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2755.08s)]
*  war with Iraq, they empowered Iran and put the Iraqi Shiite super majority in power in Baghdad. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2760.12s)]
*  So then they panicked and they launched what the Bush administration called the redirection. That's [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2766.7599999999998s)]
*  it. Now we have to tilt back toward the Sunnis. If we put Iran up two pegs, the Shiites up two pegs [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2771.56s)]
*  in Baghdad, then we have to take them down a peg in Syria. And that means getting rid of Bashar al-Assad. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2777.56s)]
*  And as we discussed the last time I was on your show debating Wesley Clark, Piers, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2783.64s)]
*  that means, as we see right now, just as happened two months ago, finally, Al-Qaeda in Iraq in Syria, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2787.24s)]
*  led by Mohammed al-Julani, has just seized power in Damascus and taken over the country. And it was [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2793.24s)]
*  USAID up to that in their eyeballs the whole time. Why? Because they're making up for the disaster of [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2798.3599999999997s)]
*  doing what Netanyahu had recommended the time before that. OK. Michael, just to bring it back to [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2804.68s)]
*  USAID, USA, whatever you want to call it. It seems to me there ought to be broad agreement. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2811.96s)]
*  A lot of these examples are ludicrous. And it's probably a shock to the American people that their [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2817.48s)]
*  money is being wasted in this absurd manner. But there are also legitimate concerns. This is a [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2822.84s)]
*  massive agency. A lot of what it does is not absurd. They do help a lot of countries in a very [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2829.08s)]
*  meaningful, constructive way from everything I've read about it. You know, this sort of slam dunk [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2835.16s)]
*  thing that Elon is carrying out at the moment at Trump's behest, where he just shuts down an agency, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2839.72s)]
*  for example. What do you feel? Do you feel comfortable about that? There have been good [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2845.56s)]
*  programs as part of USAID. The one that's usually cited is PEPFAR, which is the President's Emergency [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2851.7999999999997s)]
*  Plan for AIDS Relief, started under George Bush in 2003. The problem is Democrats, notably Joe Biden, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2856.2799999999997s)]
*  have politicized and made toxic even those programs that have been very good. So Joe Biden, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2864.12s)]
*  by tying all US foreign aid to the promotion of abortion and radical LGBT LMNOP ideology, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2870.52s)]
*  has made even a great program like PEPFAR quite toxic. And so Elon said, we were initially going [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2877.08s)]
*  to go in there and get the worm out of the apple, but unfortunately we found out it's all worms. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2883.3199999999997s)]
*  And so USAID in principle can be a good thing. I don't want American conservatives to draw [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2888.12s)]
*  the wrong conclusion from this. Yes, $70,000 on a trans opera in Kirkmenistan or whatever is ridiculous, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2894.92s)]
*  but it's broadly speaking good for the United States to project soft power. The problem is [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2901.96s)]
*  not that America is projecting imperial power, as it's sometimes called. The problem is what we are [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2909.8799999999997s)]
*  projecting. If we were projecting truth, justice, and the American way, if we were projecting law [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2915.32s)]
*  and order and virtue and all this good stuff, great, sign me up, man. But if what we're actually [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2921.1600000000003s)]
*  projecting is transing little kids and making aid contingent on countries that don't want any of [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2926.76s)]
*  this woke nonsense, accepting these ideas, well, then I don't want to project that kind of influence. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2933.48s)]
*  It's less about the procedural norm of USAID and more about the substance of good. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2938.84s)]
*  Yeah, we've got about just a few minutes left. I want to move on because I want to get this in [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2942.92s)]
*  before we finish and we're running out of time. Just one thing that is super important that I [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2948.84s)]
*  think is missed in this presentation. Very quickly, Emil. No, it's about Elon Musk himself being [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2953.8s)]
*  unelected, having incredible conflicts of interest, and the fact that he's not the person who should [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2960.04s)]
*  be doing this, going in there and slashing programs on his own. He has not been confirmed by the Senate. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2964.92s)]
*  He's in battle with all the government entities that are trying to regulate the businesses that [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2970.04s)]
*  he has. And that's a clear conflict of interest that I think is deeply problematic. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2974.04s)]
*  Omar, this is well established precedent. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2977.32s)]
*  If he starts giving himself this president for a contract, that's one thing. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2979.72s)]
*  All right, well, Scott, just cancel that out quickly. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2983.56s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to say, yeah, no, if he starts giving himself contracts to launch rockets and [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2986.44s)]
*  make nuclear missiles or something, obviously that's a huge conflict of interest. But just because [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2990.92s)]
*  he's tough enough to go in there with an axe and ruin these government employees' lives, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=2995.16s)]
*  he should be absolutely celebrated for that. And by the way, I forgot my footnote earlier. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3000.1200000000003s)]
*  It's Arnon Soffer, and people can read what he wrote there for Sharon at my website, scothorton.org. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3003.7200000000003s)]
*  OK, I want to turn to this. Hang on, guys. I want to leave it there because I really want to get [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3009.56s)]
*  this in before we have to let you go. And it's this. I interviewed President Zelensky on Monday, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3014.2000000000003s)]
*  and it aired last night. And he said this about if Ukraine, as part of any settlement with Russia, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3019.6400000000003s)]
*  which remains to be seen if Putin will go for any of this, given that they're clearly beginning to [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3026.92s)]
*  win this war, Russia, on the battlefield. But whether he accepts, I think, Zelensky now, that [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3031.48s)]
*  getting full NATO membership is highly unlikely. So he was trying to paint for me a picture of [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3039.08s)]
*  what would be acceptable to him. And it was enough security guarantees led by NATO where he'd have [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3044.12s)]
*  enough manpower, he lost a lot of troops, obviously, enough manpower and military hardware [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3050.44s)]
*  to deter Putin from any further attacks. And he said, and you can include the nuclear weapons [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3055.88s)]
*  that we had to give up, obviously, when back in the mid-90s. So let's listen to what he said. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3061.56s)]
*  What will be defending us against this evil for this whole time on this whole path? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3067.48s)]
*  Which support package, which missiles? Will we be given nuclear weapons? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3077.4s)]
*  Then let them give us nuclear weapons. Will they give us the missiles in the quantities that we can [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3085.96s)]
*  stop Russia? And I'm not sure of that, but I think it would help. Otherwise, what missiles can stop [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3094.28s)]
*  Russia's nuclear missiles? That is a rhetorical question. So let's do the following way. Give us [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3102.12s)]
*  back nuclear arms. Michael, what was interesting about this is that the Kremlin's come out, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3109.4s)]
*  their spokesman, Dmitry Peskov today, dismissing that suggestion, said in principle, such statements [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3118.28s)]
*  and remarks border on madness. Now, some people might say, well, hang on a second. Ukraine, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3123.96s)]
*  when the Soviet Union broke up and it went independent in the mid-90s, there were nuclear [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3130.92s)]
*  weapons in Ukraine, which would then return to Russia as part of an agreement led by America. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3135.72s)]
*  So Ukraine, as it went independent, voluntarily agreed to give up its weapons. And there was a [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3141.8799999999997s)]
*  big agreement in place to offer its security guarantees, which Putin then ignored with impunity. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3147.9599999999996s)]
*  It's got a point, hasn't it? I mean, if you've got a country like Russia with 6,000 nuclear weapons, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3154.52s)]
*  would he have invaded Putin nearly three years ago if he knew that Ukraine still had nuclear [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3159.96s)]
*  defenses? And if they're not going to give Ukraine, NATO, full membership, is he mad, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3165.6400000000003s)]
*  as the Russians are saying, is he mad that they should have at least one weapon [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3174.04s)]
*  which matches the firepower that the enemy has to stop Putin to actually deter him from attacking [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3178.36s)]
*  again? Because look at the history. He attacked and took over Crimea, and he left it a few years, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3184.52s)]
*  and he attacked again. He's taken more land. Call me cynical. I'm very cynical about Putin. I think [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3189.08s)]
*  he's going to carry on as much as he can unless there is a genuine deterrent. So what do you think, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3195.64s)]
*  Michael, of Zelensky's plea? It's a perfectly reasonable plea. If I were him, I would make it, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3200.2s)]
*  and I don't find any logical errors in it. And also, we're not going to give him nuclear weapons. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3207.4s)]
*  So sorry, buddy. The fact that Ukraine lost its nuclear weapons is one of the reasons that Russia [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3211.72s)]
*  was able to invade. There's no question about it. But again, I suppose the theme of our [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3217.96s)]
*  conversations on all of these topics today has been the matter of negotiating and talking past [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3222.68s)]
*  the sale. I suspect that Vladimir Zelensky is not a dummy and doesn't really believe that Donald [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3226.84s)]
*  Trump is going to give him a nuke. However, that's probably a tactic to try to get more conventional [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3232.28s)]
*  weapons in the fight against Russia. But there's no question about it. They had them. They were a [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3237.4s)]
*  great deterrent to Russia, but nobody wants to see a nuclear war pop off in Eastern Europe. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3245.4s)]
*  Yeah, Scott, what do you think? I mean, it's complicated by the fact that, obviously, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3250.6800000000003s)]
*  they were Russian weapons that happened to then be in independent Ukraine. And that's why this [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3255.2400000000002s)]
*  deal got done. It's probably too simplistic to say Ukraine had a nuclear deterrent against Putin. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3261.56s)]
*  They had Russia-owned weapons, which then got returned to Russia. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3267.64s)]
*  Yeah, they were Soviet nukes, and the Ukrainians never had the codes for them. And they were on [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3272.28s)]
*  three-stage, or I believe mostly all of them were married to three-stage rockets that are pretty [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3276.52s)]
*  hard to target at Russia next door and all of that. So they were essentially useless to the Ukrainians [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3281.32s)]
*  at the time that they gave them up anyway. But I would say, look, there's a lot of question begging [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3286.12s)]
*  and circular argument from the hawks on this stuff. And it's understandable what you say, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3290.44s)]
*  obviously, if Ukraine was bristling with H bombs, then it would have been more difficult for Russia [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3294.04s)]
*  to invade. But it's a chicken and an egg kind of assuming the conclusion sort of a thing a lot [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3298.04s)]
*  of the times, because what did happen, in fact, was that Russia was provoked by America arming [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3303.8s)]
*  up Ukraine to deter Russia. And that was what the Americans said that they were doing. And I believe [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3311.72s)]
*  them that that was what they were trying to do. And as the Rand Corporation said, you have to [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3317.16s)]
*  carefully calibrate how many weapons you pour in there so that it doesn't backfire. You have to [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3322.04s)]
*  have just the right amount. And I think I told you this before when I debated Wesley Clark on [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3327.08s)]
*  your show here, Pierce, was that there's this great journalist for Yahoo News named Zach Dorfman. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3330.7599999999998s)]
*  And right at the start of the war, Zach Dorfman talked to CIA officers in Ukraine who were the [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3336.36s)]
*  ones in charge of receiving the American weapons and distributing them. And they told him that they [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3341.96s)]
*  had complained to the bosses to tell the politicians in the White House, stop this now, stop pouring in [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3347.7999999999997s)]
*  more weapons. You have miscalibrated the amount of weapons. What you're doing is you're not really [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3353.96s)]
*  giving Ukraine enough to deter Russia from attacking, but you're making them feel like [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3360.28s)]
*  they better do it now because it's going to be more difficult later. And I would also point out [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3365.2400000000002s)]
*  just real quick here that in this horrible, horrific war that's happened, the most that you [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3371.08s)]
*  could really accuse the Russians of being as ambitious as wanting possibly Kharkiv and Odessa. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3377.32s)]
*  So far they do not have Kharkiv and Odessa. And if they're brought to the table a couple of years [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3383.72s)]
*  ago, it wouldn't have even been a question. It very well could be settled now, but it is not at all [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3388.04s)]
*  in evidence, gentlemen, that Russia wants all of Ukraine and that after they're done losing the [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3393.16s)]
*  East and the South as they already have, that Russia will then pose a perpetual threat to invade [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3399.4s)]
*  and conquer the rest. It was truly, as I say in the book, not Kiev, it was Washington that started [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3405.3199999999997s)]
*  this war by putting Kiev in this situation as being a partial auxiliary of the American military [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3411.24s)]
*  through what they call military interoperability, making them essentially a de facto member of NATO, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3417.16s)]
*  but without the war guarantee. So people, the hawks say now, well, yeah, you should have given [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3422.6s)]
*  them the war guarantee. But the thing is if they had started to bring Ukraine into NATO, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3426.9199999999996s)]
*  Russia would have invaded sooner before the ink was dry on the page in order to absolutely prevent [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3431.08s)]
*  that from taking place. It was never an option. I mean, look, like I say, I'm very cynical. I think [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3436.9199999999996s)]
*  Putin would love to get his hands on all of Ukraine personally and then move on to other [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3441.16s)]
*  countries. But we'll see how history will record all this. Omod, just quickly, I mean, your response [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3445.48s)]
*  to Zelensky saying, look, I need enough defence to act as a genuine deterrent, not something that [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3451.16s)]
*  Putin can just ignore. Yeah, I mean, we need fewer nuclear weapons in the world and not more. We [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3458.04s)]
*  already are living in an incredibly dangerous situation. We're having as many nuclear weapons [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3465.48s)]
*  out there as we have. And of course, Donald Trump, the alleged foreign policy genius, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3469.64s)]
*  tore up the nuclear deal with Iran that made sure that Iran could not have nukes and is pursuing a [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3474.2s)]
*  belligerent strategy towards Iran. And Iran's nuclear program is advancing and progressing [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3479.0s)]
*  because of that. The world is becoming incredibly more dangerous. And I think this is a very, very [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3483.16s)]
*  serious issue that when we're looking at the prospects of the world ending, it's climate [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3487.7999999999997s)]
*  change and the prospect of nuclear war. Those are the two biggest risks. And we are really playing [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3493.0s)]
*  with fire if we continue down the path of saying that the way to maintain world peace is just to [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3497.48s)]
*  spread destructive weapons that could blow up the entire planet everywhere so that nobody would [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3501.64s)]
*  invade. We have to be more civilised than that. And we have to achieve a level of seriousness about [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3505.8s)]
*  preserving this planet for future generations that leads us down a very, very different path. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3511.88s)]
*  Okay. Vinny? Final word to you, Vinny? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3516.04s)]
*  With resolution and resolving conflict. Okay. Vinny? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3518.68s)]
*  Well, to say that Trump did all this stuff with Iran, let's not forget, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3521.48s)]
*  Joe Biden's administration released what? $6 billion to Iran. But that's a whole different [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3525.32s)]
*  conversation. Piers, I'm anti-Zelensky, 1000% having a nuclear weapon. I mean, there was [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3529.88s)]
*  reports that some of those tactical nudes that we were hearing that might have been smuggled in [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3535.32s)]
*  through Mexico into our country. I think it's a horrible, horrible idea. But let's go back. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3539.56s)]
*  Just like I said with October 7th, finding out how we got here, how do we get there? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3544.36s)]
*  Joe Biden invited basically a small incursion. He said, I wouldn't do anything if Russia did a small, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3548.1200000000003s)]
*  tiny incursion in Ukraine. And we are where we are. And that place, let's be honest, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3554.84s)]
*  that place has been a money laundering spot for the past freaking four years and years beyond that. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3559.1600000000003s)]
*  Piers Zelensky, we know who Zelensky is. He's a freaking puppet. He just came out the other day, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3564.6800000000003s)]
*  Piers, what did he say? There's billions of dollars that was promised to me that are gone missing. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3568.6800000000003s)]
*  I think cutting them off completely. Well, he explained that yesterday. To be fair to him, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3574.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, to Vinny, I don't agree with you about Zelensky, but to be fair to him, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3578.1200000000003s)]
*  he explained all that in my interview, that what he meant was he keeps reading that he's been given [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3581.3199999999997s)]
*  200 billion dollars, but he's only received, actually received 77 billion dollars worth of [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3585.96s)]
*  commitment, which is part in terms of arms and they have to get those from America, obviously, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3594.2s)]
*  and part for other stuff on the ground they need it for. But they've certainly not had hundreds of [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3598.8399999999997s)]
*  billions, as many Americans seem to think that they have, which is something he wanted to clarify, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3604.92s)]
*  because he says, look, we just not had nearly enough and people might say they don't deserve [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3609.48s)]
*  it and they shouldn't have it and they were provoked and so on, but they've been at war now [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3614.2s)]
*  for three years at a horrendous death toll on their civilians, on their infrastructure and so on. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3617.2400000000002s)]
*  And in the end, it just seems to me quite straightforward. Do we want a Russian dictator [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3624.04s)]
*  running around invading European countries? Yes or no? We didn't with Hitler when he tried it [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3629.48s)]
*  from the German side. We repelled him and we stopped it and we killed off Nazism. I think that [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3636.04s)]
*  Putin, nothing would surprise me, honestly, but I'm very cynical about him in a way that [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3642.04s)]
*  a lot of people, bizarrely to me, seem less cynical about him. I wouldn't trust a word he says. Anyway, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3646.84s)]
*  I'll leave you on that bombshell. It's been a great panel. Thank you all very much indeed. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3653.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, for more on President Trump's plans for Gaza, I'm joined by two people who are no strangers to [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3657.72s)]
*  Uncensored, Alan Dershowitz, the former professor at Harvard Law School and professor emeritus [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3661.72s)]
*  and author of eight books, and I'll be speaking to Dr Mustafa Barghouti, the secretary general [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3666.2799999999997s)]
*  of the Palestinian National Initiative. Well, let me start with you, Alan, if I may. On the face of [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3671.16s)]
*  it, as with many of Trump's statements, everyone goes completely nuts. They all think it's completely [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3677.7999999999997s)]
*  insane and it follows a familiar pattern and then you find out that what he really means turns out [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3684.12s)]
*  to be something rather more diluted and palatable because he's a traitor at heart. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3689.32s)]
*  What is your reaction to this, though? It's so dramatic. It stunned the world, but is there [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3694.2000000000003s)]
*  merit or method to the apparent madness? Well, it certainly shocked me and surprised me. I've been [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3701.48s)]
*  in this area for years and years and years. This is the first bold, new, out-of-the-box thinking [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3708.36s)]
*  about Gaza, and it shouldn't be rejected out of hand. It's reminiscent of Churchill and Roosevelt's [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3714.84s)]
*  view at the end of the Second World War to transfer millions of Sudeten Germans out of their land they [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3722.1200000000003s)]
*  had lived in for hundreds of years in Czechoslovakia and move them back to Germany, or the thinking of [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3730.2000000000003s)]
*  Nehru and others when England gave up India and Pakistan, transfers of populations against the [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3736.44s)]

*  Sudeten Germans, and it produced an enduring peace, not perfect peace in either cases, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3749.88s)]
*  and with high costs and high prices. Or consider the decision of Russia to take over Konigsberg, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3755.4s)]
*  an old German city, and to remove all the German residents of Konigsberg and to repopulate the city, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3762.92s)]
*  rename it Kaliningrad, repopulate it with Russians, and annex it to the Soviet Union. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3769.32s)]
*  There's precedent for this. I think it's an idea that's worth thinking about, and it's variations. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3776.36s)]
*  There are so many possible variations. For example, you can do it piece by piece. You can clear out [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3783.88s)]
*  an area of Gaza, remove the population, clean it up, get rid of all the tunnels, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3789.8s)]
*  then repopulate it with Gazans who would agree that they are not going to [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3796.28s)]
*  engage in terrorism, they're not going to join Hamas. Look, the alternatives that all the critics [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3802.28s)]
*  have been presenting are not viable. It's just doing the same thing over and over again. That's [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3808.84s)]
*  Albert Einstein's definition of insanity. We need new thinking. We need fresh thinking. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3814.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm happy that President Trump came up with this idea. Now let's think about it. Now let's [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3819.88s)]
*  deconstruct it. Now let's go step by step. Let's see if we can accept parts of it, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3824.92s)]
*  accept other parts of it. Let's see whether or not we can do something different in Gaza [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3830.44s)]
*  rather than return it to the status quo. Already the heads of Hamas said they're going to do [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3835.96s)]
*  October 7th again and again and again. Remember, too, people say it's against international law [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3840.44s)]
*  to move populations. Well, was it against the international law for Churchill to do it, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3845.7200000000003s)]
*  or Roosevelt to do it? Are the same people complaining when the Hamas charter calls for [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3850.6s)]
*  the transfer of populations out of Israel and Jews being eliminated from the river to the sea? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3855.64s)]
*  We have to have bold new thinking. We shouldn't use cliches like ethnic cleansing and transfer [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3862.52s)]
*  of population. We should think hard about what the realistic options are. None of them are cost [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3867.72s)]
*  free. All of them will involve suffering. The question is, what's more important, place or [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3873.08s)]
*  peace? What's more important, geography or trying to bring about a resolution to an age old problem? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3878.6s)]
*  Okay, so Ahi, here's what I would say to you, though. You say it's not about ethnic cleansing [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3884.92s)]
*  or any of these things, but if it was the other way around, Alan, and be honest, if the big idea [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3890.6s)]
*  from the President of the United States was actually we know how to resolve this, we're going [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3895.24s)]
*  to move everyone in Israel somewhere else, right? Just hypothetically, we're going to move the [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3899.08s)]
*  millions of Israelis. They're going to move and the Palestinians will get to, you know, have that [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3905.24s)]
*  land or they'll share it, that land or whatever that they're moving from. You would lead the call [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3910.12s)]
*  of this is ethnic cleansing. You would say this is unbelievable, shocking, appalling and should [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3915.7999999999997s)]
*  never be contemplated. And I think if you're honest, you would admit that. So I want you to [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3922.6s)]
*  put yourself in the, well, you cannot answer the question yourself, but I assume you would say that. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3927.16s)]
*  But if you're a Palestinian, you don't see this as the great rosy future. You see this as you being [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3932.52s)]
*  kicked out of your land and it confirms the very fears you've been expressing about members of the [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3938.52s)]
*  cabinet like Smodrich and Ben-Gavir and so on, who have been talking them this way for quite some time, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3945.2400000000002s)]
*  that they just wanted to get rid of the Palestinians. Look, this wasn't an idea that came, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3950.44s)]
*  that Smodrich or Ben-Gavir or even Natanio came up with, an idea that the current administration [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3956.28s)]
*  came up with. Remember too, that all the movements of Palestinians resulted from Palestinians [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3963.08s)]
*  attacking Israel in 1948. They produced the Nakba. Palestinians would have been allowed to stay in [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3968.6s)]
*  Israel, hundreds of thousands of them, if they hadn't attacked Israel. And so, no, Israel is an [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3974.84s)]
*  established state. It didn't start the October 7th war. When you start a war, the way Germany [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3980.68s)]
*  started with Czechoslovakia, your civilians pay a price. And if the price can result in real peace, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3987.7999999999997s)]
*  if the people of Gaza can be returned, and I don't want to see the people, the Palestinians of Gaza [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=3997.56s)]
*  removed forever. I want to see them returned to a stable community with beautiful homes, with no [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4002.44s)]
*  tunnels, with no rockets, with demilitarisation. That would be a first step to a two-state solution. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4007.72s)]
*  Remember, I'm a strong supporter of the two-state solution. But that's not what Donald Trump said, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4014.12s)]
*  is it? But Alan, just to jump in there, if that's what Donald Trump had said, then fine. But actually [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4018.2s)]
*  what Donald Trump, when he was asked directly about what would happen with Palestinians, he said, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4023.0s)]
*  well, some of them could come back. But his implication was very clear, that most of them [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4028.3599999999997s)]
*  would not. That most of them would literally move to Jordan and Egypt, both of whom their leaders [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4032.84s)]
*  have said, we're not doing this. And the general reaction across the Arab world is one of absolutely [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4039.32s)]
*  not happening in a million years. So I just think it's, you know, I get the boldness, I get the [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4045.4s)]
*  vision, I get if you're an Israeli, this makes perfect sense and it's great. But if you're a [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4050.84s)]
*  Palestinian, you're like, hang on, so we're getting kicked out, most of us forever, from what they see [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4055.0s)]
*  as their homeland. You know, and again, I just ask you, if it was the other way around, how would [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4062.52s)]
*  you feel? Well, first, it wouldn't be the other way around because Israel has lived in peace, it [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4066.44s)]
*  has never attacked its enemies, it has always been the recipient of attacks. It's only the Palestinians [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4072.2s)]
*  who say from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free of Jews. It's they're the ones who want [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4077.88s)]
*  ethnic cleansing. Israel's responding to it by saying, wait a minute, let's not do any ethnic [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4083.08s)]
*  cleansing, let's clear areas. This would be my idea and it's an idea I would propose to President [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4087.88s)]
*  Trump if he asked me and he has asked me from time to time about my ideas. Clear certain areas, say [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4093.6400000000003s)]
*  the south, the Ra'afah area, clear it, move all the Palestinians out, give them tremendous [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4098.76s)]
*  compensation packages, hundreds of thousands of dollars, give them beautiful homes in Jordan and [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4105.0s)]
*  Syria and Lebanon and Egypt, let them decide. And if they decide to stay, well, that would be fine. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4110.6s)]
*  If they decide to come back, then they can come back if they can clear vetting, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4116.6s)]
*  if they can demonstrate that they're not Hamas terrorists, if they can demonstrate that they [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4120.360000000001s)]
*  do not want to take up arms, that they are not in favor of ethnic cleansing of Jews, let them come [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4124.84s)]
*  back region by region to an area that has no tunnels, that tunnels can't be built, create a [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4130.120000000001s)]
*  situation with underground wires and everything to prevent the building of tunnels. Let's rebuild [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4137.320000000001s)]
*  Gaza. It literally can be Singapore in the Mediterranean. Remember Israel left Gaza in 2005. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4142.92s)]
*  They left it completely until Hamas took over and they could have built a beautiful seaport. I have [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4148.84s)]
*  been in Gaza, I've eaten in Cognouness, I've eaten in Gaza City. It could be magnificent and I think [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4155.4s)]
*  Trump maybe naively believes that that could happen again, but if it could happen piece by piece [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4161.0s)]
*  with a right to return, but a right to return if you're not a terrorist from Hamas and if you're [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4168.68s)]
*  prepared to lay down arms and live in peace with Israel, 10 years from now we could finally have [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4174.200000000001s)]
*  a solution that would then enable Israel to move toward a two-state solution with the West Bank, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4180.84s)]
*  relationships with Saudi Arabia. It's the beginning. Let's not just reject it by using [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4187.0s)]
*  terms like ethnic cleansing because those terms have been used in Sudetenland and Sudetenland was [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4193.64s)]
*  a success. The official definition of ethnic cleansing is the forced removal or killing of [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4200.200000000001s)]
*  a population ethnic group or religious group against their will and it's pretty clear from [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4208.4400000000005s)]
*  the immediate reaction from Palestinians that this would be against their will, therefore the [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4213.4800000000005s)]
*  forced removal of a population is by the definition ethnic cleansing. It's not like [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4219.16s)]
*  people are exaggerating. That's exactly what it would be if it's against their wishes. No, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4226.2s)]
*  that's not true. International law is based on precedent and I don't think anybody has accused [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4229.96s)]
*  Churchill and Roosevelt of ethnic cleansing when they moved involuntarily millions of ethnic Germans [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4235.96s)]
*  who were causing a problem. They were the beginning of the Second World War and the problem has been [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4243.0s)]
*  solved. International law is flexible. Peace is more important than geography so let's not get [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4247.8s)]
*  caught up in technical definitions that are anachronistic and that have never been applied. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4255.0s)]
*  India, Pakistan, we had millions of people displaced against their will. In Konigsberg, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4260.76s)]
*  every single German was replaced. Was there objection to that? No, that was Churchill's [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4266.92s)]
*  accepted it. No, that Roosevelt accepted it. These were accepted by international law of the [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4272.4400000000005s)]
*  United States. Let's do what's best for the Palestinians. Let's do what's best for the [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4276.76s)]
*  Israelis. Let's do what's best with peace. Let's not just reject the idea by putting a label on it. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4281.320000000001s)]
*  It is not in violation of the precedents of international law. It's been done in the past [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4287.16s)]
*  with great success and the best criteria for something under law is did it work? And it [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4292.68s)]
*  worked in Sudetenland. It worked in Pakistan and it is still working in Konigsberg. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4298.92s)]
*  Alan Dershowitz, thank you very much indeed. I appreciate it. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4304.44s)]
*  Well let me bring in Dr Mustafa Barghouti who was listening to that. Dr Barghouti, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4310.759999999999s)]
*  your response to Alan Dershowitz there. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4314.5199999999995s)]
*  Well I'm not surprised at all about everything that Mr Dershowitz said. He is being a very well [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4318.44s)]
*  known lawyer of murderers and very bad record of even defending Epstein but more than that... [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4325.24s)]
*  Hang on, hang on. Don't interrupt me. I'm sorry if you say something ridiculous I'm going to [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4335.719999999999s)]
*  interrupt you. The fact he's a lawyer who's represented people who may have committed crimes [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4343.639999999999s)]
*  he's allowed to represent anyone and that's what lawyers do. Why would that be a stick to [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4350.2s)]
*  beat him with? Well he has a very bad record of even being a lawyer but I will not waste the time [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4354.76s)]
*  of the program on that and I'm not saying ridiculous things. Please respect me. What he said now, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4360.92s)]
*  he just lied several times. He claimed that Israel never attacked and never initiated a war. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4369.0s)]
*  They initiated the war in 1948 by attacking Palestinian communities. They erased to the [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4376.12s)]
*  ground 521 Palestinian communities and destroyed them. They ethnically cleansed 70 percent of the [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4381.96s)]
*  Palestinian people. In 1956 they and France and Britain attacked Egypt. They initiated the attack. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4389.24s)]
*  In 1967 Israel initiated an attack on Jordan, Egypt and Syria and occupied the occupied territories [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4397.72s)]
*  which is now a problem we are living with. But let me go back to the question of what Mr Trump has [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4404.84s)]
*  proposed. Trump is not only giving making a very destructive proposal. He's actually issuing a [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4410.68s)]
*  criminal proposal. What he is advocating is the violation of international law by ethnically [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4419.96s)]
*  cleansing Palestinian people in Gaza. That's what he is proposing. Sourcing people out of their [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4428.360000000001s)]
*  homeland. What would Mr Trump think if I suggest that all people in New York should be removed to [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4434.04s)]
*  Afghanistan or should be removed to Mexico? Of course they will say this is crazy. How could [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4440.44s)]
*  you speak about that? What was Mr Dervovich would say as you have said if the plan was to displace [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4447.799999999999s)]
*  Jewish people from Israel? After all we've been living here for thousands of years. Long time [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4455.4s)]
*  before the Israelis who exist now in Israel lived here. So this is very dangerous approach. It lacks [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4461.4s)]
*  respect of international law. It actually shows a great amount of ignorance to the history of the [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4469.72s)]
*  Palestinian people. To the resilience of the Palestinian people and a great amount of ignorance [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4476.68s)]
*  of the geopolitical facts of the area. And it will not work. Of course it will not work. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4482.280000000001s)]
*  How could Mr Dervish compare the situation now with what happened during the second world war? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4488.52s)]
*  We have now the United Nations. We have something called the international law. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4494.360000000001s)]
*  That's exactly what Mr Biden told Netanyahu when he spoke about the cleansing of Palestinians. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4498.92s)]
*  So let me ask you this. Donald Trump said he's thought about this for a while because [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4505.400000000001s)]
*  he's not hearing any good idea to resolve this. It's been going on for more than seven decades. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4508.84s)]
*  Why? That is a very good idea. Well hang on. I'm going to ask you. Let me ask you a question. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4515.56s)]
*  Nobody tried it. Let me ask you a question. With respect. You want respect for you. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4519.96s)]
*  Show me the same respect. So my question for you is what is your solution? If it's not this, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4526.04s)]
*  fine. What is your solution? Very simple. End the Israeli illegal occupation of the West Bank, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4532.6s)]
*  Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. Allow Palestinian refugees to have the right, their right of return. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4540.36s)]
*  And allow Palestinians to have a state of their own, independent state, sovereign state, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4547.64s)]
*  without Israeli illegal settlements that have been built on Palestinian land illegally. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4552.92s)]
*  And coexist and live in peace. This is the thing that was never tried because Israel never accepted [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4558.6s)]
*  to end its occupation. And who would run the Palestinian side? The Palestinians will elect [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4566.6s)]
*  their leaders through a democratic process like people do in any other country, including in [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4573.56s)]
*  Israel. If they don't want two-state solution, I have a better solution. One democratic state [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4579.320000000001s)]
*  with equal rights for everybody. It's either two states or one democratic state. Would you throw up [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4585.4800000000005s)]
*  state? Look, I agree with you. I think there should be a two-state solution. No, one moment. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4591.72s)]
*  If they don't want two states, they don't want one democratic state, they want exactly what Trump is [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4596.84s)]
*  proposing. Ethnic cleansing. And of course, Trump would not have proposed that if he didn't consult [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4602.28s)]
*  with Netanyahu beforehand. But let me ask you, would you in this proposal that you've just outlined, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4609.08s)]
*  would you allow Hamas, for example, to be part of any government going forward if that was the will [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4614.92s)]
*  of the people of Gaza? If there is peace, Hamas will be willing to live peacefully with everybody [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4620.5199999999995s)]
*  else. I know that very well. Why would you say that? At that point, you lose me. Hamas did not exist 30 years ago. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4627.24s)]
*  Hamas made their intentions very clear on October 7. They are a terrorist organisation who wage an [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4634.599999999999s)]
*  act of horrendous, heinous terror. More than that, they came out immediately afterwards through their [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4642.679999999999s)]
*  official spokesman and said, we're going to keep doing this again and again and again. They are [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4647.88s)]
*  wedded to an ideology of destroying everything that Israel stands for. Why if you're Israel? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4652.84s)]
*  That's not true. Well, they've said it. I mean, you haven't got to believe me. They've said it [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4658.2s)]
*  themselves. But the idea that you could have Hamas after what they've done, that you could have them [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4662.92s)]
*  as part of a government, would be a non-starter for Israel and for America. First of all, Israel said [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4668.28s)]
*  they do not accept Hamas and they don't accept the Palestinian Authority and they don't accept [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4673.96s)]
*  an independent national coalition government. They don't accept any Palestinian. They dehumanise Hamas [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4678.92s)]
*  to dehumanise all Palestinians. And I don't accept your description of them as terrorists, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4686.28s)]
*  because we could go back in history and remember that George Washington was accused of being [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4691.96s)]
*  terrorist by the British because he fought for independence. We could remember that Nelson Mandela [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4697.4s)]
*  was accused of being terrorist and put on the American terrorist list of the Congress for [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4702.92s)]
*  a very long time, even after he became president and every American president was trying to have [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4708.68s)]
*  a photo opportunity with him. Let's remember history here. Look, Palestinians are struggling [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4713.72s)]
*  for their freedom. The Palestinians want to have peace, just peace, but now insisting or imposing [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4719.08s)]
*  on us ethnic cleansing, this is beyond any kind of understanding. And let me tell you that what [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4728.52s)]
*  Netanyahu failed to achieve in his venus side act in Gaza of ethnic cleansing of Palestinians will [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4735.24s)]
*  not be achieved by Trump, by his threats and what he's proposing. No Arab country will participate [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4742.5199999999995s)]
*  in this. Egypt rejected it. Saudi Arabia made very strong statement. Jordan rejected it because, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4751.32s)]
*  not only because their peoples will never allow their participation in a crime of ethnic cleansing [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4758.2s)]
*  of Palestinians, but also because they know Jordan will not exist anymore if that happens. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4764.92s)]
*  Egypt will be affected because their national security will be affected. This is crazy. I don't [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4771.4s)]
*  know how the head of the biggest country in the world or the wealthiest country in the world, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4777.4s)]
*  the United States of America, could come up with suggestions that violate every international law [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4783.4s)]
*  and advocate a crime, a crime of ethnic cleansing. Okay, so let me put it back to you then. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4789.24s)]
*  Do you accept... Okay, hang on. Do you accept that what Hamas did on October the 7th [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4797.0s)]
*  was illegal, was a crime, was against international law? Do you accept that? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4803.16s)]
*  I think I told you many times on your programme, I don't have to repeat that, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4808.12s)]
*  7th of October was not the beginning, was not the cause, was a result of something. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4812.36s)]
*  No, no, no, was a result of something. So it wasn't a crime. The crime is this continuous occupation. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4817.48s)]
*  The crime is what we've been subjected to. That wasn't my question. My question was whether the [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4824.36s)]
*  attack on October the 7th... No, no, no, I understand where you are aiming. Ethnic cleansing. No, I'm [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4827.799999999999s)]
*  asking you. You're saying... Apartheid occupation. Yeah, but hang on. With respect, Dr Barghouti, [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4831.879999999999s)]
*  with respect, you've just laid out a reason that this can't be allowed to happen the way Trump wants [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4836.28s)]
*  because it would represent a crime of ethnic cleansing. Fine, many people would agree with you. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4841.16s)]
*  I'm simply saying to you, you seem perfectly content with the idea that Hamas may be part of [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4845.8s)]
*  a government going forward after the war. That would be a loathsome concept to many people around [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4851.56s)]
*  the world. You see them as a terrorist group. And if you're going to talk about international law being [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4857.88s)]
*  broken and crimes as being a reason to not do something, I think I'm perfectly entitled to ask [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4862.52s)]
*  you whether you view what they did, Hamas, on October the 7th as a crime. Because if you don't, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4868.12s)]
*  then it's very revealing about how you see them. The real terrorist here is the one that... [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4874.04s)]
*  And what's up with my question? Don't distract. Just give me a straight answer. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4880.12s)]
*  Give me a straight answer. The real terrorist here is Netanyahu. All right. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4883.72s)]
*  Accused by the International Criminal Court. Why can't you give me a straight answer? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4888.04s)]
*  And by the way, Hamas did not want to stay as in the government, if that's the problem. Hamas accepted [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4892.6s)]
*  what we signed in Beijing, which is the formation of national coalition government, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4899.88s)]
*  which will not have Hamas in it. They agreed with that. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4905.5599999999995s)]
*  You said you were happy to have them in the government. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4909.8s)]
*  They don't want to be in the government. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4911.32s)]
*  Right, but you said you would be happy for them to be in the government. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4913.08s)]
*  No, I didn't say that. I said I accept what they say. They say they are ready to accept [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4917.24s)]
*  national consensus government, but Netanyahu is not accepting neither Hamas nor Fatah. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4923.08s)]
*  I'm just going to ask you... All right. I'm just going to ask you... All right, but Dr. Bagouti, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4928.84s)]
*  given you raised the issue of international law, then I'm just going to ask you one more time. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4933.56s)]
*  You don't have to answer it. I'm going to ask you one more time. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4939.08s)]
*  Was what Hamas did on October the 7th a crime, yes or no? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4941.8s)]
*  What Hamas did on October 7th was a response and a reaction to terrible atrocities made by Israel... [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4945.96s)]
*  Was it a crime? [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4953.16s)]
*  Yes, 1948. I don't like anybody to be killed. I don't like any Palestinian... [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4953.88s)]
*  Was it a crime? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4960.36s)]
*  ...or Israeli or American child to be killed. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4961.08s)]
*  Was it a crime? [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4963.8s)]
*  But you have to tell me who is the war criminal... [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4964.36s)]
*  No, no, I'm doing the questions. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4966.68s)]
*  ...who killed 17... [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4967.72s)]
*  Was it a crime? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4968.52s)]
*  17... No, no, wait. 17,000 children... [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4969.08s)]
*  Why can't you say it was a crime? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4971.400000000001s)]
*  ...in Palestine? No, Mr. Pierce, you are following the same trend. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4972.92s)]
*  No, no, I'm asking you a very simple question. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4977.0s)]
*  You don't accept us, the Palestinians, as equal human beings. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4979.0s)]
*  Very simple question. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4980.12s)]
*  Why you don't accept us as equal human beings? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4981.08s)]
*  No, why can't you accept that what they did was a heinous crime? [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4983.24s)]
*  Why you don't say that Netanyahu is a criminal? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4986.2s)]
*  Did you ever in your shows ask anybody whether Netanyahu was a criminal by killing 17,000 children? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4989.32s)]
*  Yes, I've asked many guests that question. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4995.0s)]
*  You didn't say he was a war criminal. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4997.48s)]
*  I've actually had many, many people on the show who've called him a war criminal, right? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=4999.48s)]
*  But I'm asking you if Hamas committed a crime on October 7th. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5004.5199999999995s)]
*  Let's not dive... [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5008.12s)]
*  You're not going to divert the discussion from... [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5010.12s)]
*  You're not going to give me an answer, are you? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5012.04s)]
*  The main issue here is... [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5013.96s)]
*  No, no, that is an issue for me. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5015.4s)]
*  No, no, no, Trump is proposing a war crime called... [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5018.6s)]
*  So you're big on war crimes if it's Trump or Netanyahu, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5021.72s)]
*  but when it comes to your own side, Hamas, you're not interested. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5024.84s)]
*  Nothing in the world can justify a war crime... [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5029.4s)]
*  All right, so Donald Trump would be... [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5032.36s)]
*  ...against Palestinian people in Gaza. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5033.64s)]
*  So you're very anti-war crimes, right to the point that it's Hamas perpetrating one of the [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5034.5199999999995s)]
*  worst crimes in modern memory and at that point you don't want to call it a war crime. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5040.12s)]
*  You want to keep diverting the discussion because you're not comfortable with... [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5045.48s)]
*  You're the one who mentioned international law, not me. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5049.48s)]
*  I am proving to you constantly that what we are talking here is a war crime that nobody should... [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5051.96s)]
*  I'm giving you the chance to answer. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5057.8s)]
*  And nobody should be allowed to accept. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5059.24s)]
*  I respect you coming on the programme. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5062.36s)]
*  We've had many discussions about this. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5064.12s)]
*  Your singular failure, having raised the issue of international... [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5065.88s)]
*  No, hang on. Sorry, I'm going to finish what I'm saying. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5070.68s)]
*  Your failure, you're the one who raised the issue of international law. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5073.88s)]
*  You're the one who's accusing everybody else of war crimes and you will not call... [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5079.16s)]
*  ...a serious violation of international law. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5083.32s)]
*  Fine, you will not call Hamas a war crime. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5085.24s)]
*  As long as you don't accept us Palestinians as equal human beings to Jewish people, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5087.72s)]
*  to other people, you will never succeed. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5093.32s)]
*  Okay, but you know what? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5095.56s)]
*  You keep repeating the same accusations. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5096.2s)]
*  You don't regard the fact that so many Palestinians... [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5098.92s)]
*  No, I'm just not going to be... [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5102.2s)]
*  Honesty, honesty. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5103.24s)]
*  You don't regard the fact that at this moment while we are talking... [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5104.28s)]
*  I say this with great respect. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5107.16s)]
*  The Israeli army... [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5108.04s)]
*  Okay, you can keep talking or let me respond. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5109.24s)]
*  ...attacking to Karem and Jenin in the West Bank... [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5111.24s)]
*  Can I respond, please? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5113.24s)]
*  Hamas is not governing the West Bank. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5114.2s)]
*  Let me respond. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5115.72s)]
*  Why is Israel attacking the West Bank? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5116.28s)]
*  Can you stop talking? [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5117.24s)]
*  Let me respond. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5118.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5120.04s)]
*  Please. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5120.68s)]
*  I just want to say this. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5121.16s)]
*  With all due respect to you, and I mean that, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5122.52s)]
*  because I'd like you to keep coming back on the programme, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5125.4s)]
*  but when you refuse repeatedly, as you have done today, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5127.96s)]
*  to say that what Hamas did in October 7 was a crime, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5132.12s)]
*  I'm not going to take any lectures from you [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5135.0s)]
*  about anybody else who may have committed war crimes. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5137.4800000000005s)]
*  Why should I? [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5140.2s)]
*  Because you refuse to call one of the biggest war crimes [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5141.32s)]
*  of modern times what it is. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5143.72s)]
*  So, I'm afraid you're not a legitimate observer [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5145.16s)]
*  about war crimes because you don't think that [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5149.4800000000005s)]
*  what Hamas did was a war crime. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5151.4800000000005s)]
*  So why should we listen to you about anybody else [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5153.24s)]
*  that you think is committing war crimes? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5155.88s)]
*  Can you allow me to respond without interrupting me? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5157.0s)]
*  Well, I've got about a minute, so you've got a minute. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5160.12s)]
*  I do not accept any crime against any people, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5163.08s)]
*  especially civilian populations. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5167.32s)]
*  Was it a crime then? [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5168.68s)]
*  But listen to me. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5170.28s)]
*  Don't interrupt me. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5171.32s)]
*  Give me my minute. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5172.28s)]
*  Don't interrupt me. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5174.36s)]
*  But what you are doing, Mr. Pierce, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5175.96s)]
*  is maybe trying to defend the Israelis and the crimes... [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5178.44s)]
*  I haven't said a word about the Israelis. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5181.8s)]
*  I'm not saying a word about the Israelis. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5183.56s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5185.56s)]
*  ...keep interrupting me because you don't like the facts [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5186.44s)]
*  I am telling you. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5189.16s)]
*  No, I don't like the fact you won't call a war crime a war crime. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5190.12s)]
*  Let me say the reality. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5193.24s)]
*  You divert the attention from the real problem. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5194.839999999999s)]
*  No, I asked you a simple question. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5197.4s)]
*  The real problem is, the real problem is, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5198.5199999999995s)]
*  Netanyahu and Trump have got declared the worst kind of crime, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5201.639999999999s)]
*  which is ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people in Gaza. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5207.4s)]
*  They will not succeed because we're resilient... [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5210.839999999999s)]
*  You said that. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5213.0s)]
*  ...we're staying on our land... [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5213.639999999999s)]
*  I hear that message. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5215.48s)]
*  ...and nobody will cooperate with them in achieving this kind of... [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5215.96s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5218.36s)]
*  Listen, you've made that point very clearly. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5219.24s)]
*  A lot of people will agree with you. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5221.4s)]
*  I might even agree with you myself about a lot of what you just said. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5223.08s)]
*  However... [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5226.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5226.44s)]
*  However, you would do yourself a massive favour [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5226.92s)]
*  if you were just able to find it in yourself [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5229.88s)]
*  to call what Hamas did on October the 7th a crime, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5232.6s)]
*  because it was quite clearly, indisputably... [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5235.56s)]
*  I don't need to prove myself to anybody. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5237.64s)]
*  You choose not to. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5240.12s)]
*  You choose not to and viewers... [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5241.24s)]
*  You chose not too many times. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5243.56s)]
*  I invited you too many times. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5245.8s)]
*  You've chosen not to. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5247.4s)]
*  Viewers can make their own minds up about that. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5248.6s)]
*  We do say the same thing because you don't answer the question. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5251.08s)]
*  Because you are biased to Israel. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5254.28s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5256.2s)]
*  You cannot be happy when it is clear that Israel is committing crimes [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5256.76s)]
*  and when you are not happy when it is proven that... [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5261.0s)]
*  Actually, I've called them out repeatedly in the last few months, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5263.96s)]
*  and as you probably know. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5266.92s)]
*  Anyway, we've got to leave you there. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5268.76s)]
*  Thank you very much, Dr. Muguti. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeXF_ohTzGw&t=5270.12s)]
