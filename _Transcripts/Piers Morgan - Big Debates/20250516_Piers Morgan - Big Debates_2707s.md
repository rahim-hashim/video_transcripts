Video Description: Gender roles are the subject of debate again after President Trump's advisor Margo Martin posted a picture of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt working while holding her baby - captioned "owning the libs".

And who better to discuss this, than Uncensored's resident advocate for traditional family values, Andrew Wilson and his wife and mother of his five children, Rachel Wilson?

They're joined by 'Emily Saves America' host Emily Wilson (no relation) - who recently made waves on TikTok with her post slamming 'trad wives' - and feminist blogger Clementine Ford, who certainly doesn't approve of the Wilsons' family values...

# ‘Piece Of SH*T!’ Andrew Wilson & His Wife Go To WAR With Feminist
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4)
*  Are you remotely apprehensive about unleashing Mrs. Wilson on the world like this? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=0.0s)]
*  No, but she is the only Wilson on the panel that I claim. I'm just just [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=5.72s)]
*  Anything you do. Did you put the bins out deep? You know the trash out. I mean, what do you do anything? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=11.08s)]
*  I don't do shit the piece of shit that you married to. Yeah [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=16.36s)]
*  He clearly doesn't respect you. Oh [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=19.24s)]
*  Clementine do all lives matter you do you know what all lives do matter? Thank you. Thank you [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=27.2s)]
*  Agree with Clementine. Do you hate men? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=38.2s)]
*  No, of course, I don't hate men. Why in 2020 did you tweet the corona virus isn't killing men fast enough? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=40.84s)]
*  Tweeted that in 2020 as a misguided tweet. I apologize to men again. Do it again. This is honestly [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=47.160000000000004s)]
*  One of the most absurd conversations I've ever had in my life [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=55.04s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt is ready out of the spotlight. That's her job after all of all what is worse [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=59.52s)]
*  She seems to be very good at it [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=65.16s)]
*  But a behind-the-scenes photograph posted by a colleague for Mother's Day in America has divided opinion even among the generally appreciative maga base [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=66.52s)]
*  16 million people saw this candy snap of leather in the White House seemingly holding a baby son in one arm while quotes [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=76.04s)]
*  Owning the libs closed quotes with the other a lot of those people applauded her as a super mom [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=82.56s)]
*  Many others criticized her for aping conservative family values while actually promoting a feminist myth about women who could have it all [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=87.56s)]
*  I might seem a bit harsh but the maga movement [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  She's part of has made big inroads in popular culture by promoting the return of traditional gender roles [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=97.28s)]
*  Here she is talking about masculinity back in 2023 [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=103.44s)]
*  man is someone who stands up for his family provides for those that he loves and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=107.92s)]
*  Contributes to his community a great example helping an elderly woman with her groceries helping a neighbor or putting others before yourself [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=113.52s)]
*  That's the definition of a man. I'm proud to have so many strong men in my life two older brothers a great father [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=120.82s)]
*  We love men. We need men and as women Jen, we should not be afraid to say that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=126.56s)]
*  Well, there's undeniably been a huge backlash to the whole era of demoralizing all men as [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=131.68s)]
*  Miniature Harvey Weinsteins with ambitions that are wickedly patriarchal [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  Coincidentally, you can read about how that's going on in my upcoming new book woke is dead [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=142.2s)]
*  It's ever been a better time for a book called woke is dead [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=146.68s)]
*  But where does the Renaissance of masculine men leave the women? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=150.04s)]
*  We thought it was a very good idea [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  Andrew Wilson was extolling the virtues of a more limited female role in a previous debate on uncensored when a shocked Emily Austin said this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=155.0s)]
*  Are you married? How do you make a married with many children? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=163.44s)]
*  You married with children. Oh, she's she's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm 23. I'm a boss lady girl. It's driving you crazy [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=171.16s)]
*  Working just pointing out for the right guy. The only thing you have you have no arguments. You just try to assault me personally [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=176.06s)]
*  Or Andrew Wilson's apparently ecstatic wife Rachel got in touch on X and told me she'd like to participate in our next debate [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=183.45999999999998s)]
*  And so she will she'll be joining us alongside an all-new panel of boss lady girls [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=191.18s)]
*  We're joining me now is the host of crucible Andrew Wilson Andrew's wife and author of occult feminism the secret history of women's liberation [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=198.73999999999998s)]
*  Rachel Wilson Emily Wilson [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=206.22s)]
*  No relation from Emily saves America and the feminist writer and author of I don't the case against marriage [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=208.26s)]
*  Clementine Ford to welcome to all of you [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=215.34s)]
*  Andrew great to have you back and uncensored. Are you remotely apprehensive about unleashing? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=218.98s)]
*  Mrs. Wilson on the world like this [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  No, but she is the only Wilson on the panel. They claim I'm just just [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=227.7s)]
*  Everyone seems to be other cool Wilson or Emily in this debate [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=234.62s)]
*  In this to header Rachel welcome to uncensored [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=237.78s)]
*  You reached out to me on X and very boldly said if you want to debate this properly get me on you're here [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=240.94s)]
*  How are you feeling about this? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=248.38s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me peers and thank you Andrew for unchaining me from the stove just long enough to appear today [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=250.94s)]
*  I got a day pass from the patriarchy [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=257.3s)]
*  benevolent [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=260.54s)]
*  So true. Yeah, so I'm very happy to be here people love to attack my husband [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=261.94s)]
*  Via me. I'm like the favorite way to do that. So I thought why not come on and and talk to people myself [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=267.46s)]
*  So look Rachel, let's just cut to the quick a lot of Andrew's critics [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  Not me a lot of his critics say that he's an obvious blatant misogynist [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=278.02s)]
*  He thinks all women should be you know, kept at home working away on the stove the housework [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=283.34s)]
*  Whatever it may be and know their place in life. You are actually married to him. You've been [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  Subject of mockery [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=295.24s)]
*  Inadvertently through the last debate we had about this for having him to endure being his wife [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=297.08s)]
*  What is it like being married to Andrew Wilson? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=302.12s)]
*  Well, it's pretty awesome. I mean he's hilarious. He's really smart guy [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=305.96s)]
*  He's very charming and most of all he's a great dad and a great husband and I share his worldview [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=310.3s)]
*  So I I would agree [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=316.68s)]
*  in fact [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=318.08s)]
*  I would say I would probably be the more bitter [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=318.68s)]
*  Misogynist out of the two of us if you really had to like pick one it would probably be me so really why do you say that? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  I just think that feminism has absolutely destroyed [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=327.76s)]
*  So much of what I hold dear in life and it's held me back more than it's helped me [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=331.88s)]
*  it's one of the reasons I started looking into the history and investigating it for myself and I think it's just created a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=336.4s)]
*  World where we now have a to-income economy and for women like me who do want to prioritize motherhood [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=344.2s)]
*  It makes it extremely hard. It just makes it financially difficult [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=350.28s)]
*  I faced tons of social pressure had my first daughter at 20 wanted to stay home [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=353.4s)]
*  Everyone around me even the so-called Christian conservative women told me it was a terrible idea [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  You can't do that. You have to bring the baby to daycare. You're gonna put yourself at risk [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=364.64s)]
*  You know that your husband's gonna hurt you you're gonna be abused if you don't have your own money in your own career [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think it's backwards [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=374.32s)]
*  I think it's the most inefficient stupid thing we've ever come up with and that in the future people look back at the feminist [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=376.16s)]
*  experiment as a goofy time in history where we tried this wild experiment that failed miserably and thank God it's over [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=383.36s)]
*  Wow, okay. Well Clementine Ford. I'm sure that you agree with every word of that day [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=391.16s)]
*  Firstly I'm very glad that you're happily married. It's great [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=397.88s)]
*  You know [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=401.24s)]
*  I know a lot of women are not happily married and they find it very difficult to leave [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=401.84s)]
*  Marriages particularly because of the financial strain. So good for you [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=405.12s)]
*  I do think that your historical understanding of feminism is extremely skewed [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=408.84s)]
*  the idea that somehow we have only created a two-income household because feminism has tried to destroy the world is [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=415.24s)]
*  Historically inaccurate in large part. Well, firstly, you're also talking about feminism from your very [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=421.52s)]
*  And when I say limited I'm not trying to insult you but the limited perspective of feminism in America and the understanding of the economy in America [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=428.68s)]
*  It's not taking into account the global reality of the fact that women have always worked [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=436.28s)]
*  Women still continue to work women for the most part produce the majority of the world's underpaid if you know drastically underpaid labor [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=441.96s)]
*  When you talk about a two-income household being somehow instituted by feminism [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=451.44s)]
*  You're failing to take into account that even in America, you know the kind of the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=456.4s)]
*  glamorization of this golden age of marriage in the 1950s to the early 1960s [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=462.67999999999995s)]
*  Which the marriage historian Stephanie Coutts calls the long decade this coincided with an increase in women in the workplace [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=466.76s)]
*  So it's not it's not as if there was this golden age where women went Matt went web married women. Sorry weren't working of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=474.84s)]
*  For a lot of that actually the labor that is required to support the middle class is [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=482.32s)]
*  Has always been relied on for or and disenfranchised women largely in America [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  Let me just let me just finish let me just finish speed things up a little bit and the the economy [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=494.67999999999995s)]
*  The downturn in the economy the the boom that happened after the Second World War was unsustainable [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=501.96s)]
*  It was a wonderful time between around 1940 to 1974 [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=506.67999999999995s)]
*  White working-class men in particular and then it began to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=511.12s)]
*  I have a question for you [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=514.12s)]
*  One of the reasons why women had to go into the workforce was because they have to help women [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=515.64s)]
*  Okay, I have a question for you Clementine. It's a very simple question. I think it'll be an interesting question to ask you [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=520.64s)]
*  What is a woman? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=526.32s)]
*  Yes, I'm not going down the path of debating trans women with you [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=529.32s)]
*  Trans women women women asked you what a woman. Okay, I'll tell you they know that because this is your tactic [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=533.44s)]
*  They know that because this is your tactic. This is what you do. What is a woman? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=538.88s)]
*  I'll tell you I'll tell you I'll tell you what a woman is a [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=544.44s)]
*  Woman is someone who has at least at one point in her life [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=548.0400000000001s)]
*  felt scared of a man [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=552.48s)]
*  Sorry, so [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=555.0400000000001s)]
*  So me any man who's ever felt afraid of another man is a woman [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=559.96s)]
*  I'm saying [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=564.12s)]
*  You know, this is exactly why you're wearing that shirt that says repeal you should put the 19th under it. It's [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=566.12s)]
*  Unbelievable. What are you talking about a woman? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=573.04s)]
*  Anybody who has ever at one point been afraid of a man? It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=576.4s)]
*  Do you have an actual argument here? Would you let me finish speaking or yeah? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=580.5999999999999s)]
*  How long is it gonna take for you to finish? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=584.92s)]
*  How long is it gonna take for you to finish? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=587.36s)]
*  Yes, do you really just invite people on your show to be interrupted like this? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=589.36s)]
*  Well, come inside look all due respect we did do a bit of research into what you said about me in the past [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=592.66s)]
*  So I think I'm entitled to give you you already know what I think about that question because I've written about you asking that [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=596.82s)]
*  Yes, you have in fact you said like all of the way would you ask it again? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=602.9s)]
*  I know when you know what my I'm just good to enlighten the audience [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=606.54s)]
*  You have no idea what you're talking about or me like all of the biggest that's me apparently currently jumping on the transphobic [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=609.1s)]
*  Shuttle to ding-dong station Morgan wants you to believe this is about fairness and equality [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=615.62s)]
*  Specifically fairness equality in women's sports that was exactly what it was about and the problem is clementine with all due respect to you [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=621.3s)]
*  The reality is I doubt it [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=628.98s)]
*  With perfect respect but your inability to just simply state what a woman actually is [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=632.98s)]
*  Particularly given two weeks ago in the UK the Supreme Court made it very clear that a woman is a biological female [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=639.14s)]
*  That's it it's a scientific fact the fact that you can't answer that is part of the problem [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=646.38s)]
*  I'd like to know the thing is that I would like to know why you in particular are so obsessed [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=651.4399999999999s)]
*  With this definition of what a woman is firstly. How does it impact you in any way? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=658.38s)]
*  Secondly, I have a 13 year old daughter of a 13 year old daughter [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=663.58s)]
*  I think my 13 year old daughter decides she wants to come back [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=667.74s)]
*  You ask me a question you ask me a question. I'm going to answer you [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=670.86s)]
*  You don't want an answer don't ask me a question. Here's my answer to your question. I have a 13 year old [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=674.54s)]
*  13 year old daughter. I have seven nieces [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=680.54s)]
*  Right and some of them are very [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=684.0999999999999s)]
*  I may answer your question [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=686.5799999999999s)]
*  Some of them are very good at sport [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=688.38s)]
*  right the idea that they would one day have their dream of potentially an Olympic place or a team GB place whatever it may be a [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=690.2199999999999s)]
*  World championship place taken from them by a biological male [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=699.38s)]
*  I think is completely outrageous and by the way, so does most of the world now [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=703.62s)]
*  Which is why there's been a reversing screeching u-turn on this particular subject [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=708.1s)]
*  But I come back to my question to you your inability to say what a woman is and yet here you are [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=713.14s)]
*  Lecturing women on how they should behave as women [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=718.9s)]
*  I [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=721.6s)]
*  Think that reducing women specifically to your biological [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=726.9200000000001s)]
*  Decide what you think a woman is it's cool science [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=732.16s)]
*  It's their chromosomes. You have different chromosomes to me. It's not me saying that I'm not writing [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=736.64s)]
*  Writing the science first person. I'm sure I'm not the first person to tell you about intersex people. So how do you [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=744.12s)]
*  People know no, no, this is all wrong. The intersex is not a third sex. It's not a third sex. That's ridiculous [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=752.0s)]
*  There is no third sex. There's two sexes male female [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=758.4s)]
*  categorized scientifically [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  Intersex is not a third sex. Anybody can look that up in five seconds. Hold a lie [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=763.48s)]
*  How did you not know that by the way, how did you not know intersex is not a third sex? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  I didn't say that intersex with a fit with us. You did [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=773.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly what the implication was and intersex people have [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=777.12s)]
*  Intersex people can have a mixture of chromosomes [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=782.08s)]
*  So if you if you are you saying they're a third sex or aren't you if you present to the world as? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=784.76s)]
*  If they're not a third sex then there's you have no argument here [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=790.76s)]
*  Do you understand that if he's what he's saying is why is he so objective? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=795.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'll tell you I don't need I don't need I'm gonna answer the question. I don't need first stop. Yeah [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=807.0s)]
*  Let me speak you just asked a question [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=809.0s)]
*  Clementine and then refusing to allow people to answer [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=813.0s)]
*  Don't ask a question the truth about the truth about the absurd [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=817.36s)]
*  The problem is the problem is feminists in particular [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=820.88s)]
*  I've noticed feminists have latched on over the last few years [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=823.88s)]
*  To this idea that if anybody raised any concerns about the way the trans lobby was trying to make things [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=827.56s)]
*  Unequal unfair and unsafe for actual women then they were immediately transphobic [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=835.5200000000001s)]
*  I kept saying I want trans people to have the exact same rights to fairness equality and safety as me or you [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=841.08s)]
*  However, what was happening was women's rights were being eroded so that things were not fair [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  They weren't equal and they weren't safe and we saw absolute parodies of this in the Olympics in the boxing ring [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=853.9200000000001s)]
*  Where people who have been banned from the world championships because they apparently reported positive for male chromosomes [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=861.08s)]
*  We're getting in the ring and beating women up in the ring [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=868.3s)]
*  And so a woman's gonna die if this was allowed to carry on so now people have stopped it now [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=870.98s)]
*  Sporting bodies around the world stopped it but you Clementine [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=876.52s)]
*  I say this respectfully are still flying the flag for this bullshit and you can't even say what a woman is and I just [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=879.48s)]
*  Find the fact that you want to lecture women like Rachel on how they should be as a woman is completely perverse [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=886.08s)]
*  Giving you don't even know or don't want to say [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=893.0400000000001s)]
*  Rachel I haven't said anything to Rachel. I've never met Rachel before in my life until you responded to what she [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=897.76s)]
*  She responded to what she said about the role of a woman [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=904.0400000000001s)]
*  I wasn't lecturing. I sounded like [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=907.46s)]
*  Let me bring in Emily be waiting patient [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=912.22s)]
*  historical reality of economics in the US [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  Let me bring in Emily you wanted to divert it to talk about trans women because that's clearly you banged on about [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=916.7s)]
*  Women I just said to you if you don't know what a woman is [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=922.7s)]
*  No, she's wrong about the the economic history, she's the one looking at it through an economic prism that's extremely narrow [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=928.22s)]
*  She's using feminist standpoint theory to try to tell us what the history of economics is [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=935.14s)]
*  Yeah, she can't explain to us why what all of human history and all [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=940.14s)]
*  Let her finish lady. Let me be me you talk for money lady. Why I? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=944.4599999999999s)]
*  all of Western history [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=948.9s)]
*  We were able to raise a family like a janitor could raise a family with four children on his income up until [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=951.02s)]
*  1970 and what happened in 1970 we pushed women into the workforce in huge numbers and we practically doubled the workforce [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=957.5s)]
*  overnight by pushing mothers and women into the workforce. This [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=965.06s)]
*  happened right alongside the creation of gender studies as an [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=969.3399999999999s)]
*  academic discipline and now we are in a situation where we don't [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=972.02s)]
*  have a family economy. We have an individual income economy which [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=975.4599999999999s)]
*  means most people can't raise a family without both parents [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=979.4599999999999s)]
*  working. OK, let me bring in Emily, she's been waiting very [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=982.6199999999999s)]
*  patiently. Emily, good to see you again. Now, you started a kind of [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=985.06s)]
*  MAGA civil war when you railed against women who want to be a [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=989.3s)]
*  trad wife. You posted a TikTok video which caused a lot of [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=993.38s)]
*  mayhem. Let's take a look at this. I'm sorry, I hate to call out [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=997.3s)]
*  my own party but the young girls on the right promoting this like [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1001.54s)]
*  trad wife bullshit. I just want to make sourdough for my husband. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1005.62s)]
*  That's great. I'm all for it. I promote traditional values. I [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1009.78s)]
*  understand. I have been working since I was very young. I don't [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1012.74s)]
*  really plan on stop being working. I suggest you find a [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1016.18s)]
*  hobby that makes you money. But you guys, guess what? Guess [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1019.7800000000001s)]
*  what, baby girl, that lifestyle working out, a man, a provider, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1023.86s)]
*  you just get to sit at home, bake bread every day, slim to [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1026.82s)]
*  none. I would say none that that's going to work out for you [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1029.7s)]
*  or quite literally anyone you know. You're actually setting [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1033.3s)]
*  yourself up for failure because it could not be easier if [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1036.18s)]
*  that's what you're going to pursue to be trapped by a man. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1039.6200000000001s)]
*  OK, also let's bring some other things to the table besides [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1042.82s)]
*  sourdough. Guys want to be mentally stimulated as well as [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1047.22s)]
*  physical, OK? But I'm just like, please, you guys are too young to [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1051.38s)]
*  be promoting this. And also, by the way, it's cringe. You guys are [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1054.98s)]
*  cringe, OK? Now, Emily, are you standing proudly by that TikTok? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1058.82s)]
*  Thank you guys for laughing. That is supposed to be the point of [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1068.1s)]
*  a lot of my videos. I don't take things too seriously. I usually [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1071.22s)]
*  say things like this and don't think anything of it. I do want [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1074.4199999999998s)]
*  to point out in the video, I did start it by being like, look, I [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1077.6999999999998s)]
*  love stay at home moms. I support them. I promote [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1080.6599999999999s)]
*  conservative values. I think the issue with the video is a lot [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1083.22s)]
*  of people just took the video and then gave their own meaning. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1086.6599999999999s)]
*  The group I was specifically bashing on was the young girls in [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1090.58s)]
*  their 20s that promote like traditional lifestyles online [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1093.6999999999998s)]
*  that we all know in the right wing community absolutely do not [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1097.3799999999999s)]
*  live these lifestyles. And it's just a bit over the top. It's [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1100.34s)]
*  kind of more cosplay than anything. So of course, I support [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1104.5s)]
*  moms that do that. I just don't support the girls pretending to [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1107.62s)]
*  do it, I guess, if that kind of makes sense. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1111.06s)]
*  I'm not sure it does. Andrew, does it make sense to you? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1113.3s)]
*  Well, I mean, she's right in a sense that there's a lot of [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1116.34s)]
*  larping that goes on on the right with the supposed traditional [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1118.34s)]
*  movement, which she's absolutely right, isn't living the [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1122.34s)]
*  traditional lifestyle. However, it's still a counterintuitive [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1125.62s)]
*  message to put out there that, oh, you're going to be trapped [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1128.26s)]
*  by your husband and his income. It's like, good. Don't you want [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1131.3s)]
*  to be in a relationship with your husband and have access to [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1134.98s)]
*  his income? Like, what's the problem here? That would be the [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1137.86s)]
*  values you're trying to move towards, right? So ultimately, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1140.34s)]
*  it's a contradicting message. I understand why you got a bunch [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1143.06s)]
*  of garbage for it. It is a good idea, I think, to point out the [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1145.78s)]

*  ridicules women for wanting to be stay at home moms and actually [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1165.3s)]
*  live some type of lifestyle, which is conducive to their [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1168.42s)]

*  The clip. Yeah, I mean, also trapped is just the wrong word to [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1174.34s)]
*  use. But overall, my message I stand by. Okay, I want to play [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1177.06s)]
*  because I think it fits in well here. The Caroline Levitt clip. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1181.14s)]
*  This is where she's working with her baby. We'll just show the [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1184.82s)]
*  picture of her working at the White House with a baby in one [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1188.6599999999999s)]
*  hand and helping to run the country with the other. Now, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1191.62s)]
*  when I first saw that picture, I thought, wow, that's a pretty [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1194.98s)]
*  extraordinary, powerful image of a young woman who's very young to [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1197.3799999999999s)]
*  be doing the incredibly important job she does. She does [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1201.2199999999998s)]
*  it, I think, extraordinarily well. And she's a mother. And [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1203.9399999999998s)]
*  she's feeding her son whilst doing this at the same time. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1208.82s)]
*  Rachel, when you saw that image, it got a lot of blowback, good [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1211.06s)]
*  and bad. You know, some people loved it. Some people hated it. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1214.8999999999999s)]
*  What did you think about it? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1218.26s)]
*  Well, I actually tweeted about this too, because although I'm a [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1220.6599999999999s)]
*  big fan of Caroline as a person, I think she's great. She's smart. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1223.62s)]
*  She's lovely. I don't understand this compulsion, especially in [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1227.3799999999999s)]
*  the Trump administration, but on the right in general, where [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1231.22s)]
*  we're supposed to be conservatives, where we are pushing [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1233.7s)]
*  mothers to work. Trump has been a huge proponent of hiring women, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1237.62s)]
*  getting women back to work as soon as possible after having the [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1242.26s)]

*  are we conserving? If we're not conserving the traditional family [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1248.02s)]

*  birth rate crisis, what are we conserving as conservatives? Just [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1256.82s)]
*  like lower taxes? I mean, this should be a core issue for us on [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1260.82s)]
*  the right to say, no, motherhood is not a part-time gig that you do [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1265.06s)]

*  spending three times as much time with a low-wage daycare worker as [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1273.06s)]

*  life to live after raising kids. I think after you've done that, if [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1280.34s)]
*  you want to venture out and do a few more things, once you have the [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1284.26s)]
*  empty nest, I think that's okay. But pushing mothers to work is one [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1287.62s)]
*  of the key things that's tearing apart the fabric of society because [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1292.42s)]
*  we're not raising our own children. We're not passing down our values [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1295.46s)]
*  to them. We're sending them to daycare and we're sending them to [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1298.5800000000002s)]
*  state-run schools and that's who they're being raised by. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1301.6200000000001s)]
*  All right, Clementine, your response to that. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1304.74s)]
*  Do you work, Rachel? No. You don't make any money from your podcasting? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1309.7s)]
*  I make some money, but I do. Or your appearances. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1317.94s)]
*  I do maybe a couple. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1320.5800000000002s)]
*  You do some form of paid employment? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1321.6200000000001s)]
*  Yes. First of all, my children are grown up now. I'm 44 years old, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1324.9s)]
*  so I had my first one at 20. They're grown up. They're moved out. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1328.5s)]
*  But I work still very, very part-time, maybe a couple hours a week at most. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1331.94s)]
*  But do you have- [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1337.3s)]
*  Because my primary responsibility is to my husband. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1337.94s)]
*  But you've got five children, right? Is that correct? And they're all [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1342.3400000000001s)]
*  growing up and all moved out or you've still got some young children? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1346.5s)]
*  The youngest ones are teenagers. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1349.6200000000001s)]
*  And by the way, you're just making an argument from hypocrisy. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1352.58s)]
*  Can I just ask you, do you find, even with the small amount of part-time [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1355.14s)]
*  work that you do, which you do get paid for, do you find satisfaction from that? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1362.18s)]
*  Do you get satisfaction from that work? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1367.38s)]
*  It's not the money because Andrew makes far more than I make. I make a very, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1369.06s)]
*  very tiny amount of money off of my book and a couple of appearances here and there, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1372.98s)]
*  might sell a few books. It's practically nothing. If I was doing it for the money, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1377.94s)]
*  it'd be a waste of even a couple of hours. But what I would say to that is we're not [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1382.02s)]
*  against women doing other things. So if you look at the Bible and the Proverbs 31 woman, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1387.78s)]
*  she does a lot of things. She's out buying land. She's making decisions. She's [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1392.5s)]
*  doing all kinds of things. The difference is that she's doing them under the purview of the guidance [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1397.06s)]
*  and leadership of her husband and for her family, not for a corporation, not for her own- [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1401.94s)]
*  Glory, not for her own ambition. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1408.02s)]
*  A lot of that depends on whether or not you have faith in the Bible, which obviously not everyone [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1411.3s)]
*  does. But the reason I asked you those questions wasn't because I was trying to set you up or [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1416.42s)]
*  anything like that. It doesn't surprise me that you would get some satisfaction. To me, the point [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1420.58s)]
*  of the question wasn't about the money. It's about the work. It's about the passion that you put into [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1425.46s)]
*  it. And the reason I asked was because a multi-year study done by Adrienne Freck and Sarah Damaske [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1431.1399999999999s)]
*  found that the mental health of women who worked full-time after the birth of their first child [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1437.54s)]
*  was significantly higher than those who didn't have paid work at all. So I think that taking [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1441.78s)]
*  into account the fact that for a lot of women, and this is also what Betty Friedan found when [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1446.98s)]
*  she wrote The Feminine Mystique, and Stephanie Coons backed this up as well in her book The Way [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1450.98s)]
*  We Never Were, which is a history of a lot of American families- But are you married, Clementine? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1455.38s)]
*  I have no idea about your situation. But are you married? Do you have kids? What's your deal? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1458.58s)]
*  I've got a kid. I'm not married. I'm a single mother. And I have a very excellent relationship [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1462.82s)]
*  with my son's father. We co-parent together very well, but we're not married. We don't live together. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1470.8999999999999s)]
*  I certainly have found since having a child- I mean, I've always worked anyway. I've been working [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1477.06s)]
*  since I was 13 years old. But I've always found that work for me is very satisfying. And what I'm [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1481.78s)]
*  saying is that these are the findings of multiple historians, anthropologist scientists that- [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1487.1399999999999s)]
*  No, these are the findings of diehard feminists who are only investigating this from a feminist [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1492.58s)]
*  point of view. They're already sold on the ideology. And what they do is they cherry pick data- [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1498.4199999999998s)]
*  Stephanie Coons is a world-renowned historian. She's not specifically a feminist. She's a world-renowned [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1503.06s)]
*  historian. And these were her findings as well. So you cannot deny the reality. If you look at the [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1507.3s)]
*  facts of it, you cannot deny the reality. We're not saying women can never leave the house. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1514.18s)]
*  We're not saying you can't have other things in your life that you find fulfilling. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1520.5800000000002s)]
*  You're suggesting that the primary role for a woman, and that in your faith, I'm not going to [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1524.98s)]
*  discredit that, but your faith in God says that this is what you believe God says that you should [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1529.94s)]
*  be doing. But the primary role for a woman is that she should be staying at home, that she should be [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1533.8600000000001s)]
*  devoted to her husband, she should be devoted to her children. The facts do not back that up. The [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1538.9s)]
*  facts of familial satisfaction don't back that up. Hang on. Sorry, Clementine, I think you've [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1543.94s)]
*  chosen the wrong moment to say that. You've clearly got a woman here on the panel where the facts [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1554.02s)]
*  completely back that up. She's had a lot of kids. She's very happily married. You know that there [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1560.18s)]
*  would be exceptions to the rule, but statistically speaking, statistically speaking, the daughter- [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1565.6200000000001s)]
*  That's completely untrue though. For her to say that this one survey is going to tell us something. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1571.22s)]
*  First of all, we have two massive worldwide- It was a multi-year study. Let me ask you, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1577.46s)]
*  Clementine, when you were, were you married or not? I can't remember what you said. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1582.0200000000002s)]
*  Were you married? No, I've never been married. Okay. When you were with your partner before you broke up, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1588.66s)]
*  who did the household chores and stuff like that? How did you delineate that as a feminist? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1592.18s)]
*  It was a struggle because even in lots of supposedly egalitarian households, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1596.34s)]
*  again, the data backs up that women, even women who make more money than their partners or their [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1604.5s)]
*  spouses tend to do more unpaid domestic labor. This is the terrible bond that women are in. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1609.4599999999998s)]
*  Who did most of the domestic chores? In my house. Yeah. Me. You did? Me. Okay. And Rachel, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1614.8999999999999s)]
*  who does most of them in yours? That's the reality for most women. Who does the domestic [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1623.3s)]
*  stuff in your house, Rachel? I do absolutely all of it. And the thing I want to say- So you're [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1629.06s)]
*  very similar. I mean, it seems to me you're both- I care far less about women's fulfillment in [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1634.18s)]
*  careers than I care about children and how they're being raised. And I want her to justify to me [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1640.34s)]
*  why we should be paying low wage daycare workers to raise our children rather than doing it ourselves. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1645.3799999999999s)]
*  How does it make sense to take your duty of motherhood and simply put it on a different [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1651.3s)]
*  random woman? How does that system make sense? Why should we tell women to do that? Rachel, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1655.78s)]
*  if you would like to stay at home and raise your children, that's totally fine. You're not answering [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1659.78s)]
*  the question. My question is, is it good for children for them to be raised by daycare workers? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1665.38s)]
*  No. Why is it better outcomes? Why is it better? It's actually not worse. It's not worse for children [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1672.5s)]
*  to be raised by working mothers. You don't think so? The facts back that up. There is no study that [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1674.42s)]
*  suggests that women who work raise children who are less happy. That is not true. There are no [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1680.98s)]
*  facts on planet earth that back up that single mother households have better outcomes. That's [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1686.26s)]
*  one. Two, that outsourcing your- Who are they raising guys? Did I specifically mention single [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1690.5s)]
*  mothers? That's you bringing your- Lady, if you outsource the raising of your children, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1694.9s)]
*  you're already making yourself a single mother, just so you know. Here's what's going on. Just [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1700.18s)]
*  so that you understand. Are you a single father because your wife raised your children for you? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1704.34s)]
*  Excuse me, don't call me lady. Can anybody finish a point? Can anybody finish a point? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1710.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't know, do you have a point? You don't seem to be making one. I'm trying to make one. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1716.7399999999998s)]
*  You don't seem to be making a point, Andrew. If you outsource your children's raising to strangers, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1720.34s)]
*  answer Rachel's question and tell her how that makes more sense than having the child raised [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1726.4199999999998s)]
*  by their own biological mother. Actually answer. Well, in my case, it makes more sense because [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1731.78s)]
*  I need to make money to pay my bills to raise my child. It's a miscounted duty. What if you [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1739.46s)]
*  depend on your husband's income? Do you see the problem of how we end up here? Now it's my turn [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1745.8600000000001s)]
*  to finish. But actually, again, if you knew what you were talking about, if you actually [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1752.82s)]
*  read anything about the data on these things rather than just reaching into your gut for a [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1760.82s)]
*  feeling that feels true to you. Let's go over the data. Show me the data that shows that if you [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1765.78s)]
*  outsource your child care. There was a father in the household who worked on that. Let me bring Emily in. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1769.7s)]
*  There is no statistical data to support the fact that children raised by mothers who work [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1773.3799999999999s)]
*  are less happy than children raised by mothers who stay at home. Yes, there is. There's tons of data. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1780.8999999999999s)]
*  I would never try and stop Rachel. There's so much overwhelming data. That's her choice. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1784.42s)]
*  That's her choice to do that. There is so much overwhelming data. Because that's her choice. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1790.26s)]
*  All you need is to spell it with all the women. Let me bring Emily in. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1794.9s)]
*  And yours knows that. Emily was trying to say something. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1797.7800000000002s)]
*  Yes, you don't want your daughters and your nieces being forced to stay at home to raise [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1800.02s)]
*  families. You don't want them to have choice. I don't want my kids to be forced to do anything. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1804.5800000000002s)]
*  No, Emily, you wanted to say something. Yeah. Yeah, no, I mean, look, I'm not going to argue [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1809.6200000000001s)]
*  data with either of you guys. I'm sure you know more than me, but I can say that my father is [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1815.46s)]
*  my hero and the most important person in my life. And if I didn't have him and he wasn't in the [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1821.38s)]
*  household, I don't know where I would be today. And my girlfriends who were raised without fathers [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1825.46s)]
*  in the household, I do see them struggle in different ways when it comes to dating and all [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1830.74s)]
*  these different things. And it's funny because it's like they do make a point. Like if there was a [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1835.0600000000002s)]
*  father in the household supporting you, I think a lot of these issues wouldn't be what they are. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1839.22s)]
*  So I think there's points to both of these things. Okay, let me ask Andrew. Andrew. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1844.3400000000001s)]
*  Supporting in what way? Is your name Andrew? Anyway, go ahead, Pierce. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1848.98s)]
*  Yeah, Andrew, I was going to ask Andrew. When Rachel said that she does all domestic chores, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1852.66s)]
*  is there anything you do? I mean, do you put the bins out? Do you, you know, do you trash out? I mean, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1856.66s)]
*  what do you do? Anything? I don't do shit. That's what I got a wife for. Maybe a little yard work. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1861.22s)]
*  But not only that. If something breaks or there's yard work, that's about it. Yeah, cars need repairs, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1867.46s)]
*  something like that. But I'm not going to do household chores. That's what I got married for. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1872.26s)]
*  I don't want to do household chores. Not only that, on top of that, let's just point a couple [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1875.22s)]
*  things out. She's absolutely wrong. Here's what the stats actually say. That if a child is raised in [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1878.9s)]
*  a two parent household, they're going to have way better outcomes. And if they have a present mother [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1884.58s)]
*  who is more present with them, they're going to have way better outcomes. Every single data point [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1890.58s)]
*  backs this up. The outsourcing of children to public school, especially for eight hours a day, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1895.3s)]
*  is absurd. Stop, stop. Let me finish the point. Let me finish the point and then you can respond. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1899.54s)]
*  Let me finish the point. I've got to say, someone who doesn't like being interrupted, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1905.6200000000001s)]
*  you interrupt a lot. Why is it that you won't let me finish the point? I got a text message from [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1910.02s)]
*  your producer, Piers, telling me to interrupt if I disagreed with anyone. Yeah, yeah. So take it up [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1913.38s)]
*  with them. I think what's changed since that text message is you've made a point of objecting to [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1918.02s)]
*  being interrupted. So I know that you can do that and then keep interrupting. So that's just the [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1923.78s)]
*  state of play right now. Why don't you practice what you preach and don't interrupt Andrew when [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1928.5s)]
*  he's trying to finish his point? Yeah. So look, I've just finished the point. Would he make a [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1932.42s)]
*  point? He hasn't made one yet. Yeah, I just did. I made multiple points. All the data points are [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1935.78s)]
*  against you on this. Well, he's made the point that he doesn't respect his wife because he married a [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1940.1000000000001s)]
*  wife because he didn't want to do anything for himself. You still can't stop talking, lady. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1943.78s)]
*  This is why it should say the night teeth under that shirt. You cannot even be quiet long enough [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1948.02s)]
*  to hear a counterpoint. Here's the counterpoints. The data you're citing, you don't have any when [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1952.9s)]
*  it comes to outcomes for children, when it comes to outsourcing, they're right. Incorrect. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1958.34s)]
*  None. Not correct. Show me any that shows that you sending your kids outsourcing. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1962.74s)]
*  Which data are you citing? Would you stop so that I can finish the question? No, no, tell me. Tell me. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1967.62s)]
*  I'm trying to at least finish the question. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Here's the thing. One more time. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1972.02s)]
*  All data points to the fact that if you outsource the raising of your children, especially when [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1977.78s)]
*  you're young. You stand there and say all data, you actually have to cite it. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1982.98s)]
*  Cite any data that shows. All data does not say that. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1986.26s)]
*  Show, cite any data ever that shows that you outsourcing the care of your child is good for [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1988.9s)]
*  the child. Any. Stephanie Koontz. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1994.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Nothing. You got, Stephanie Koontz doesn't say that. You're lying. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=1997.22s)]
*  Do you even know who Stephanie Koontz is? Yes. Do you mean the feminist right here? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2001.7s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, Stephanie Koontz is. I have no idea. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2005.22s)]
*  See, you clearly don't even know what you're talking about. I don't. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2008.1s)]
*  I can tell you. You're not even interested. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2011.22s)]
*  You're not even interested enough in the topic. I'm sorry. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2013.14s)]
*  You're not even interested enough to respect the topic enough. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2015.38s)]
*  Let's make sure we got it right. Stephanie Koontz. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2018.58s)]
*  Stephanie Koontz is an historian. A world renowned historian into marriage and [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2021.78s)]
*  the story. And isn't a feminist, right? Isn't a feminist. I just want to make sure we're clear. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2027.46s)]
*  I don't. I have no idea if she's a feminist or not. I know that she's a historian. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2031.8600000000001s)]
*  Why would you try to make a refutation about what I'm saying? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2034.82s)]
*  Clearly, you don't know enough about the topic. It's silly. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2038.42s)]
*  I'm not allowed to reference historians. Is that we're only so if you have a historian [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2045.46s)]
*  is also only allowed to reference if you have a story is also a feminist or their bias, right? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2050.34s)]
*  That's going to be Clementine. Clementine. Let me ask you. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2055.54s)]
*  Why are you so obsessed with whether or not she's a feminist? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2057.94s)]
*  Clementine, let me ask you a question. Let me try and answer. Ask a question here. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2060.26s)]
*  Clementine, do you hate men? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2066.02s)]
*  No, of course I don't hate men. What an absurd, reductive question. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2069.38s)]
*  Why in 2020 did you tweet the coronavirus isn't killing men fast enough? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2078.1s)]
*  I tweeted that in 2020 as a misguided tweet, but it was actually much of a part of a longer... [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2083.7s)]
*  Misguided tweet. Coronavirus isn't killing men fast enough. You say you don't hate men. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2088.58s)]
*  I apologize for it, Piers. You thought a deadly pandemic virus wasn't killing men fast enough. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2094.1s)]
*  Apologize to men again. Do it again. You haven't apologized to me for saying that you want me to die [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2099.54s)]
*  from the coronavirus. I would have to consider you a man to apologize for that, Andrew. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2106.66s)]
*  Say you're sorry. You don't even know what a woman is. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2110.1s)]
*  Why would I apologize to you? Andrew, I would like for you to apologize to me [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2112.74s)]
*  because I do not appreciate her saying that my own husband does not respect me. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2119.22s)]
*  Of course he respects me. He respects me as a mother and as a wife. He treats me like gold. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2124.58s)]
*  Who the hell are you to tell me if he respects me or not? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2131.14s)]
*  You wouldn't have to get paid for this if you had a husband. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2135.62s)]
*  I didn't say that he... Where did I even mention? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2137.2999999999997s)]
*  You did. You said he clearly doesn't respect his wife. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2139.7s)]
*  You did say that. I heard you say that. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2141.8599999999997s)]
*  You mean the piece of shit that you're married to. Yeah, he clearly doesn't respect you. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2143.54s)]
*  Oh, there we go. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2147.7s)]
*  Lady, hey lady, he's not the piece of shit in this panel. That would be you, man. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2148.98s)]
*  That's right. You're the one... Listen, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2155.14s)]
*  let's get back to the topic here. You're the one who is insisting that there's no data... [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2156.98s)]
*  The topic, the list of topics that we will set up. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2161.46s)]
*  Shut your mouth. Okay, hang on. Time out. I would genuinely like to know. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2163.54s)]
*  You said it was misguided to say the coronavirus wasn't killing men fast enough. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2168.5s)]
*  Yeah, it was a terrible thing to say. It was a terrible thing to say to you. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2172.5s)]
*  No, I understand... I already said that the... [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2175.38s)]
*  Don't worry, let me finish my question. I do understand it's a terrible thing to say. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2176.82s)]
*  My question, my bemusement, why would you say that? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2180.82s)]
*  Because I was really frustrated with the articles that I was reading about how the pandemic was... [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2185.54s)]
*  It was derailing women's workplace... It was derailing women's economic trajectories. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2192.1s)]
*  And there was a specific article that I had read about a woman who had founded her own company. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2199.7000000000003s)]
*  She was the CEO of it. Her husband had taken a sabbatical prior to the pandemic. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2203.78s)]
*  And within two days of childcare closing down, he said, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2208.9s)]
*  I can't take care of the four-year-old. And she quit her job to go home and look after the kid. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2211.6200000000003s)]
*  What's that got to do with you wanting more men to be killed? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2216.26s)]
*  So that's one person... Piers, if you're going to ask me the question, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2220.34s)]
*  then let me finish it. You know what, Clementine? When you tweet, literally, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2222.5800000000004s)]
*  coronavirus isn't killing men fast enough, I think I'm entitled to push you a little bit more [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2227.46s)]
*  than it was a bit misguided. You're literally calling for the mass culling of men while [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2231.94s)]
*  simultaneously pretending you don't hate men. Oh, my God. Piers, come on. You know that... [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2237.3s)]
*  Don't be disingenuous. You know that that's not what I was calling for. You know that it was a... [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2242.42s)]
*  You literally said coronavirus isn't killing men fast enough. You know that it was a glib tweet. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2246.98s)]
*  And you know that I also apologised for it shortly after that. You know that I was sincere [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2251.62s)]
*  in my apology. You didn't apologise to me. So why are you dragging it out five years later? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2255.54s)]
*  Can you apologise to Andrew, please? Well, you apologised to me for saying you wanted me to die. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2258.74s)]
*  I would not apologise to you if I did something to you, let alone for doing nothing to you. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2263.46s)]
*  If you did something to me, I wouldn't apologise. Was that the only time... Clementine... [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2269.7s)]
*  This is the kind of unseen thing that you want called the un-created date here, by the way. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2273.7s)]
*  I have a follow-up. Clementine, was that the only time you've tweeted that you want all men to be killed? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2277.54s)]
*  Yes, why don't you just say what you want to say? No, I'm just asking a question. Have you tweeted [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2283.06s)]
*  previously? No, I have tweeted prior to that, kill all men, as a joke. As a joke, right. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2287.6200000000003s)]
*  As a joke. Very funny joke. So you quite regularly think it's funny to say that men should be killed. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2293.6200000000003s)]
*  No, I don't quite regularly. There's two examples that you can think of. You don't hate men, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2297.78s)]
*  but you did tweet kill all men, and then you tweeted the coronavirus isn't killing men fast enough. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2302.82s)]
*  I put it to you. Oh, hang on, I've also... I put it to you. I've also... [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2307.06s)]
*  I've also tweeted that men should be fired into the sun. I've also said that men should be fired [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2310.82s)]
*  into the sun. Tell me, at what point do these very clearly glib, and yes, I have apologised for them, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2318.6600000000003s)]
*  but very clearly glib tweets, from a time as well where Twitter was such a toxic... I don't [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2326.6600000000003s)]
*  tweet anymore, it's a bad place for everybody. At what point [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2333.46s)]
*  do those things that be accepted as glib, misguided, regrettable, deeply apologetic for them now, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2339.86s)]
*  remark that you would never say again? You don't sound very apologetic. I think you should just [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2348.02s)]
*  admit that you don't like men. I think it's the problem comes when you keep denying... I don't like [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2351.94s)]
*  you very much, Piers. I don't care if you like me or not. You spray gun me in public. I couldn't [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2357.06s)]
*  give a damn. Why do I have to sit here and admit to you that I don't like men? What do you hope... [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2363.06s)]
*  I just asked you if you do or not. You said you don't hate men. I said that I did. You spend [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2366.82s)]
*  all your time wanting us to be dead. Hang on, Piers, she loves me. You just shoot a minute of [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2371.06s)]
*  smoke, that's all. You don't like me, you think Andrew's a piece of shit, so that's every single [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2376.82s)]
*  man involved in this debate you hate. Every man in this debate, Clementine, you said you hate. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2382.58s)]
*  I hate every single man involved in this debate. Emily, what was that? I hate every man in this debate. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2389.62s)]
*  I'm saying if you live a life where you've been unsuccessful in relationships, whether it's [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2395.38s)]
*  friendship, love, marriage, whatever it is, I think you're probably the last person in the position to [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2400.1s)]
*  be giving advice what women should do with men. I mean, I don't feel any animosity towards men. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2404.98s)]
*  How do you know that I've been unsuccessful in friendships and relationships? That's a very odd... [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2411.06s)]
*  That's a very odd... Well, being a single mother doesn't mean that I'm unsuccessful in relationships. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2416.7400000000002s)]
*  I already said before that I have a very beautiful co-parenting relationship with my son's father. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2421.7000000000003s)]
*  He lives in the same apartment building as us. We're deeply close friends. I don't understand [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2425.86s)]
*  why you think that is... I'm not bitter towards men at all. I'm annoyed at the expectation that [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2431.86s)]
*  some men have, some men on this panel have, that women should do everything for them. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2441.94s)]
*  I'm certainly angry at the fact that in the UK... Wait a second. Do you think Andrew does everything? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2447.14s)]
*  I mean, excuse me, I can't do everything for my boyfriend. I'm angry that in the UK a woman is [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2452.34s)]
*  killed every three days by a man. I'm angry that in America three women are killed every day by a man. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2457.06s)]
*  How many men are killed every day by a man? Globally, one woman is killed every 10 minutes by an... [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2462.98s)]
*  How many men are killed? How many babies do you women kill? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2471.14s)]
*  There's lots of things I'm angry about. And I'm angry about that. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2473.54s)]
*  Yeah, how many babies do you guys kill? I'm angry about the fact that one to three girls [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2475.4599999999996s)]
*  over the age of 15 will experience sexual violence in her lifetime. I'm very angry about that. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2478.8199999999997s)]
*  No, that's another fake statistic and I would love to tear this apart. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2482.66s)]
*  I'm angry about rape and sexual assault. I'm angry about the fact that the most dangerous person, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2483.9399999999996s)]
*  tool woman, is a man that she knows. I'm angry about all of these things. Yes, but that doesn't [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2488.8999999999996s)]
*  mean that I hate men. That doesn't mean that I don't... You just want to shoot them into the sun. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2493.4599999999996s)]
*  And I have the data to prove it. For men's greatness with women and with [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2497.78s)]
*  children. You want to shoot men into the sun. You want them killed by coronavirus. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2501.6200000000003s)]
*  And you want all of us dead and you hate both the men on the panel. Other than that, you love men. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2505.38s)]
*  You love them. You love them. They're great. Even though there are... [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2509.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, there's two other things that I hate. Well, can't you admit that you [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2511.86s)]
*  at least like men enough that they gave you a beautiful child you're super grateful of? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2518.82s)]
*  I mean, that's a positive. This is honestly one of the most absurd conversations I've ever had [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2522.5s)]
*  in my life. I've just sat here and explained that I don't hate men. I've just sat here and explained [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2528.18s)]
*  that I have a wonderful relationship with my son's father. I've just sat here and said that [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2533.86s)]
*  I've apologized for these things that I've said in the past. We've all said terrible things. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2539.94s)]
*  Piers, you've said terrible things on Twitter. We've all said terrible things and apologized. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2544.5s)]
*  Name one. Hang on. What did I say? What did I say? Name one. Oh, Piers, do you want me to look them up right now? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2548.5s)]
*  Yes, please. Okay, let me... Just give me a second to go to... Tell me a terrible thing I said on Twitter. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2555.38s)]
*  Piers Morgan. Terrible twinks. While she's looking, can I refute her fake statistics that she just gave [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2559.7s)]
*  because I hear from... Piers Morgan. Terrible opinions. There we go. Look at that. Give me a terrible opinion. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2564.98s)]
*  With Rachel, I thought you were talking while I'm just scrolling through the... [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2573.14s)]
*  We can all wait, Clementine. The clock is ticking, though. I mean, find one terrible thing that I've tweeted. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2576.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, can I think that all lives matter was pretty bad. You think all lives matter? It's a bit better [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2583.38s)]
*  than men should be dying faster. Let's just compare all lives matter against more men should die faster. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2588.26s)]
*  All lives matter is a rejection of black lives matter. I didn't reject black lives matter. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2595.1400000000003s)]
*  I didn't reject black lives matter. I didn't reject it. I didn't reject black lives matter. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2600.5s)]
*  I didn't reject black lives matter. Don't lie. No, but you did. No, I didn't. No, I didn't. You see, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2606.82s)]
*  this is a trouble. You say that I've said terrible things. When you try and find them, you don't have [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2612.26s)]
*  any. I'm second to looking at it right here, Piers. All lives matter. He didn't say white lives matter. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2617.3s)]
*  He said all lives matter, which is true in any decent human world. Do you not think all lives matter, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2622.9s)]
*  Clementine? It's absolutely ridiculous. Clementine, do all lives matter? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2626.82s)]
*  I think that all lives deserve respect. Do they matter? Do all lives matter, Clementine? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2631.86s)]
*  You do know what? All lives do matter. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2638.5s)]
*  The one terrible thing you found I've ever said you completely agree with. So on that [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2644.42s)]
*  delightful note, where you agree with the one terrible thing that I've ever apparently said, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2651.1400000000003s)]
*  we will leave this compelling debate. Thank you all very much indeed. I will agree. I've got to [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2656.02s)]
*  say, Rachel, I think Rachel is loving to see a very happily married couple who genuinely like [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2660.5s)]
*  each other. So thank you for coming on Uncensored. And in your case, Clementine, I hope you find a [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBTccfWeB4&t=2666.9s)]
