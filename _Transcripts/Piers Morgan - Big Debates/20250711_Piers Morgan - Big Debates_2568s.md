Dr Zahi Hawass is perceived by many as the number one expert in the world on the subject of Egypt's mighty Pyramids, serving as the Chief Inspector of the Great Pyramids, the Director General of the Giza Monuments and the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt.
However, to his critics, he is an academic ‘gatekeeper’ - accused of being an elitist Egyptologist, who is preventing the real truth about how, when and why the Pyramids were built from being revealed - an attitude that was illustrated in the reaction to his appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience earlier this year.
He joins Uncensored to answer some burning questions from Piers Morgan and independent researcher and host of ‘Bright Insight’ Jimmy Corsetti and independent researcher and host of ‘DeDunking The Past’ Dan Richards.

# "You CAN'T Just DRILL Into It!” Giza Pyramids - Is The Truth Being Hidden? With Dr Zahi Hawass
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys)
*  Who should work in the pyramids? You have to bring scientists from a museum, from a university, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=0.0s)]
*  but you cannot bring an amateur from New York or London. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  You want to squash debate involving, you know, conspiracy theorists and everything. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=8.96s)]
*  All we got to do is go in and look. We know where it's at. We could drill a hole. This is, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=12.96s)]
*  this is doable. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=16.4s)]
*  This is the pyramid of Egypt. This is something valuable. This one of the seven wonders of the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=17.52s)]
*  world. You just can go and boom and drill like this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=22.96s)]
*  When you were on Joe Rogan, you said that you didn't know what Zeph Tepi was. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=26.08s)]
*  And as the premier Egyptologist in the world, you do know the Egyptian creation myth. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=30.56s)]
*  Would you mind just explaining it to us real quick so that to kind of vindicate yourself [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  and show the world you do know what Zeph Tepi is? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=38.64s)]
*  I teach the Egyptian creation, but I'm saying this term that you're talking about, I never heard of it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=41.599999999999994s)]
*  Are you saying on the record there has been no exploration in the way that Jimmy Corsetti says? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=48.08s)]
*  Jimmy, this conspiracy theory that you do have is wrong completely. We are not hiding anything. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=55.84s)]
*  To his Legion of admirers, Dr Zahi Hawass is the world's top expert on Egypt's mighty pyramids. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=65.76s)]
*  And for good reason. Throughout an illustrious career, Dr Hawass has served as the chief [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=72.64s)]
*  inspector of the Great Pyramids, director general of the Giza Monuments, and the secretary general [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=77.12s)]
*  of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt. His book, Giza and the Pyramids, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=82.64s)]
*  is considered the definitive account. But to his critics, he's an academic gatekeeper, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=87.52s)]
*  an elitist of Egyptology, who is preventing others from interrogating the real truth [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  about how, when, and why the pyramids were built. Many Joe Rogan's audience felt that way [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  after his appearance earlier this year. Most of the information that's written on [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  pyramids are wrong. Most of it? Most of it. In archaeology books? In archaeology books. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=108.16s)]
*  Really? Except me and Mark Liener. You guys are the only ones that have it right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  Because I have been working in Giza for the last 57 years of my life. I excavated every piece of sand. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=118.72s)]
*  Well in this special edition of Uncensored, Dr Zahi Hawass will join me to discuss his [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=126.96s)]
*  incredible work and will be joined by two of his most high-profile critics from the alternative [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=131.92s)]
*  archaeology community who say the truth about the pyramids has yet to be revealed. And we'll bring [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=136.96s)]
*  those two gentlemen in shortly. But first of all, Dr Hawass, first of all, welcome to Uncensored. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=142.16s)]
*  Let me just ask you, first of all, what was your reaction to the reaction you got [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=148.32s)]
*  when you appeared on the Joe Rogan podcast? Because a lot of it was very negative. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  No, I, when I give any talk about pyramids, I expect the person who interviewed me to read about [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=158.08s)]
*  pyramids or to read about our work. I am sorry when I did this last interview. I didn't see [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=170.32s)]
*  that Mr Rogan did really read anything that we published. And that's why I was trying to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=179.04s)]
*  refer to our excavation, to our book, and so on. But I am sorry that he said that this show [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=186.32s)]
*  was the worst he did. And after that he said it was good. It's his opinion. But I do, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=196.88s)]
*  when I talk about evidence of how the Egyptians built the pyramids, I present all the archaeological [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=203.92s)]
*  evidence that I do have. In the other side, I don't see any evidence that anyone can give me [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=211.6s)]
*  to say that pyramids built by so and so. And that was my point, my point that I have been [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=221.44s)]
*  excavating in Egypt for the last 57 years. I excavated every piece of sand at Giza Plateau. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=229.92s)]
*  Then when I present a theory or any idea, I present it with evidence. I'm not talking about [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=240.32s)]
*  something on air. No, I'm talking about what we have been discovered at Giza for the last 50 years. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=249.84s)]
*  But let me ask you, if you don't mind me just quibbling about one thing, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=258.64s)]
*  have you really examined every grain of sand at Giza? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  Have you? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=265.76s)]
*  We did. You know, I have to tell you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=267.44s)]
*  How many grains are there? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=269.84s)]
*  I start, we, I discovered the west of the Great Pyramid about 20 tombs. One of them [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=270.96s)]
*  mentioned in the Wad al-Jarif papyri that talking about building the pyramid by someone whose name [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=281.52s)]
*  was Mirar. We found the tombs of the pyramid builders at Giza. Big major important discovery. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=288.56s)]
*  We found the tombs in the upper cemetery for the technicians with titles in hieroglyphic. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  Each title has to do with building the pyramid, the lower cemetery for the workmen who move the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=304.64s)]
*  stones. And next to this, Mark Cleaner excavated an area for sorting salted fish, the bakery for [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=311.92s)]
*  making bread, the houses and the villages that the workmen lived. Then we do, I mean, I can't talk to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=321.76s)]
*  you. This is what I'm doing in the States now. This is top number 25 for me in my lecture in America [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=328.64s)]
*  that really I'm presenting to the people all the evidence that we do have to say that Khufu built [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=334.72s)]
*  this pyramid and this pyramid does not appear at once. No. But the key recent discovery that I [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=344.16s)]
*  believe you've made, that you've made public, is that it's always been traditionally assumed [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=353.68s)]
*  that the pyramids were built by 100,000 slaves. But you've done some research recently that you [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=359.04s)]
*  believe contradicts that theory. Your team unearthed tombs near the pyramids, you just touched on that, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=365.28s)]
*  that suggest they were in fact built by highly skilled paid laborers under a strict regime and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=372.08s)]
*  were not actually slaves because the slaves, you've argued, wouldn't have had formal burial [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=378.8s)]
*  in close proximity to the pyramid. So A, just explain that to me and B, explain [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=385.92s)]
*  why this is such a significant discovery in your opinion. Okay, when we discovered the tombs of the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=391.44s)]
*  pyramid builders, this discovery based on the names that we found inside the upper cemetery, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  I can tell you that pyramids were built by the ancient Egyptian because all the names that we [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  found were Egyptian names. The second important thing that they were no slaves. If they were [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=413.84s)]
*  slaves, the workmen will never be buried in the shadow of the pyramids. If they were slaves, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=420.32s)]
*  they will never prepare their tombs for eternity like kings and queens. I want to tell you one [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=427.52s)]
*  important thing. There is a big difference between slavery in America in the past and Europe and in [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=433.52s)]
*  Egypt. In America and Europe, you can own a person. In ancient Egypt, you can have a servant [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=440.88s)]
*  working for you because I found one tomb west of the great pyramid. It's for a priest. His name is [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=447.36s)]
*  Cai, and at the entrance of his tomb, he's saying the following, I built my tomb. I hired workmen, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=454.56s)]
*  sculptors and artisans. I paid them beer and bread. I made them to be happy. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=464.16s)]
*  And that's really an evidence to tell you that we have to understand the meaning of slavery [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  in ancient Egypt. There was no slavery in ancient Egypt. But that, I mean, it does seem to me, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  if you don't mind me saying, Dr. Hawass, you know, I listen, I bow to your far greater expertise than [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=484.64s)]
*  me. You've written a thousand page book on Giza alone. So, you know, I'm not going to try and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=491.2s)]
*  quibble with you about the history of the pyramids or anything. I would simply say it seems to me [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=497.76s)]
*  more logical, and correct me if I'm wrong here, more logical that, yes, I totally can see that a [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  lot of the local artisans and others will be brought in on this incredible project. But is it [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=510.24s)]
*  not really stretching credibility that they would not have also used what we would categorize as [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=517.04s)]
*  slaves in some capacity? Because the work was so onerous, so tough, so hard, and it would take [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=525.04s)]
*  a hundred thousand or more people. Were there really a hundred thousand artisans prepared to do [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=532.88s)]
*  that kind of heavy duty work, or is it not more likely that it was a mix of the two? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=538.88s)]
*  The number of the workmen that were involved in construction of the pyramid based on our excavation [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=543.6s)]
*  were only 10,000 workmen. And we have to understand that the Egyptians, before they began to build the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=553.2s)]
*  pyramid, they had to make a big type of administration to cut a canal, to cut the harbor, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=560.24s)]
*  for bringing stones from Aswan, from Torah, to set the workmen area. And this is why the 100,000 [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=569.44s)]
*  workmen were set by Herodotus, the father of the history, who came to Egypt in the middle of the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=576.48s)]
*  5th century B.C. And Herodotus used to hear from guides. There is not any evidence of the 100,000, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=583.0400000000001s)]
*  but we do believe, based on our work and our work on the discovery of the tombs of the pyramid [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=592.08s)]
*  builders and the workmen installation, that the workmen were only 10,000 workmen. But again, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=598.88s)]
*  I find that, again, I'm not questioning your research. I'm simply raising a quizzical eye. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=604.32s)]
*  For example, the World Cup football recently took place in Qatar. I went out there for it, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=610.4s)]
*  and they built a number of stadiums over a few years. But I think they had around 10,000 people [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=616.0s)]
*  building those football stadiums. There's no comparison in the complexity and size of these [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  stadiums to the pyramids, and they had all the benefit of modern technology to help them. So [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=630.96s)]
*  this idea that you could have the same number of people that built the World Cup stadiums for Qatar [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=636.32s)]
*  and you could do the pyramids with them back in ancient times, again, it doesn't seem plausible to me. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=643.0400000000001s)]
*  You've probably seen the viral videos of a North Korean phone that secretly takes screenshots [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=649.6s)]
*  every five minutes, which are only accessible by authorities. You probably thought it could [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=656.16s)]
*  never happen here. But your data is not as secure as you think. Data brokers monitor all online [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=661.28s)]
*  activity, what you click, what you buy, and who you talk to. It can be sold to advertisers or even [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=667.44s)]
*  scammers. Well, ExpressVPN is a powerful tool in your defense. It hides your IP address and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=674.16s)]

*  That's expressvpn.com slash peers. Now, one thing I want to tell you, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=708.0s)]
*  and this is what I'm saying always in my lectures, I'm saying if you stood in front of the Great [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=716.96s)]
*  Pyramid today and you look at it, you will never believe that any human being can build it. Why? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=723.04s)]
*  Because you don't know. And number two, we have to understand one thing, that the construction of [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=731.36s)]
*  the pyramid was a national project of the whole nation. The three millions who lived in Egypt in [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=739.36s)]
*  that time, in the time of Khufu, participated in building the pyramid, doing the king as a god. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=746.16s)]
*  Can you believe moving an obelisk from Aswan to Hatshepsut Temple? It took seven months. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=754.48s)]
*  It took seven months. And this can be depicted in the Temple of Hatshepsut, showing how they cut [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=762.8s)]
*  this obelisk, how they transported the obelisk on boats. It explained how they worked it for [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=769.36s)]
*  seven months because they want to make the king as a god. And this is why the households in upper [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=776.96s)]
*  and lower Egypt, all of them participated in sending workforce and food to help the king. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=784.48s)]
*  In return, they did not pay taxes. Then the organization of building the pyramid, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=792.32s)]
*  as we can see, the major problem that people look at Khufu pyramid only. They don't look [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=799.9200000000001s)]
*  what happened before and what happened after. If you see how they started, you see there is no gap [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=807.5200000000001s)]
*  in the Egyptian history at all to make anyone to think there is something we could argue about. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=816.16s)]
*  Okay, well look, before I bring in the other two panel members, I want to play you a clip. This is [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=824.0s)]
*  from when I had the world famous Graham Hancock on Uncensored who said this, what do you really [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=830.9599999999999s)]
*  want to achieve? What is the goal? Most of all, what I would like to achieve is for archaeologists [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=837.36s)]
*  to engage with my work without smearing me, without calling me a racist and a white supremacist [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=843.04s)]
*  and a misogynist and an anti-semite. All of these words were applied to me. So I guess my question [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=849.1999999999999s)]
*  there, Dr Hawass, is do you have an objection to people like Graham Hancock having their own [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=855.8399999999999s)]
*  theories about the pyramids because they're not actually from the Middle East because they're [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=863.04s)]
*  white guys from England? At all. First, you have to understand that Egyptology, you have hundreds of [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=868.72s)]
*  American Egyptologists and French and German who are not only the Egyptian Egyptologists. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=880.08s)]
*  And by the way, I debated Graham Hancock and John Antony West and Reba Bofall many times in many [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=886.56s)]
*  places. I met Graham in Egypt. I invited him for dinner and I talked to him and I asked [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=894.24s)]
*  Graham all the time, if you do have evidence of what you believe on the date of the pyramids [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=901.28s)]
*  and moving stones, you don't have any evidence. If he gives me one single evidence, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=908.5600000000001s)]
*  I will accept that. You know, I won't tell you about moving stones. We do have a scene from the [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=915.44s)]
*  Old Kingdom talking about moving stones. In the Middle Kingdom, a statue, 60 tons, 170 Egyptians [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=921.92s)]
*  dragging the statue. The Hatshepsut obelisk, all this can tell us how the Egyptians move the stones. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=931.5999999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you, before I get, before I get, let me ask you, why do we not, given we've got technology [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=936.56s)]
*  these days which can go incredibly deep, why don't we just go under the pyramids and go right deep, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=942.3199999999999s)]
*  right down and really get to the bottom of this? What's the objection to doing that? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=948.48s)]
*  I don't, but I have to understand we are working right now to measure expeditions, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=954.64s)]
*  one from England working under me and one called Scan Pyramids. We are using the most sophisticated [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=960.48s)]
*  techniques to understand and to discover the volleys, discoveries that we've done until now, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=967.9200000000001s)]
*  many of it, and there is others we'll reveal later. Then we are not objecting, but what, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=977.1999999999999s)]
*  who should work in the pyramids? You have to bring scientists from a museum, from a university, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=984.7199999999999s)]
*  but you cannot bring an amateur from New York or London to come and work in scientific. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=990.3199999999999s)]
*  Okay, well that's quite interesting because what they say of course is that it's a bit of a carve [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=996.0s)]
*  up and that you guys are the pyramid establishment and you don't like outsiders because you don't [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1001.44s)]
*  want them contradicting your narrative. So let's bring in the other two guests, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  joining us now are two independent researchers and investigators of lost ancient history, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1010.88s)]
*  Jimmy Corsetti, the host of the Bright Insight YouTube channel, and from the debunking channel, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1015.84s)]
*  Dan Richards. Welcome to both of you, we've had you both on before of course. Jimmy Corsetti, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1020.48s)]
*  what would you like to say to Dr Harwats about his recent revelation from his team's research [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1026.24s)]
*  that they believe the pyramids were not built by slaves and there were 100,000, there were about [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1032.64s)]
*  10,000 and they were artisans at the time. To be honest, well let me first say, Piers, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1038.56s)]
*  thank you for having me back on and Zahi, it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1045.76s)]
*  There's a few things I take issue with with what he had said. First of all, this scan pyramids [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1049.6s)]
*  project, that initial discovery was back in 2016 and it was corroborated into a published study in [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1055.04s)]
*  2017. Well when you look from 2016 to 2025, that's nine years ago, that's almost a decade and I'm [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1060.96s)]
*  trying to understand why we wouldn't have drilled a half inch diameter hole and sent in a endoscope [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1068.24s)]
*  camera into this hidden chamber because let's not forget that the Great Pyramid of Giza is arguably [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1074.1599999999999s)]
*  the most mysterious and debated structure in all of human history. We don't know exactly how it was [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1079.44s)]
*  constructed and in fact how it was constructed is one of the most debated topics. Another debated [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1084.8s)]
*  topic is whether it was actually built to be a tomb for the pharaohs because after all we never [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1089.6s)]
*  found any mummy in any Egyptian pyramid ever. So with those two significant points of debate, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1093.9199999999998s)]
*  we could squash those debates by simply going in and exploring it. So I guess I have a question [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1100.56s)]
*  for Dr. Hawass at this time which is why haven't we drilled into that hidden chamber? When will we [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1105.28s)]
*  do it? And the third question is has it already been done so in secret? Wow, great questions. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1111.6s)]
*  All right Dr. Hawass, your response. Now number one, you have to understand until today, today [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1118.7199999999998s)]
*  is in July 2025, we still have the scan pyramid team are working. You know that they found behind [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1129.04s)]
*  the main entrance the corridor and they found above the grand gallery the big void and the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1142.48s)]
*  Egyptian team, the English team that working under me, they found some important voids [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1149.92s)]
*  and you have to be patient, you have to study how are you going to drill or the new techniques [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1159.04s)]
*  that they're using, the new techniques that they're using like ultrasound and infrared [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1168.08s)]
*  penetrating radar, all of this you do not need to drill anymore. You can see what's behind a wall [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1175.92s)]
*  because the English team from London and Sean who's working for me, they found a void behind [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1184.08s)]
*  the northern entrance of the Queenie Chamber with hieroglyphic signs. We are studying now how can we [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1193.36s)]
*  approach all these voids but you have to understand one thing, we are not making anything secret. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1202.72s)]
*  We advertise everything that we discover, we found above the Kingie Chamber in the five [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1209.2800000000002s)]
*  chambers, relieving chambers, two more names of the gangists who built the pyramids and we found [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1216.88s)]
*  year 13 of Kofuz Reyn and this is what I'm talking about in my lecture in the States now. This is my [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1223.2s)]
*  number 25 lecture that I am publishing, announcing to the public everything that we discover [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1230.16s)]
*  inside the great pyramid. Nothing is secret. Okay, well that's good to have that clarified. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1238.72s)]
*  If you're stressed about back taxes, miss the April deadline or your books are a mess, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1246.0s)]
*  well don't wait, the IRS is cracking down. Penalties add up fast, 5 per cent per month and up to 25 [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1250.4s)]
*  per cent for not filing. Tax Network USA can help. They've assisted thousands of Americans from [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1257.36s)]
*  employees to business owners and people who haven't filed for years. They have direct access to [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1262.8s)]
*  powerful IRS programs and expert negotiators on your side. Tax Network USA knows how to win. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1268.24s)]
*  You'll get a free consultation and they may even be able to reduce or eliminate what you owe. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1274.6399999999999s)]
*  Don't wait for the next IRS letter. Call 800 958 1000 or visit tnusa.com [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1279.28s)]
*  slash peers. That's tnusa.com slash peers for expert help on your taxes. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1287.68s)]
*  Can I just ask you just on a personal level about one thing that's constantly put out there as to [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1294.96s)]
*  whether you believe this is true. That the great pyramid of Giza is claimed to have a correlation [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1301.1200000000001s)]
*  with the earth's circumference and polar radius based on the idea that multiplying the pyramid's [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1307.2s)]
*  perimeter by 43,200 equals the earth's equatorial circumference and multiplying its height by 43,200 [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1313.2s)]
*  equals the earth's polar radius so that this number 43,200 is also related to the procession [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1324.32s)]
*  of the earth's axis. Is that all true? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1333.4399999999998s)]
*  You know I'm not objecting any theory but you have to understand every day I hear a theory [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1338.1599999999999s)]
*  about a pyramid. Sometimes I answer that one. That one is an amazing theory. If that theory is true [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1345.12s)]
*  it is mind-blowing. Do you think it's true? No one sent it to me. I will study it and I will [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1351.6s)]
*  I mean you've not heard it. It's the same number on the Sumerian king's list. 43,200 has been seen [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1359.2s)]
*  in ancient history inexplicably and the Sumerians are the earliest document human civilization we [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1364.24s)]
*  have and that number ties in with them. Real quick I'm sorry but Zahi you didn't answer my [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1369.44s)]
*  prior question. Have you guys gone in and explored that hidden chamber and if not when will you be [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1373.6000000000001s)]
*  doing so because to be honest we could do it by the end of the weekend. It's not difficult to drill [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1379.1200000000001s)]
*  a half inch diameter hole and send in endoscope here. So have we been in there and if not when [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1383.1200000000001s)]
*  are we going brother? I need to know. This will answer all of our questions. If you want to squash [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1387.12s)]
*  debate involving you know conspiracy theorists and everything all we got to do is go in and look. We [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1391.28s)]
*  know where it's at. We could drill a hole. This is doable. Yeah I agree. Why can't you just go in? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1396.0s)]
*  I answered your question and I said you're saying we have not gone in and explored that chamber. Is [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1403.1999999999998s)]
*  that correct? Can you please let me to answer you? Yes. I already answered you and I said [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1408.3999999999999s)]
*  all these voids that we found the scan pyramid team and the English team right now we are discussing [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1416.8s)]
*  and studying how we are going to get in. You cannot just go in directly like this. You have [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1426.3999999999999s)]
*  to make a study. You have to research it. You have to decide as a scientist when can you do it and [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1433.84s)]
*  when we can do that we can. It's been nine years. We have sent rockets to the moon since the 60s. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1440.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean the idea we can get to the moon in space rockets but we can't get inside a chamber of a [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1451.52s)]
*  tomb in a pyramid. I mean come on. Do you want me to answer now or still any talk? I told you [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1458.32s)]
*  what we found inside the Great Pyramid and I told you this year 2025 is the year that we are [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1467.44s)]
*  studying how can we enter inside these voids and he said nine years. Yes it can take more than nine [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1475.6000000000001s)]
*  years. This is the pyramid of Egypt. This is something valuable. This is one of the seven [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1482.96s)]
*  wonders of the world. You just can go and boom and a drill like this. You have to be sure that [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1488.5600000000002s)]
*  this drill is important to discover something. That is not nine years. We have been working [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1494.0s)]
*  since nine years until today. I hear you. Let me bring in Dan Richards. Dan what would you like to [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1500.32s)]
*  say to Dr Awos because there is obviously there's been a kind of raging conflict between [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1505.6s)]
*  what people see as the establishment of geologists who have kind of access and control and then all [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1511.44s)]
*  you guys who would probably love to get that kind of access and control but don't have it. What do [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1518.56s)]
*  you view about what he's been saying? Well first of all thank you for having me, Peres. It's good [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1523.36s)]
*  to meet you Zahi. I have a quick, when you were on Joe Rogan you said that you didn't know what [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1529.36s)]
*  Zeptepi was and I figured I would give you a chance. I would imagine as the premier [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1535.76s)]
*  Egyptologist in the world you do know the Egyptian creation myth. Would you mind just explaining it [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1540.32s)]
*  to us real quick so that to kind of vindicate yourself and show the world you do know what [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1545.04s)]
*  Zeptepi is? No, I mean I know about the ancient Egyptian creation but maybe I don't know this [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1549.36s)]
*  term but what I'm saying what this has to do with what we are discussing now. Oh it's very important [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1558.1599999999999s)]
*  because I mean it's the ancient Egyptian creation myth involves the primeval mound right and this [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1565.1999999999998s)]
*  is a symbolic thing. Exactly. This is something you're going to see all over the ancient world so [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1571.6799999999998s)]
*  that terms that Zeptepi is you see it in Egyptian without the vowels but it is the Egyptian creation [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1577.1200000000001s)]
*  myth so it's kind of important it's a very important lens to use when you're interpreting [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1586.0s)]
*  these artifacts so when you were on Joe Rogan and he asked you what it was and you said you [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1591.1200000000001s)]
*  didn't know what it was that so honestly if you didn't wouldn't mind it's a chance to vindicate [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1594.8s)]
*  yourself and no I teach the Egyptian creation but I'm saying this term that you're talking about [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1600.08s)]
*  I never heard of it maybe I never heard it in the world of Egyptian policy maybe it's between [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1608.24s)]
*  the others but I can tell you about creation how the Egyptian created this world but I don't [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1615.12s)]
*  understand why this has to do with the pyramid now that we're discussing it. Well let me ask [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1621.76s)]
*  Dan let me ask you just on the wider point of the recent discovery by Dr Harwas or the claim [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1627.52s)]
*  from the research that there were no slaves involved in the building of the pyramids. To me [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1634.56s)]
*  that's ludicrous I mean I worked construction for a long time and they're using the food and the [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1640.8s)]
*  graves and stuff and I mean I saw many in construction workers eating McDonald's while [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1644.8799999999999s)]
*  there was other construction workers eating steak it just depends on if he's a foreman if he's an [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1649.44s)]
*  engineer or if he's just a grunt the painters don't eat as good as the electricians who don't [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1654.24s)]
*  eat as good as the engineers and the architects so you know having 10,000 people buried in the [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1658.56s)]
*  shade of the pyramid in a grave mind you that only says they worked for true food it never says that [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1664.48s)]
*  they built the pyramids so that's that's a stretch it's an assumption that these are pyramid builder [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1670.32s)]
*  graves but in addition to that that could be graves of tens of thousands of slaves off the site that [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1674.96s)]
*  haven't been discovered that were doing all of the grunt work while somebody else was holding the [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1680.56s)]
*  plumb bob so to me to me it's ludicrous to say there were no slaves involved but but to be clear [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1684.8799999999999s)]
*  and to be fair to Dr Harwas you don't know for a fact that this is not true do you what are you [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1690.72s)]
*  saying of course not that's that's I mean that's ancient history right we we we can all we can all [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1695.9199999999998s)]
*  speculate we can all spitball but the only things we really know are carbon dating and written [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1700.3999999999999s)]
*  records kind of sort of but I mean we fudge written records all the time even today so [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1706.0s)]
*  all right Jimmy you you raised your hand I completely agree with everything that Dan just [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1710.48s)]
*  said however it's something very important for all of us to be humbled by is the fact that the [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1715.68s)]
*  great pyramids of Giza were allegedly created by the old kingdom and there's a few things that need [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1720.24s)]
*  to be considered when we discuss what we think we know and what we don't know about the pyramids [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1725.6000000000001s)]
*  construction which is that after the pyramids construction there was three other changes of [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1730.0s)]
*  kingdom within Egypt old kingdom middle kingdom new kingdom and between them are missing chapters [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1735.04s)]
*  of human history within Egypt for example between the old kingdom and the middle kingdom is [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1741.04s)]
*  approximately 126 years of completely missing history it's conjecture we think that it may [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1746.64s)]
*  have been a revolt within Egypt a civil war but something happened to completely overthrow the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1752.16s)]
*  fourth dynasty going into the fifth dynasty and then between the middle kingdom and the new kingdom [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1756.96s)]
*  is approximately 186 years of missing history so the point that I'm making is that within each of [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1761.44s)]
*  those two chapters of missing history that's longer than any human lifespan it's multiple [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1766.64s)]
*  generations which means that nobody was alive afterwards to say what was happening before we [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1772.16s)]
*  have absolutely no idea how the pyramids were constructed how or even precisely when and actually [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1778.0s)]
*  I should point out that Zahi you mentioned about the movement of stones and you were cited that 60 [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1783.28s)]
*  tons stone that the depicts being moved on a wooden sledge well that is only 60 tons whereas [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1788.08s)]
*  the Egyptians had moved the 1000 metric ton ramecium statue 1000 metric tons is well over [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1794.1599999999999s)]
*  2.2 million pounds and it was inexplicably moved approximately 170 miles from aswan to luxor that [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1800.6399999999999s)]
*  is 17 times heavier than that statue that you repeatedly cite not one not twice as heavy not [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1808.08s)]
*  five times as heavy not ten times as heavy 17 times heavier and I'm not are we to pretend that [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1815.6s)]
*  wooden sleds are infinitely scalable the reality is that there is a mystery here we don't know how [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1822.32s)]
*  they constructed the pyramids we don't know how they lifted and stacked 80 ton stones 300 feet [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1827.6s)]
*  above the ground and again I just would like your clarification are you saying that there has been [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1832.6399999999999s)]
*  no exploration into any of those hidden voids yet above the grand gallery are you can you tell me [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1837.6799999999998s)]
*  in good faith that you're certain that nobody within the egypt ministry of antiquities have [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1843.2s)]
*  has explored that yet okay well a lot to unpack there so first of all yes or no zahi sorry piers [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1847.76s)]
*  dr hawaz answer that last question definitively you know you've been asked it directly are you [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1853.92s)]
*  saying on the record there has been no explanation exploration in the way that jimmy corsetti says [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1860.32s)]
*  Jimmy I want you to understand this conspiracy theory that you do have is wrong completely we [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1866.72s)]
*  do not hide anything if the egyptian listen if we do have any evidence that pyramids are back [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1877.44s)]
*  15 000 years old what's wrong with this we'll announce this we are not against anything but [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1885.3600000000001s)]
*  what I am saying we are not hiding anything and you have to know this your theory that we have [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1893.84s)]
*  something that will hide is not true always any discovery and any excavation [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1903.04s)]
*  hang on what about the second point that jimmy made which is surrounding the ramessian which was [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1915.4399999999998s)]
*  a thousand tons how did that get moved you know i one thing we have i can give you three evidence [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1922.0s)]
*  of moving stones we have the wazil jarf babayri do you know anything about this papyri [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1932.64s)]
*  the babayri is talking about i'm sure they do i don't see the workman who wanted to cut the white [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1939.6000000000001s)]
*  fine limestone for the casing of the pyramid and he talked about his boss stones [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1946.24s)]
*  his name is diddy those stones are like we found these times at the most you have in the middle [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1950.96s)]
*  kingdom and by the way when it comes to that papyri she keeps moving it says absolutely the word [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1955.0400000000002s)]
*  pyramid is not mentioned one single time answer you do not i gave you the time to talk give me [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1960.72s)]

*  about exploring you didn't say yes or no you said there's no secrets but yes or no have you been in [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1973.76s)]
*  there i told you we are we are talking now we are searching now we are discussing now how how can [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1978.96s)]
*  we enter this void then we know that that's had the voids but have you done it yet no we i told [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=1991.9199999999998s)]

*  the year we are going to show all the voids inside the pyramid all right let me ask you [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2009.28s)]
*  don't tell how let me ask you what is the one thing you are desperate to discover about the [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2015.2s)]
*  pyramids which which you've never been able to answer yourself number one i want to tell jimmy [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2022.24s)]
*  that we found all the evidence of how the great pyramid was built completely no we don't really [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2030.0s)]
*  have explained how they lifted and stacked 80 tons stones 300 feet above the ground and but and prior [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2037.44s)]
*  to that they were no we know we have miles we have we have it shown we have it shown in scenes in [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2042.6399999999999s)]
*  tombs in the middle kingdom and the new kingdom it's not the old kingdom you have to go and read [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2047.92s)]
*  you have to go and read about this but number two which too what do you know that that's not true but [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2052.48s)]
*  i know that that's not true so for the audience once you site once you can google it upon herself [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2058.24s)]
*  tomb of the hut the tomb of the hut it shows 172 men are moving a 60 tons a statue then what's what's [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2062.7999999999997s)]
*  your problem i don't understand less weight than the ramecium statue how do you move a thousand tons [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2077.2799999999997s)]
*  uh stone like you said how do you do that do you know i want to show you today our workmen today [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2082.64s)]

*  is in the old kingdom there's absolutely no documentation of any kind describing how the [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2107.2799999999997s)]
*  pyramids were constructed again there's missing history that happened right after you are wrong [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2111.68s)]
*  out of the 100,000 hieroglyphs in egypt there's not one single one that depicts or otherwise [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2116.96s)]
*  describes in any capacity the construction of the pyramids and again that diary that you keep citing [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2121.2799999999997s)]
*  actually doesn't include the word pyramid whatsoever just like dan richards had just said it's an [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2126.96s)]
*  assumption you know zai if you would like to invite me out to show me you know the exploration of this [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2131.04s)]
*  hidden void i think it'd be very good for the influence of the various influencers within this [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2135.9199999999996s)]
*  community on the internet that are concerned that things have not been shared on the up and [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2140.96s)]
*  i'd actually like to come like you i'd like to come as the impartial guide on that trip actually [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2145.28s)]
*  let me bring dan back in dan out of interest the same question to you [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2152.96s)]
*  dan hang on one sec dr howarth dan uh richards what is the thing you would most like to just [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2156.64s)]
*  know for sure about the pyramid honestly as a guy who's worked construction a lot there's one of the [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2164.08s)]
*  questions that that are unanswered about the construction of the pyramids you can say that [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2169.44s)]
*  you know how they've lifted the stones all you want but the squaring of that edifice to itself [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2173.84s)]
*  the great pyramid has about a two inch deviation on a 756 foot run that's less than a thousandth of a [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2178.64s)]
*  percent you can't do that with ropes because they're going to sag you can't do it with putting [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2184.96s)]
*  sticks back to back because you're going to get errors nowadays we use transits and lasers um [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2189.92s)]
*  you know 500 years ago they built the observatory at grenich and it's not remotely as accurate to [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2196.48s)]
*  itself as the great pyramid so honestly i would just like to know how the hell they got it so [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2202.4s)]
*  perfectly accurate in its own footprint how did you how do they square something on that size it's [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2207.04s)]
*  it's like machine age machine age accuracy on a gigantic scale so do you have any idea how they [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2211.84s)]
*  squared the edifice dr hawass did you go to the shore to see the pyramids of kufu's father [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2218.72s)]
*  no i have not been to egypt but i i'm aware of the pyramids if you have not if you haven't been in [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2227.6s)]
*  egypt how can you based on what you see because you have to know one thing when the egyptian [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2234.08s)]
*  began to think about building kufu pyramid you have to know they choose giza plateau [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2241.3599999999997s)]
*  because giza plateau is a part of the mokattam formation level one and two are very bad stones [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2248.08s)]
*  but level three has the best quality of the pyramid came 1 000 feet away from the base of [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2254.08s)]
*  kufu pyramid and we located the location of the quarry but before they moved the stones they had [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2264.08s)]
*  to cut in the solid rock until they made the base of the pyramid [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2271.2s)]
*  meters of solid rock no stones and they established a ramp from the quarry to the south [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2276.7999999999997s)]
*  west corner the ramp was constructed of a stone rubble and sand and we excavated the route of this [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2284.56s)]
*  ramp and we found it then the egyptian had a team cut it sorry can i i'm sorry yes go ahead [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2291.92s)]
*  the egyptian divided the workmen as we hear from wad al-jarfi babayri that i would like jimmy [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2303.76s)]
*  to read first before he can talk to me the wad al-jarfi babayri i've been there three times don't [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2310.88s)]
*  come at me like that i've been to giza three times i loved it and i would love to go out there with [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2316.32s)]
*  you i sincerely mean that i know it sounds like i'm sharp shooting you but i'm talking about the [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2320.32s)]
*  wad al-jarfi papayri you have to read it and it says what it doesn't say anything it doesn't say [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2325.84s)]
*  anything about on the constructed the pyramids i'm talking about the accuracy the square the square [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2333.84s)]
*  how you how they made it so square it's extremely perfect and it's the kind of thing that we can't [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2338.56s)]
*  do today without lasers we don't do it you can't do it with ropes you can't do it with sticks [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2344.56s)]
*  so what what there's a mystery there what's your conclusion no i need to understand my my my my [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2349.6s)]
*  honestly what do you want to say my conclusion is they use you know the plates that the plate [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2355.44s)]
*  with many rings like a target that you have in the museum in tyro um i believe that that was a [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2359.84s)]
*  target that they used a concave mirror and used a the pinpoint of light to fill up circles at [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2365.92s)]
*  different distances i haven't been able to test that but that's they had to use something more [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2371.2s)]
*  than ropes because you can't get that kind of accuracy without it's something without something [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2376.16s)]
*  better i'm trying to keep it low tech again my question what is your conclusion if the [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2380.0s)]
*  egyptians did not do this who did it in your opinion i i'm not saying the egyptians didn't [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2388.16s)]
*  do it i'm talking about specific problems and how to solve them i don't care i don't care if gandhi [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2392.7999999999997s)]
*  did it i'm talking about how to get squared and so i'm trying to answer that without going to lasers [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2397.8399999999997s)]
*  or ancient high tech but um but but honestly the issue here that as i see it is you're telling me [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2403.2s)]
*  that the problem solved i'm telling you that if i was tasked with doing that as a guy who's been [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2409.52s)]
*  tasked with pouring foundations i couldn't do that i would be looking at it going i'm going to need [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2413.7599999999998s)]
*  better tools than what you had could it be could it be that they were just better than a construction [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2418.24s)]
*  than we are now well you're talking about a margin of error so i mean you're you still have to figure [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2425.9199999999996s)]
*  out how they would how they measured that's i mean there were geniuses all over the place in [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2431.36s)]
*  in that period of absolutely of the history of the planet you know i mean why couldn't they just have [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2436.32s)]
*  had construction geniuses who bereft of things like lasers had to come up with other brilliant [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2440.7200000000003s)]
*  ideas to do i mean look somebody somebody built this right somebody built this i have to assume [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2446.88s)]
*  they were humans it's most likely they were egyptian humans so we should be able to agree [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2453.04s)]
*  on those broad parameters the fascinating thing about the pyramids is we just don't really know [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2458.88s)]
*  how they did it and i hope and it exceeds the known capabilities of the dynastic egyptians [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2464.4s)]
*  yeah well what's that sorry it it what the pyramids themselves exceed the known capabilities of the [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2469.2000000000003s)]
*  night right which is so that's what makes it so fascinating and look we've run out of time i could [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2475.44s)]
*  talk about this for hours i've become a a real egypt pyramid nerd because of this but i actually [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2479.92s)]
*  love your idea jimmy that we all go out to the pyramids uh maybe at the moment you get inside [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3EBcvP88ys&t=2485.52s)]
