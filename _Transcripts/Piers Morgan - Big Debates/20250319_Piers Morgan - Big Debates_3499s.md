Video Description: The enduring accusations of President Donald Trump’s supposed collusion with Russia used to be a stain on the reputations of Republicans who backed him, but more and more, it is the Democrats who desperately want the story to die. 

Unfortunately for them, that just isn’t happening. Tonight, one of the chief reasons for the accusations, former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, appears on Uncensored to face his extremely passionate detractors. Then, Piers Morgan debates the eye-watering decline of Tesla stock prices and the broken ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

Joining Piers for these debates are co-host of 'The Rest Is Politics' and former communication director under Trump Anthony Scaramucci, host of 'Social Contract with Joe Walsh' and former Presidential candidate Joe Walsh, co-host of 'Steve Bannon's War Room' Natalie Winters, author of 'Provoked: How Washington Started the New Cold War with Russia and the Catastrophe in Ukraine' Scott Horton.

# "Trump Will Do Whatever Putin Wants!" Feat: Russiagate Chris Steele vs MAGA
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE)
*  Your dossier caused a firestorm, obviously, when it came out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=0.0s)]
*  The Russians may have held blackmail video of Trump engaged in, you know, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=4.0s)]
*  very unsavory activity with prostitutes and so on, which he's emphatically denied, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=9.36s)]
*  and for which no other evidence has ever emerged. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=13.76s)]
*  And if it hadn't have been for Mr. Steele, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=16.72s)]
*  then Trump would have been able to solve the problem in Ukraine then. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=18.88s)]
*  This liar framed him essentially for treason. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=22.56s)]
*  I'm amazed that this guy is willing to show his face in public right now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=26.16s)]
*  I really think that you represent probably the ultimate grifter in the American political space. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=29.76s)]
*  Shame on you for the last decade trying to inject the idea that smearing President Trump [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=35.36s)]
*  as a Russian agent or a Russian asset is somehow going to take the MAGA movement. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=40.24s)]
*  Elon Musk's SpaceX rescued stricken astronauts from outer space as protesters attacked Tesla's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  and the court's battle doge here on planet Earth. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=52.8s)]
*  Israel launches a brutal assault on Gaza as the US broken ceasefire collapses. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=56.0s)]
*  So plenty to debate, but we begin with a fragile breakthrough in Ukraine. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=60.64s)]
*  You may not have enjoyed the way President Trump has gone about forcing an end to the war. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=64.4s)]
*  You may not think it's fair that Ukraine will lose whole chunks of its country [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=68.0s)]
*  in any final settlement, although Putin has been brought to the table without any [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=72.4s)]
*  repercussions for his war crimes. I don't think any of that is fair either. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  But the brutal truth is that the war must end, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=80.16s)]
*  and the president's marathon phone call with the Russian dictator, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=82.64s)]
*  which has now been followed by another long call with President Zelensky today, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=85.84s)]
*  has brought that one small tentative step closer to reality. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=89.68s)]
*  The second brutal truth is that the Biden administration had no plan to end the war. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=93.28s)]
*  Their strategy was to give Ukraine just enough to survive, but never enough to win. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  The obvious result was a forever war costing billions of dollars and thousands of lives. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=102.56s)]
*  Something had to break the deadlock. Trump said he would, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=107.6s)]
*  and now he appears to be doing just that. You can give credit for that while reserving judgment [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=110.8s)]
*  on what happens next. But Trump's critics can't see past the narrative that he is Putin's puppet. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=115.28s)]
*  For the vast majority of his first presidency, the biggest story in U.S. politics was Russiagate, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=121.12s)]
*  the story that Trump colluded with the Kremlin to win power. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=125.44s)]
*  As claim after claim was disproven, critics shifted to the argument that Trump dislikes [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=128.24s)]
*  Putin more. It came up again in his interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News last night. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=132.4s)]
*  The criticism that you've heard since really 2015 is that you have more in common with Vladimir Putin [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=136.56s)]
*  than you do with globalist leaders, maybe some NATO leaders, and in this case with Zelensky. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=144.8s)]
*  You're both nationalists. Zelensky is more of a globalist. How do you respond to that criticism? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=151.36s)]
*  Well, I am a nationalist, but I'm a nationalist for the United States, not for anybody else. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=157.28s)]
*  And it's interesting because there's nobody been tougher on Russia than me. I'm the one that pointed [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=162.96s)]
*  out Nord Stream 2, and I stopped it. Nord Stream is the biggest pipeline, I guess, in the world, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=167.6s)]
*  taking care of all of Europe. And it was being built from before I got there. And somehow they [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=172.4s)]
*  were on the way. It was going to be... And I stopped it. It was just stone cold dead. I stopped it in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=179.6s)]
*  its tracks. Well, that is true. It's also true that Russia's invasion of Georgia, Russia's first [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=185.68s)]
*  occupation of eastern Ukraine, Russia's annexing of Crimea and Russia's full-scale invasion all [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  took place with a Democrat in the White House. And what about the whole big idea that Russia is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  Europe's problem to solve? This apparently dramatic shift in US foreign policy that has [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=199.76s)]
*  torched historic alliances. Well, that all began with this guy. Because a few months ago when you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=204.16s)]
*  were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia. Not Al-Qaeda, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=209.6s)]
*  you said Russia. And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=215.04s)]
*  the Cold War has been over for 20 years. Well, to be fair, that was before Russian troops invaded [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=220.88s)]
*  and seized Crimea. So here's President Obama speaking a few weeks after that. The point is that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=225.84s)]
*  there are always going to be bad things that happen around the world. With respect to Mr [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  Romney's assertion that Russia is our number one geopolitical foe, the truth of the matter is that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=239.12s)]
*  America's got a whole lot of challenges. Russia is a regional power. Russia's actions are a problem. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=248.4s)]
*  They don't pose the number one national security threat to the United States. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=258.48s)]
*  A regional European problem, not America's biggest concern. Sounds an awful lot like [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=263.92s)]
*  America First to me. Well, joining me now are the co-hosts of The Rest Is Politics and former [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=269.20000000000005s)]
*  communication director under Donald Trump, Anthony Scaramucci, the host of Social Contract [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=273.6s)]
*  with Joe Walsh and former presidential candidate Joe Walsh, the co-host of Steve Bannon's War Room, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  Natalie Winters, and the author of Provoked, How Washington Started the New Cold War With Russia [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=282.48s)]
*  and the catastrophe in Ukraine, Scott Horton, and the former MI6 officer and author of The Steel [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  dossier, Christopher Steele, also joins us. So thank you to all of you for joining today. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=293.04s)]
*  Anthony Scaramucci, great to have you back on Uncensored. I've just written a column for [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  The Spectator magazine here in the UK and I've said that amid all the mayhem, the squealing, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=303.92s)]
*  the banshee shrieking that goes around whenever Trump opens his mouth, the hysteria in many ways, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=312.0s)]
*  I do see a certain cold, calculated method to the madness. I see somebody who campaigned that he [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=318.64s)]
*  would end these two wars, who is, it seems to me, edging nearer to doing that than his predecessor. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=326.88s)]
*  Somebody who said he'd sort the problem out on the southern border seems to have done that almost [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=334.16s)]
*  immediately. Somebody who said he'd fix America's structural economic problems and although it's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=338.24s)]
*  obviously very turbulent right now, when the country is so riddled with debt, something has [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=345.04s)]
*  to be done and my bet is this might, over time, work better than doing nothing. My point being [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=351.52s)]
*  that sometimes you have to cut through all the hysteria with Donald Trump and you know him as [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=359.04s)]
*  well as anyone and just focus on what he actually does and give it a bit of time to see if it [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=363.04s)]
*  works. Am I being naive? Listen, you're being very generous. I guess what I would say to you is that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=368.16s)]
*  Russia does not want to feel like a regional power even if it is a regional power and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=378.88000000000005s)]
*  I was with President Trump in December of 2016 when Dr. Kissinger was in the room with him and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=383.68s)]
*  he told Dr. Kissinger told President Trump to treat Putin like a superpower and you'll get more [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=389.68s)]
*  out of him. So I'll continue your line of generosity with the president but we have Christopher [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=398.56s)]
*  Steele on. I've read his book Unredacted. There's evidence that suggests that there's a tie there [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=404.32s)]
*  and so we couldn't figure it out in the White House. McMaster couldn't figure it out. If you [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=410.64s)]
*  bring him on he can't answer for it but McMaster, General McMaster went on Fox News yesterday [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=414.88s)]
*  because he knows Donald Trump, President Trump watches Fox News and he says look he's going to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=421.52s)]
*  do whatever Putin wants him to do and I find that hard for me. We still live in a very powerful [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=426.24s)]
*  country with the most powerful military and the Russian economy is crippled and the flex on [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=432.96s)]
*  President Trump I don't get. He's showing naked pictures on state television the evening of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=440.72s)]
*  President Trump's reassent to the presidency. He blows them off for an hour. It puts him on hold [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=445.68s)]
*  basically for the call and so I guess I would push back to you and the other panelists and I would [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=451.36s)]
*  say you know what is all of that about because when the windows open Pierce and you hear Clippity [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=456.8s)]
*  clop it's a horse. It's not a zebra. There's something going on. I don't know exactly what [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=461.36s)]
*  it is. Maybe Christopher Steele does but there's something going on. I would like you as a great [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=467.28s)]
*  journalist and an investigative reporter. Let's get to the bottom of it. Well you know what I think. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  I think look I think the first two years of his first term everybody tried to get to the bottom [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=477.28s)]
*  of it and ultimately the conclusion, the official conclusion was that it was pretty much a gigantic [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  nothing burger. I will come to Christopher Steele in a moment but you know certainly there was no [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  hard evidence that was established beyond any reasonable doubt that the Kremlin had helped Trump [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=493.44s)]
*  fix that election win and the problem with that it seemed to me was that because the Russia [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=499.2s)]
*  collusion narrative was taken by the mainstream media and run so aggressively for two years pretty [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=504.4s)]
*  much 24-7 that when it turned out not to be as they had said I think there's a huge breach of [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=510.24s)]
*  trust with the American people and outside of America but with the American people where people [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=516.72s)]
*  were like you know what if that isn't true after all you've been saying for two years if that just [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=521.6s)]
*  isn't fundamentally true then what else can I believe so we're now in a position where it's all [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=528.08s)]
*  it's all. Pierce you gotta give me a chance to respond before the other panelists. Yeah. See [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=533.36s)]
*  there's no there was no collusion listen I sat in those things by the way I told I told people in [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=538.32s)]
*  the congress we weren't even colluding with ourselves on the campaign how the hell were we [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=543.36s)]
*  colluding with the Russians so there was no collusion and that was a specious wrong rabbit [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=547.52s)]
*  hole to go down. I'm more talking about the tie between President Putin and President Trump [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  the oligarch tie the fact that the the boys Don Jr. Eric Trump they said that their money came from [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=558.72s)]
*  Russia they said that in 2013 14 and 15 they then changed the tune when their dad was running for [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=566.96s)]
*  president so I'm not talking about the collusion issue you're right about that and they ran down [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=574.4000000000001s)]
*  the wrong rabbit hole and I think that put up a bigger smoke screen about the underlying Putin [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=578.96s)]

*  other figures around him particularly Manafort who was the head of his campaign and I think the idea [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=694.96s)]
*  that Manafort and Kalymnik if you remember the the Russian intelligence officer who he worked [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=700.88s)]
*  with in Ukraine weren't involved in some kind of cooperation or collusion in 2016 is for the birds [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=705.6s)]
*  I mean I think it's very clear that Manafort was probably trading campaign data and so on with [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=712.32s)]
*  Kalymnik and in fact came back soon after the election I think in the transition period [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=718.16s)]
*  with a very sort of pro-Russian Ukrainian peace plan as he called it which he presented to Trump [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=723.52s)]
*  there was also of course all the links between Mike Flynn and the Russian ambassador [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  in the transitional period and if you go back before that way back to 2008 when Trump sold [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=733.84s)]
*  one of his properties in sunny arse Florida to a Russian oligarch for assessed to be double the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=740.96s)]
*  money that it was worth and that got Trump out of a difficulty in paying back and avoiding [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=746.8s)]
*  avoiding bankruptcy I believe at the time Michael Cohen said that Trump had commented to him that [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=752.24s)]
*  he was indebted to to Putin for getting him off that hook so I think there's a lot there [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=759.12s)]
*  and it doesn't just involve Trump it involves a whole range of different actors around him at the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=763.52s)]
*  time right but look let's be blunt you know your dossier caused a firestorm obviously when it came [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  out it was funded by Hillary Clinton Democrats and other political opponents of of Trump leaked by [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=775.92s)]
*  Buzzfeed News just before he was sworn in as president for maximum potential damage and you [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=782.48s)]
*  know as you know because you pending contained a number of incendiary allegations not least of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=788.72s)]
*  which the one that the Russians may have held blackmail video of Trump engaged in you know [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=794.48s)]
*  very unsavory activity with prostitutes and so on which he's emphatically denied and for which no [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=800.64s)]
*  other evidence has ever emerged I mean do you accept um Christopher Steele that you're you're [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=805.6s)]
*  part of the problem here in the credibility that people attach to anything linking Trump [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=811.84s)]
*  and Putin because so much of that dossier to this day remains unproven and much of it has been widely [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=817.52s)]
*  discredited I don't believe it has been widely discredited I would agree that some of it's been [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  unproven I mean when you dig into the real detail of this if you look at the Mueller report for [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=831.12s)]
*  example we're going to go down into the detail a little bit here there was an exchange of emails [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=836.0s)]
*  between somebody called Rustaladze who was working in Moscow for Agalarov and Michael Cohen in I [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=841.6s)]
*  think October 2016 in which they talked about sex tapes frankly and about the need to suppress them [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=849.2s)]
*  so I think there's more to this piece if you actually look down into all the detail of the [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=857.44s)]
*  Senate report that was published which deals particularly with Manafort and Kalimnik and the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=861.9200000000001s)]
*  Mueller report as I say which contains details and you go back into things like the Sunny Isles [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=867.12s)]
*  deal and the Trump Tower deal and so on there's a lot of here that isn't really understood and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=873.12s)]
*  isn't played up and one of the issues with the whole collusion thing is that collusion is not a [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=878.72s)]
*  criminal offense and many of the investigations particularly the Mueller investigation [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=883.84s)]
*  were simply looking for criminal evidence for criminal prosecutions and not at the wider [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=888.5600000000001s)]
*  intelligence picture. All right Scott Horton I can see you shaking your head and I think I saw a [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=893.52s)]
*  bit of eye rolling so your response to that? Well there's a few things first of all the reason for [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=898.48s)]
*  Trump's policy is goes to what Mr. Scaramucci said it was Henry Kissinger's advice to recreate [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=905.92s)]
*  the Russian-Sino split if they're getting too close together we want to split the weaker off [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=914.56s)]
*  from the stronger just the way Kissinger did with Nixon in the early 70s making a treaty with China [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=919.44s)]
*  so Trump even had said that yeah Henry Kissinger told me I'm so smart because that's what I think [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=926.8800000000001s)]
*  that we ought to do so this is a recognition that Russia is part of Europe and part of you know [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=932.1600000000001s)]
*  greater Christendom and the West even if the eastern frontier of it and that we want to keep [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=939.12s)]
*  them moving towards us which had nominally been American policy since the end of the cold war [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=945.76s)]
*  even if very badly practiced that's what they said that they were trying to do and so that is [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=953.76s)]
*  Trump's motive here and if it hadn't have been for Mr. Steele and his cohorts that pushed the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=960.8s)]
*  Russiagate hoax back in 2016 then Trump would have been able to solve the problem in Ukraine then [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=965.84s)]
*  remember the FBI told CNN after the plan to depose Trump through the 25th amendment had fallen [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=973.3599999999999s)]
*  through if you could believe that they said well at least we can still rein him in on Russia policy [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=982.16s)]
*  by launching this special counsel investigation keeping the hoax going preventing him from [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  implementing his policy to this day he brags I'm the one who sent the javelin missiles as he did [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=994.4799999999999s)]
*  then because this is his body armor against the accusation that he's kowtowing to Putin is and [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1000.64s)]
*  his son even said oh yeah how can we bomb Assad then in Syria we if we're in the thrall of Vladimir [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1006.56s)]
*  Putin this kind of thing so it affected Donald Trump's foreign policy in his first term absolutely [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1014.0s)]
*  for the worst because as you said Pierce the conflict had started back in 2014 after the loss [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1021.04s)]
*  of Crimea and then the launch of the war in the Donbass and so there was a Minsk to peace deal [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1027.04s)]
*  but it had not been implemented and Trump's government I don't know if Trump knows this [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1034.72s)]
*  or not but his ambassador Adam Taylor told Ukraine not to implement the German proposal [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1039.68s)]
*  to to to try again to implement the Minsk to deal and put an end to the conflict in 2019 [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1045.28s)]
*  and so there's that part of it on the details of the steel dossier and all this stuff I mean you [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1052.48s)]
*  got to be kidding me I have 75 pages in my book I hope you're enjoying it Pierce I said I got it [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1058.16s)]
*  here provoked here it is there's a little plug for you how Washington started the new cold war [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1063.2800000000002s)]
*  with Russia and the catastrophe in Ukraine by Scott Holder a big meaty tome yes well I hope you're [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1068.72s)]
*  enjoying it I do have 75 pages on Russia gate uh in the end including a section on the steel dossier [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1075.6000000000001s)]
*  there and everything that he said about Manafort and page and all of these people in the Trump [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1081.68s)]
*  campaign were absolute lies in fact an FBI lawyer even was convicted for censoring the CIA memo [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1086.72s)]
*  to the FBI saying page works for us as not an agent but an asset a loyal American patriot [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1096.64s)]
*  who always debriefed the CIA anytime he met with an important Russian businessman or government [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1103.8400000000001s)]
*  official and this liar framed him essentially for treason and by the way his primary sources [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1108.96s)]
*  were a Russian named Danchenko who had been under investigation for being a Russian spy in the past [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1116.08s)]
*  the only reason they had dropped is because they mistakenly thought he left the country [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1122.24s)]
*  and then his partner an American named Dolan who actually was a registered agent of Russia [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1125.8400000000001s)]
*  they were the two primary sources who made up all those lies that you and I just recited Pierce [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1131.04s)]
*  that made it into steals dossier that they use and none of it was true not the hacking and the [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1136.16s)]
*  DNC not the alpha bank not any other steel dossier I'm amazed that this guy is willing to show his [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1142.0800000000002s)]
*  face in public right now when he was nothing but a washed up spy who hadn't had contacts in Russia [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1148.8000000000002s)]
*  for years by the time that he published that pile of lies it's incredible well I think I had a fair [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1153.92s)]
*  and yes I should go back to you Christopher still briefly um what's your response nothing [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1161.36s)]
*  nothing but a pile of lies I don't always pick the healthiest food options I'm sure you don't [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1166.8s)]

*  well I've never lied about any of this of course and it's been tested in court many times as you'll be [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1227.6799999999998s)]
*  aware I've been involved in several high court trials involved in this and have won them all [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1233.36s)]
*  so I don't think there's any basis upon which to think that we were deliberately lying on misleading [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1238.8s)]
*  anybody in fact of course the dossier wasn't meant to be made public at all so I think that [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1244.24s)]
*  that is going down the wrong path in terms of our source base in Russia obviously we don't talk about [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1249.36s)]
*  that but I've made a successful business over the last 15 years over over running sources in Russia [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1254.96s)]
*  and China and other places producing intelligence to meet high standards of corporate requirements [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1261.52s)]

*  hear Joe Walsh it seems to me that Trump's issued a statement saying had a very good call with [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1316.48s)]
*  President Zelensky today just completed a very good telephone call lasting more than an hour [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1323.28s)]
*  apparently much of a discussion was based on the call yesterday with President Putin in order to [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1327.6000000000001s)]
*  align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs we are very much on track and [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1332.48s)]
*  said he'd instructed Marco Rubio, Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Mike Walsh to [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1338.48s)]
*  give an accurate description of the points discussed and that statement will come out shortly I mean [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1343.8400000000001s)]
*  this seems like real progress to me you know you can hate Trump as much as you like you can think [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1348.16s)]
*  he's in bed with Putin whatever whatever but the fact he's spoken to both the leaders at length [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1352.4s)]
*  in the last 24 hours and he's giving very positive noises about the way this is going isn't that where [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1358.0800000000002s)]
*  we all want to get to? Here's good to be with you look I generally don't pay attention to or [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1365.0400000000002s)]
*  believe anything Trump says and that's principally where you and I differ because I do believe he [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1373.2800000000002s)]
*  generally lies every time he opens his mouth but Pierce I've just got to go and I loved your open [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1380.56s)]
*  and I respect your open but we talk about the Russia gate hoax I don't know what we're referring [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1386.8s)]
*  to everybody knows all of our intelligence people know Trump's all of Trump's people knew at the [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1394.6399999999999s)]
*  time that Russia in an unprecedented way tried to impact the 2016 election that wasn't the [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1402.3999999999999s)]
*  allegation yeah but hang on that wasn't that no I didn't call it a hoax by the way but but secondly [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1410.0s)]
*  that wasn't the central charge the central charge was that the Kremlin had directly [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1415.84s)]
*  colluded with Donald Trump to get him to win the election and there was no evidence for that [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1422.24s)]
*  it turned out to be bullshit. Pierce I'm getting to that and I'll quickly get to that but the central [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1427.36s)]
*  thesis that Putin and Russia interfered in our election to help get Trump elected that was [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1433.2s)]
*  accepted by all of our intelligence people Trump's intelligent people and Obama's that's when Trump [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1439.9199999999998s)]
*  stood up in 2018 in Helsinki and Trump said I don't believe my own people I stand with Putin [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1448.32s)]
*  as far as collusion Pierce the Mueller report is littered with collusion as as not the conclusion [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1455.04s)]
*  no but what it went through all the stuff that was there and ultimately it did not it did not [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1464.88s)]
*  conclude that Trump had colluded with Russia to fix the election and people could keep talking [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1472.72s)]
*  about it but the bottom line is that was the whole purpose of the investigation it proved Mueller [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1478.48s)]
*  Mueller and the Mueller report showed improved collusion Mueller himself said it didn't rise to [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1484.56s)]
*  the level of a crime right to a conspiracy I accept that but there was don't don't say the [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1491.68s)]
*  Mueller report denied collusion it said the collusion we found we couldn't prove it rose [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1498.64s)]
*  to the level of a conspiracy right but there was collusion right okay that's nonsense that is not [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1505.2s)]
*  true at all anyone can read the Mueller report for themselves and see where they come up with [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1512.24s)]
*  absolutely nothing they don't even have a chain of custody of the DNC leak to WikiLeaks or anything [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1517.04s)]
*  at all and then the Durham report is 10 times worse the Durham report is the investigation [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1522.0s)]
*  into the investigation and the start of it all where John Durham the special agent absolutely or [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1529.68s)]
*  pardon me special prosecutor absolutely debunks every shred of this hoax to the bones [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1536.72s)]

*  here obviously you're trying to sabotage what President Trump is doing when it comes to Russia [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1567.04s)]
*  and Ukraine but to sit here what is it nearly a decade after you tried to smear President Trump [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1571.36s)]

*  registered foreign agents here in the United States the American people would really appreciate it [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1603.52s)]
*  if you would stop injecting your efforts to curtail and totally tank the America First movement [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1608.64s)]

*  the answer to that but I can tell you this if the shares keep dropping he's going to get faced with [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1930.3999999999999s)]
*  a margin call because he put up those shares as collateral to borrow debt to purchase X peers [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=1935.52s)]

*  there could be 20 million humans up on Mars I think that's probably a bit of a stretch but [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2010.8s)]

*  but he has been very deliberately and very provocatively poking his way into UK politics [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2029.76s)]
*  demanding that the prime minister be put in prison he directly involved himself in the [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2037.52s)]
*  German election aligning himself with what many believe there to be the far right etc etc and he [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2042.3999999999999s)]
*  of course he remains an unelected official who seems to have open access to the White House [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2048.8s)]
*  a lot of people don't like this Trump is a lot more popular than Elon Musk is right now. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2053.1200000000003s)]
*  Well Pierce look and again I say this as someone who's in the public eye Elon's got to grow up he [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2058.48s)]
*  he made this decision as Anthony said to get into politics that's not all though Pierce [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2065.6800000000003s)]
*  he chose a side and he's free to do that and he chose he chose to join Trump and MAGA [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2073.52s)]
*  and he chose to attack the left and he chose to get involved as you said in European elections [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2080.8s)]
*  he's free to make those decisions but because he chose to be partisan absolutely then he's going to [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2089.04s)]
*  take the protests the boycotts he's going to take the hate because he's jumped into the arena [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2097.84s)]
*  and he's chosen a side and now he's got to live with that having said that Pierce political violence [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2106.08s)]
*  is always wrong yeah and unacceptable. Right so Natalie I mean it seems to me look there's no doubt [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2113.76s)]
*  that I kind of get the big picture here that Trump and Musk are trying to do I do and it may well [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2119.76s)]
*  turn out to work but there's no doubt in the short term in the first eight weeks Trump's popularity [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2125.28s)]
*  has dramatically reduced as has Elon Musk even more dramatically you know people want quick results [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2131.0400000000004s)]
*  they're not getting them they're seeing the stock market tanking they're seeing you know prices [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2139.1200000000003s)]
*  for most products still very high etc etc how careful do they have to be here because they [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2144.4s)]
*  got a big win Trump and and the Republicans at the election how careful have they got to be right now [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2151.2799999999997s)]
*  well I don't necessarily know if President Trump and Elon Musk are are hemorrhaging support I think [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2159.52s)]
*  there's been some recent poll numbers coming out showing that it's really the Democratic party [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2163.6s)]
*  who's having a real identity crisis well they're far worse I agree they're far worse but there's no [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2167.68s)]
*  doubt all the polling I've seen shows Trump's polling and Musk's in particular are significantly [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2171.7599999999998s)]
*  lower than from election day so I think the American people the Democrats are completely [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2177.76s)]
*  in the town I mean the Democrats are shot to pieces I think we can all agree with that [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2183.1200000000003s)]
*  worst polling in recorded history and thoroughly deserved for the shambolic way they behaved in the [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2187.44s)]
*  last year but let's but let's focus just on Trump and Musk you know they're all in on what they're [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2193.44s)]
*  doing but at the moment the public I would describe it as they're wary they're like we're nervous about [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2198.7200000000003s)]
*  this well I think the way that the media has depicted what they're doing is contributing to [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2204.08s)]
*  that I think overwhelmingly the American people support the idea of cutting waste fraud and abuse [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2209.84s)]
*  be my guest if you want to find me a Democrat or an American citizen who wants to send millions and [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2215.2s)]
*  at the end of the day billions of taxpayer dollars not just to fund the weird transgender [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2220.16s)]
*  musicals in foreign countries but you know really weird perverse bio weapon research in countries [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2224.48s)]
*  like China I don't think that that's something that the American people support I do think there [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2229.36s)]
*  is overwhelmingly a lot of support for the Doge efforts I think there's sort of this [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2233.28s)]
*  maniacal focus on these protests against Elon Musk I don't necessarily share your victim blaming idea [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2237.6800000000003s)]
*  that just because someone weighs into the political space that therefore their companies should be [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2243.76s)]
*  attacked there should be brutal demonstrations cars set on fire I think people can oppose Tesla [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2248.5600000000004s)]
*  by choosing not to buy those cars but what you're seeing is extremely well funded and coordinated [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2253.92s)]
*  demonstrations targeting really him from the vantage point where I think Democrats for the [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2258.32s)]
*  last four years they used lawfare they used over regulation frankly they used censorship [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2262.64s)]
*  because they had all the levers of the government to do so and now that they don't they're desperate [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2268.24s)]
*  they're flailing like the polling we were just talking about so they're acting out like petulant [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2272.3199999999997s)]
*  children and trying to burn down cars and attack not just Elon Musk but attack his supporters but [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2276.56s)]
*  I just reject your premise that Doge is something that is not popular with the American people [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2282.48s)]
*  You can have nuanced debates about the Medicaid Medicare yeah yeah listen don't don't I think [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2287.2799999999997s)]
*  you slightly mischaracterize what I said I don't think Doge is particularly unpopular I think [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2291.68s)]
*  what's happened and I'll come to Scott for this the it's just the personal approval ratings for [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2297.6s)]
*  Trump and Musk in particular have fallen significantly and are continuing to fall. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2302.3199999999997s)]
*  What do you make of this because it's a very unusual way they're going about a presidency [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2308.64s)]
*  like I said you know my gut feeling is they're on to the right thing but it may take [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2312.8799999999997s)]
*  a significant amount of time to realize itself and they may not get enough time. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2317.12s)]
*  Well I don't know about his poll numbers and what's really behind all that I hope it's because a huge [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2324.16s)]
*  part of the Magor right is trying to hold him to his word about America first not Israel instead [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2330.0s)]
*  and I guess that goes to our next topic or one of our topics today is the horrible war there and [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2336.48s)]
*  and Donald Trump acting just like Joe Biden just like Kamala Harris would in his position [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2343.04s)]
*  given Netanyahu a blank check to cancel the peace deal and bomb whoever he feels like [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2348.0s)]
*  including a hell of a lot of children if you look at x.com in the feed there at the horrific pictures [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2352.88s)]
*  coming out of Palestine there and that's it's the most obvious contradiction you can't be America [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2359.36s)]
*  first and Israel instead it's got to be one or the other and I know the American right is almost [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2368.32s)]
*  solidly on the side of Israel in almost all cases but everybody's got their limit and you know the [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2375.92s)]
*  American right used to really believe in George W Bush in the Iraq war until they decided they [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2382.56s)]
*  didn't anymore and I think there's a big crack up coming on the right because what we're supporting [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2387.04s)]
*  there is just absolutely horrific I mean they're talking about oh well maybe we'll just transfer [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2393.76s)]
*  the population to Syria so they can go live under the rule of al-qaeda that America and Turkey just [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2397.52s)]
*  helped install and power there and Israel helped install and power there I mean this is completely [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2402.48s)]
*  insane what they're talking about and and what they seem to have in mind I don't know if they [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2407.52s)]
*  have an idea of how they're how they mean to accomplish it but I was having a good time [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2412.4s)]
*  watching Elon Musk fire government employees and I'm angry at the judges every time that they turn [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2417.6s)]
*  back these firings and I don't extend that to the immigration thing that's different but [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2423.28s)]
*  and I mean specifically those guys who are just deportee tell Salvador whether they'd ever been [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2428.0s)]
*  there before in their lives but a lot of these judge rulings drive me crazy I love seeing the [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2433.28s)]
*  death of USAID or at least you know it's massive diminishment and a lot of the rest of this stuff [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2439.36s)]
*  yeah and I would also say Joe I will come to you Joe I would say just to Elon Musk's to his credit [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2444.5600000000004s)]
*  you know we're seeing the best of him as well this week with the return of the NASA astronauts [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2451.12s)]
*  from the international you know space station situation they got themselves into you know that [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2456.72s)]
*  is Elon Musk at his absolute best you know doing what he does best yeah Joe no Pierce to what Scott [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2462.4s)]
*  just said these judges drive me crazy well I'm sorry that's our constitutional system that's [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2470.56s)]
*  driving you crazy and this is part of Elon's and Trump's problem is that the vast majority of what [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2478.48s)]
*  they're doing is unconstitutional a judge just came out yesterday and said everything they've [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2485.92s)]
*  been doing with USAID is not constitutional that matters that doesn't mean Trump and Musk don't [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2492.0s)]
*  have recourse they can appeal that judge's rulings but you don't do what Musk and Trump do and just [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2499.52s)]
*  scream that oh these judges must be impeached excuse me that's part of the system this constitutional [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2506.96s)]
*  part well look I agree with that and really they should be going to congress for as much of this [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2515.12s)]
*  as they possibly can on the other hand you notice that the president can do anything he wants [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2520.0s)]
*  Obama can announce the launch of a war against Libya while he's on vacation in Brazil he announced [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2524.56s)]
*  the the war in Yemen in 2015 by having a state department spokeswoman just put out a press [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2530.08s)]
*  release so the the American president is the emperor of the world who can do just about anything [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2536.72s)]
*  except fire government employees and stop executive branch employees from abusing their power and [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2542.72s)]
*  wasting our money the moment he tries to do that the whole government acts like you know antibodies [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2548.24s)]
*  fighting a germ against their own president just the same as last time when they framed him for [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2554.48s)]
*  treason with Russia to keep him from exercising power of his own government you know what they [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2558.3199999999997s)]
*  said they said Trump is like the captain of a ship he's holding the wheel but it's not attached [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2562.56s)]
*  to anything because his whole government is in rebellion against him even though he's the one [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2567.68s)]
*  who stood for election and won the right to sit in that chair behind that desk not them okay let me [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2572.32s)]
*  Anthony I think you've got a slight heart out today but I just wanted to talk to you about what's [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2578.64s)]
*  happening with Israel the IDF as we've been talking says it's launched a new limited ground invasion [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2583.12s)]
*  in Gaza the Israeli government says it's to retake part of a key corridor into Gaza obviously this [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2589.68s)]
*  follows extensive airstrikes in the last two days you know we have to go on the Palestinian the [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2595.92s)]
*  health authority which is Hamas run on the death toll but it's believed up to a thousand people [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2603.2799999999997s)]
*  may have been killed in the last two days in this new offensive which has obviously shattered the [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2611.12s)]
*  ceasefire now I get the argument from the Israeli side that if Hamas is suspending the process of [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2616.4s)]
*  releasing the hostages they're still nearly 60 who are being held they believe you know it was [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2623.84s)]
*  still alive but if it is doing that then obviously at some point Israel is going to have to do [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2628.96s)]
*  something to try and force them to release them is it though the right course of action to just go out [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2633.76s)]
*  and create a thousand more deaths whatever it may be including god knows how many children [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2640.4s)]
*  because half the population is under 18 I just think the optics of this for Israel are terrible [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2646.8s)]
*  and I also think that their central point which is they the whole war is about eliminating Hamas [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2652.6400000000003s)]
*  at the moment there's no sign they've done that at all in fact by releasing hundreds and hundreds [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2659.2000000000003s)]
*  of Palestinian prisoners as part of this hostage deal they're running back presumably many of them [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2664.4s)]
*  aligned ideologically with Hamas and we've seen with the release of the hostages so much support [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2670.08s)]
*  for Hamas on the ground in Gaza still so they don't seem to be achieving the central aim of [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2676.16s)]
*  the war what they're doing is just killing more and more people which I have always felt at some [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2681.7599999999998s)]
*  stage will just start to fuel rather than kill off the ideology well listen this is going to be a [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2687.44s)]
*  controversial statement I'm sure I'm going to inflame everybody that's on the panel with me but [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2697.36s)]
*  I always thought that they needed to create a buffer zone there and they should have done [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2702.2400000000002s)]
*  that with some level of cooperation in the Arab world I think that the president actually hurt [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2707.2000000000003s)]
*  the situation by saying he was going to I guess move 1.8 million people out of the region obviously [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2712.7200000000003s)]
*  his allies in the gulf rejected that out of hand and he had a reverse course last week by saying of [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2719.76s)]
*  course he's not going to do that but to me I think what they're doing is actually hardening [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2725.28s)]
*  opposition against Israel and I'm obviously a strong proponent for Israel and I'm a supporter [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2730.7200000000003s)]
*  of Israel but I don't think we can support indiscriminate death I think it's just something that [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2737.44s)]
*  you know imagine if Winston Churchill guys or any of our allies during the war you know we killed [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2743.84s)]
*  400 000 german civilians through the bombings and the bombing of dresden [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2749.68s)]
*  piers I know you know a lot about it Curtis LeMay is obviously a war criminal based on what he did in [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2756.72s)]
*  dresden but it wasn't well reported just imagine if these people had this type of reporting or your [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2762.0s)]
*  show going on during the second world war so to me the yeah but that was one of the reasons why [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2767.9199999999996s)]
*  we created things like the Geneva convention I mean there was a widespread acceptance that there [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2772.72s)]
*  were horrific crimes committed during the war which should not be allowed to happen again I [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2777.04s)]
*  thought dresden was appalling you know and should not be allowed to have happened but that was why [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2782.32s)]
*  they set up the Geneva convention and other instruments to avoid this kind of make this [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2786.32s)]
*  point then so so why didn't we have an international coalition of people there's a lot of willing [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2792.0s)]
*  people to create a strategic buffer zone in the Gaza strip between Israel and the Gaza and then [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2798.0s)]
*  you know the the issue related to the political support around Hamas we could address that by [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2807.76s)]
*  taking the security concern away from Israel and so what Israel's saying right now is that we're [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2815.28s)]
*  threatened by Hamas Hamas has lots of political support we're going to continue to bomb them [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2821.68s)]
*  until morale improves proves and I can never worked fierce I can answer that first of all [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2826.88s)]
*  I think I think it's important and everyone on this panel and in this audience has heard [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2834.2400000000002s)]
*  Israeli officials invoke dresden and Tokyo and Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the precedent [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2837.84s)]
*  for why they can bond this Indian reservation the way America took it out on Hitler and Tojo [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2843.04s)]
*  which is completely insane and as noted completely illegal because that's why they wrote the Geneva [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2848.08s)]
*  conventions in the first place secondly mr. Scaramucci the thing is there is a buffer zone [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2854.0s)]
*  around Gaza there has been for a very long time that's why we call October 7th October 7th not [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2859.6s)]
*  the second week of October or you know the autumn of 2023 it lasted one day because what happened [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2866.24s)]
*  essentially was people broke out of their pen because the Israeli security forces were completely [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2874.32s)]
*  negligent in their so-called duty to keep those people locked in there they literally had automatic [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2880.64s)]
*  machine guns like idiocracy on remote control and they got caught with their pants down on a [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2886.48s)]
*  Saturday morning but the whole thing was over by midnight okay so there is a buffer zone in other [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2892.0s)]
*  words they don't have to do this at all they never did and when it comes to the entire history of [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2897.92s)]
*  Israel Palestine since the creation of the state their special operations forces and spies have [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2904.0s)]
*  shown that they can reach out and touch someone one at a time they do it all the time when that's [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2909.04s)]
*  what they want to do instead what they've done here is level the place invoking Dresden level [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2914.96s)]
*  the place to make it uninhabitable because they want to steal it they want to drive the Palestinians [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2922.0s)]
*  out of there if they can't push them into Egypt now they're promoting pushing them into Syria the [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2927.44s)]
*  wall street journal even let a couple of Israeli officials run an article in our paper saying you [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2932.72s)]
*  take them you love the Palestinians so much and this is their plan and what's worse is they don't [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2937.92s)]
*  even really care that much about the Gaza Strip it's the West Bank that they want but they're [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2943.6s)]
*  going to go ahead and try to take care of this while they can and that's why they broke the cease [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2948.16s)]
*  fire they don't want to cease fire okay I want to give Anthony the chance to respond before we [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2952.56s)]
*  don't have time for me to respond to that but that that that does deserve a response yeah go [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2957.84s)]
*  ahead sure no actually but before you go just respond to that [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2963.36s)]
*  listen you could go back to 9-eleven the way the Americans responded was very aggressive in 9-eleven [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2970.5600000000004s)]
*  and it was an overreach to go into Iraq so we're in agreement that there's an overreach going on [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2977.1200000000003s)]
*  right now but if you're telling me you're in a seat of political leadership and there's an attack [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2982.96s)]
*  like that and I've seen the 47-minute IDF film and I just ask you to put yourself in the shoes [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2987.44s)]
*  of an Israeli political leader you're in a very very tough spot in terms of how you're going to [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=2994.4s)]
*  protect your country you're right about the dereliction of duty at the border on that Sunday [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3001.12s)]
*  morning but I'm just telling you they were in a tough spot what I'm saying is they had to respond [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3006.64s)]
*  I mean I would add this I would add this point which is I would add this point Scott Scott I [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3013.12s)]
*  would say this I would say this the scale of what Hamas did that day 3,000 of them in three ways [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3018.64s)]
*  coming over the border committing mass horrific acts of terrorism against anyone that could get [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3024.64s)]
*  their hands on 1,200 were murdered at least 250 odd were kidnapped including babies, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3031.3599999999997s)]
*  Holocaust survivors and so on nearly 7,000 more were wounded the the idea that Hamas launched [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3038.3199999999997s)]
*  such an enormous attack on Israel without knowing for an absolute certainty as they did so the scale [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3045.4399999999996s)]
*  of Israel's response was going to be equally enormous if not a lot more so I think is for [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3052.56s)]
*  the birds and I listen you can go back in any way I agree with you by the way about the the argument [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3058.7999999999997s)]
*  they broke out of the pen I get all this I get I get the argument that you know the Palestinians [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3065.6s)]
*  have been oppressed for a long period of time that they should have equal rights I agree with [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3070.4s)]
*  all this there should be a two-state solution everything but anyone that tries to in any way [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3074.96s)]
*  mitigate or downplay the scale of what Hamas did and that is why it runs so deep I think on [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3080.48s)]
*  the Israeli side I think that is part of the problem here I didn't say anything to diminish [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3086.72s)]
*  no no I'm not saying you did I'm just saying this one no we're gonna let the mooch go [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3094.08s)]
*  Anthony I really appreciate you joining us I know you appreciate I've stolen six more minutes than [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3100.4s)]
*  I was supposed to from you Anthony every minute is gold you know that I just had a radio I know you [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3106.0s)]
*  do I really appreciate it thank you for thank you for having me on guys really appreciate joining [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3111.44s)]
*  you know and I'm loving your uh your show thank you very much uh great to see uh let's just pick [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3115.92s)]
*  up the rest of the panel Natalie it seems to me that Israel is not achieving his aim it can level [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3120.48s)]
*  as much of Gaza as it wants but ultimately it is not according to all independent studies of what's [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3127.28s)]
*  happening there it is not eliminating Hamas or its ideology if I have anything you might be fueling [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3134.16s)]
*  even more hate towards Israel no exactly I mean it looks like it's shaping up to be another forever [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3140.96s)]
*  war and I really take the viewpoint that I care about this from the America first perspective I [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3148.16s)]
*  don't think the United States should be continuing to fan the flames of war anywhere let alone when [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3153.7599999999998s)]
*  you look at the atrocities that have been committed on both sides obviously it's a very heated issue [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3158.24s)]
*  but to that point I think when you look at the college campus demonstrations that we had or even [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3162.96s)]
*  the advocacy of people like Mahmoud Khalil right that's a case that's really in every the forefront [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3167.8399999999997s)]
*  of everyone's mind right now you know he hates Israel and by extension the United States of [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3172.08s)]
*  America because of a conflict that's going on very very very far away from us that we're entangled [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3177.44s)]
*  in because of I would argue along with you know political influence and stuff but also it has to [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3182.56s)]
*  do with energy dominance and oil that's also what's going on in Russia and Ukraine and when I see [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3186.88s)]
*  conflicts like this my first and foremost priority obviously is putting America first but it's also [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3190.96s)]
*  the importance I think of American energy independence and frankly American energy [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3195.44s)]
*  dominance so we're not so embedded with whatever country it may be Ukraine or in this case it's [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3199.92s)]
*  Israel and having to support countries for reasons that are not explicitly or demonstrably [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3204.96s)]
*  beneficial to Americans that lead us to essentially importing a bunch of people if not homegrown [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3209.76s)]
*  Americans who sort of have an affinity or an allegiance to Hamas because they really dislike [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3215.76s)]
*  what Israel's doing yeah you know it's very interesting Joe I think the the way the Republicans [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3220.32s)]
*  a lot of Republicans view Ukraine is a very different situation to Israel and Hamas you know [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3226.56s)]
*  I had a big argument with Tucker Carlson about this because I said well what's I don't understand [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3232.64s)]
*  if the reason for getting out of Ukraine and not helping Ukraine is America first you don't want [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3237.36s)]
*  to get involved in foreign wars many many thousands of miles away from America's border it's not in [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3242.64s)]
*  American national interest okay it's a perfectly reasonable argument you can have particularly as [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3248.72s)]
*  America's been involved in so many wars that you cannot point to much victory in the last 70 80 years [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3253.36s)]
*  but what is the distinction then ideologically between then getting involved in helping Israel [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3260.9599999999996s)]
*  in a war over in the Middle East and they sort of they go through a real set of hoops trying to [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3267.52s)]
*  explain to me why one is okay and the other one isn't when it seems to me you're either against [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3273.52s)]
*  both of it or you probably seem to be support both. Pierce that's a great point and look I say this [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3279.04s)]
*  as someone who is most everybody on this panel would think I'm idiotically pro-Israel I am but [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3286.56s)]
*  the Israel caucus Israel has great influence on my former party the Republican Party Israel also [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3294.96s)]
*  Pierce though is a great great long ally of ours you beautifully Pierce described what October 7th [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3303.84s)]
*  was and again I know we have to find a solution but October 7th changed everything for Israel [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3312.32s)]
*  the days of them living next door to a terrorist group like Hamas not acknowledging Israel's right [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3322.32s)]
*  to exist those days are done so yeah there needs to be some sort of big broad solution here and the [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3331.04s)]
*  moderate Arab world needs to get involved damn quickly but we're never going back to the world [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3338.56s)]
*  where Hamas is ruling Gaza those days are done no I mean I think the concern is that the ideology [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3345.04s)]
*  behind Hamas that you know the American intelligence seems to suggest for every [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3352.24s)]
*  Hamas terrorist who's been killed they've already replaced them with somebody that shares that [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3356.72s)]
*  ideology if that is true and you add all the hundreds of prisoners being released many of [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3360.88s)]
*  whom will I'm sure be sympathetic if not active supporters of Hamas you know it's hard to see how [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3366.16s)]
*  the mission statement of this war is going to be achieved and we're going to end it there but Scott [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3372.0s)]
*  I want to give you a chance to plug your book this meaty tome as I said earlier and for those who are [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3376.72s)]
*  not familiar with you or your work just very quickly summarize the book and why they should buy it [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3382.56s)]
*  well thank you very much for that Pierce and for having me on again the book is again called [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SSUWmn7iGE&t=3388.56s)]
