Video Description: As Iran claims to have launched an attack on an American air base in Qatar in retaliation to Donald Trump striking their nuclear bases, it’s difficult to predict what may happen next, as the conflicts in the Middle East intensifies day by day.
There are many targets left, the US President says - and if Iran doesn’t play ball, he will attack them too. But the administration took great care yesterday to make it clear that the US does not want a long war and that regime change is not the aim - a view somewhat at odds with statements Trump himself has been sharing on his social media.
Piers Morgan unpacks the latest with his panel; ‘The Young Turks’ host Ana Kasparian, former IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus, asst. Secretary of State under George W. Bush, Mark Kimmitt and author, filmmaker and podcaster Dinesh D’Souza.
He also speaks to former US national security adviser John Bolton, former diplomatic adviser to Iran nuclear negotiating team Kaveh Afrasiabi, former IDF general and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Minister of Diaspora Affairs in Israel Amichai Chikli .

# ‘Time To FINISH The Job’ | Trump Strikes Nuclear Sites | Iran Attacks US Bases
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM)
*  I would be very, very surprised if the Iranians don't attack either with their missiles, their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=0.0s)]
*  militias, or through direct terrorist activities. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=6.4s)]
*  You guys got what you wanted. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  You guys got your war. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=10.38s)]
*  Are you expecting American troops to fight this war and die on your behalf? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  Or are you going to bring the Israelis back, tell them to put their fatigues on, and get [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=16.12s)]
*  ready? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=20.04s)]
*  I can feel how sad you are. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=21.04s)]
*  I can feel how difficult it is for you to see Israel teaching the Iranian regime a lesson [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=22.68s)]
*  that you're sad about the Iranian regime getting targeted all because you hate the Jews and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=29.12s)]
*  you hate Israel. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=35.36s)]
*  You genocidal prick. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=36.36s)]
*  We should want regime change. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=38.24s)]
*  How much we do is a different story. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=39.8s)]
*  There are a lot of ways to achieve regime change. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=41.72s)]
*  None of them involve boots on the ground. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=44.08s)]
*  And you think that it can come and dictate to a country 80 times? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=46.08s)]
*  The answer of why your regime is enriching to military grade, why it means 80. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=49.72s)]
*  Let me ask you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=54.88s)]
*  Does Israel have nuclear weapons? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=55.88s)]
*  History books will answer what you're saying but you're not even acknowledging me as a person. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=57.720000000000006s)]
*  President Trump kept the whole world guessing over whether the US would strike Iran. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=66.44s)]
*  And when it comes to what happens next, he still is. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=69.76s)]
*  This cannot continue. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=73.4s)]
*  There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran, far greater than we have [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=74.76s)]
*  witnessed over the last eight days. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=80.6s)]
*  Remember, there are many targets left. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=83.2s)]
*  Tonight's was the most difficult of them all by far and perhaps the most lethal. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  But if peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=93.48s)]
*  speed and skill. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=99.04s)]
*  Well, there are many targets left, the president says, and if Iran doesn't play ball, the United [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  States will attack them too. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  But the administration took great care yesterday to make clear that the US does not want a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  long war and that regime change is not the aim. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=109.76s)]
*  Is the United States now at war with Iran? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=113.0s)]
*  No, Kristen, we're not at war with Iran. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=118.32s)]
*  We're at war with Iran's nuclear program. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=120.64s)]
*  We don't want a regime change. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=122.84s)]
*  We do not want to protract this or build this out any more than it's already been built out. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=124.88s)]
*  We want to end their nuclear program and then we want to talk to the Iranians about a long-term [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=129.6s)]
*  settlement here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=134.52s)]
*  This mission was not and has not been about regime change. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=136.36s)]
*  The president authorized a precision operation to neutralize the threats to our national [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=140.72s)]
*  interests posed by the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=146.72s)]
*  The president, though, is not quite so clear. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=150.72s)]
*  He posted last night, it's not politically correct to use the term regime change, but [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=153.36s)]
*  if the current Iranian regime is unable to make Iran great again, why shouldn't there [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=157.44s)]
*  be a regime change? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=161.84s)]
*  But if the past 10 days show us anything, is that there are any claim to understand [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=163.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's strategy based on these break rums is purely speculative. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  Only Trump knows his next move and he likes it that way. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  The problem for those who are still soul-searching of whether to back him or striking Iran is [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=174.28s)]
*  that so is the damage the attacks have done. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  We don't yet know if Iran's nuclear facilities have been totally obliterated, as President [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=181.56s)]
*  Trump said. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  We don't yet know if Iran's massive stockpile of enriched uranium was wiped out in the US [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  attack. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  My view of the whole crisis is that too many people are basing their view of it on whether [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  they are instinctively anti-Trump, anti-Israel, anti-war. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=196.04s)]
*  Two things can be true at the same time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=199.56s)]
*  You can support a precision strike on Iran's nuclear facilities without supporting another [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=201.72s)]
*  long conflict in the Middle East. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  You can oppose Western involvement without supporting the Ayatollah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=207.56s)]
*  And you can support Israel's position against a nuclear Iran while unequivocally condemning [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=211.44s)]
*  the suffering it's now inflicting on the people of Gaza. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=215.92s)]
*  Breaking news, the world is complicated and after the events of the past few days, it's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=219.32s)]
*  not about to get any simpler. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=224.28s)]
*  I'd like to welcome my panel now, Anna Kasparin, executive producer and host of The Young Turks, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=225.52s)]
*  Jonathan Conricus, retired Lieutenant Colonel and IDF spokesman Dinesh D'Souza, host of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=230.32s)]
*  the Dinesh D'Souza podcast and retired Brigadier General Mark Kimmett, Assistant Secretary of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=235.24s)]
*  State under George W. Bush. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, General Kimmett, let me start with you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=241.36s)]
*  From a purely military perspective, how successful do you think first the Israeli strike on Iran [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=243.36s)]
*  has been because it's ongoing? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=252.44s)]
*  And secondly, the intervention by President Trump with American strikes. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=254.4s)]
*  I know that there are words being thrown around yesterday like obliterated, so on and so forth. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=259.68s)]
*  But I believe when General Keynes says partially destroyed at Fordow, I think that's really [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=266.4s)]
*  the best way to describe it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=271.68s)]
*  We don't have the bomb damage assessment yet. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=274.36s)]
*  I think we need to wait for a technical assessment rather than a rhetorical assessment. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=276.76000000000005s)]
*  So let's give it time. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=282.76000000000005s)]
*  But I believe that General Keynes is right when he says partially destroyed. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  There may be some reattacks when the bomb damage assessment comes back and says, this [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=288.68s)]
*  is how much we've taken out. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=294.12s)]
*  And to take it out to your standards, to the military standards, we need to reattack this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  method. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=301.24s)]
*  So I think the next time we're going to see planes in the air is either for a reattack [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  or to respond to an Iranian attack on American forces, embassies or bases in the region. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=306.68s)]
*  How likely is it, do you think, that Iran will respond by directly attacking American [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=313.04s)]
*  servicemen and women? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=319.32s)]
*  We've seen this before. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=321.92s)]
*  When the Qasem Soleimani was targeted, they sent 12 ballistic missiles into al-Assad base. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=322.92s)]
*  There were a significant number of casualties. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=328.68s)]
*  Thank God there were no deaths. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  But it's a prideful nation. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=334.0s)]
*  It's part of the axis of resistance. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  It needs to demonstrate that it will resist. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=338.04s)]
*  So certainly our force protection elements are in place. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=341.72s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  I would be very, very surprised if the Iranians don't attack either with their missiles, their [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=348.12s)]
*  militias or through direct terrorist activities. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=352.68s)]
*  Ana Gasparin, your view of the combined attacks, Israel and the United States? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=356.28s)]
*  Well, I think Israel has been pushing for regime change in Iran. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=366.52s)]
*  The claims that Iran was close to developing a nuclear weapon was false. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  Not only were they over a year away, according to Netanyahu himself, in being able to develop [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=375.84s)]
*  a nuclear weapon, they didn't even have a mechanism in order to deliver said nuclear weapon. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=382.2s)]
*  This has been all about engaging in a regime change war. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  That's what this is. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=392.12s)]
*  Anyone who's pretending like this is about nuclear weapons is lying to you. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=393.12s)]
*  Again, the United States is forced to fight another war on behalf of Israel. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  And I just want to ask Konricas a question real quick, because I'm seeing a lot of videos [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=401.28s)]
*  of Israelis leaving Israel to go home to the United States or to Greece or to other European [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=405.64s)]
*  countries. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=411.68s)]
*  You guys got what you wanted. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=412.68s)]
*  You guys got your war. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=414.2s)]
*  Are you expecting American troops to fight this war and die on your behalf? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=415.64s)]
*  Or are you going to bring the Israelis back, tell them to put their fatigues on and get [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=420.04s)]
*  ready for a ground invasion? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=423.8s)]
*  Because if they want regime change, they're going to need a ground invasion and Americans [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=425.64s)]
*  shouldn't be forced to do it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=429.32s)]
*  I will let Jonathan Konricas respond. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=430.8s)]
*  Although I would say, in relation to your super confidence that Iran was not planning [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=432.64s)]
*  to weaponize its enriched uranium, what else could they possibly have been planning? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=439.76s)]
*  Even they took the enrichment process according to the Independent Atomic Energy Authority, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=444.24s)]
*  they took their enrichment of uranium from the three and a half percent required for [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=450.03999999999996s)]
*  civilian usage to 60 percent in the last few years. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=453.92s)]
*  There is no other reason you would do that if you weren't at the very least wanting [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=458.36s)]
*  people to believe that you were going to be weaponizing your uranium. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=462.28s)]
*  Otherwise, why do it? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=467.24s)]
*  Well, I mean, they were not enriching uranium under the Iran nuclear deal, the JCPOA, which [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=469.56s)]
*  unfortunately Trump took the pressure from Netanyahu to pull out of in 2018, which essentially [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=477.88s)]
*  cleared the way for Iran to enrich uranium. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=484.6s)]
*  Now, yes, they enriched up to 60 percent. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  You need 90 percent in order to have the material necessary to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=489.44s)]
*  However, I think what Iran was doing, considering the fact that they're in a region of thugs [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=493.96s)]
*  in Israel who clearly have been announcing that they want regime change in Iran, they [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  wanted a deterrent. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=503.96s)]
*  I think that's what they were doing. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=504.96s)]
*  As this war in Gaza, this genocide in Gaza continues, I think they wanted some form of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=506.32s)]
*  a deterrent, much like Israel has with their over 90 nuclear weapons that they don't acknowledge, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=511.88s)]
*  of course. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=517.72s)]
*  They're not part of the nonproliferation treaty, even though Iran was. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=518.72s)]
*  There's really interesting comparisons there. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=522.56s)]
*  OK, General Kim, I know you have to leave us. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=524.6s)]
*  Jonathan Kim, because I will come to you in one moment, but I just want to ask the general [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  to respond to that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=530.84s)]
*  Is there a naivety by many on the left, you think, about Iran's intentions with this enriched [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=532.48s)]
*  uranium? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=538.64s)]
*  Because I oppose the Iraq war as a newspaper editor in the UK, very vociferously. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=539.64s)]
*  It cost me my job in the end, actually. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  But I think I was vindicated over time by subsequent events. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=548.4399999999999s)]
*  But here I just looked at that independent atomic energy report and I thought, what else [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=552.6s)]
*  could they possibly be doing? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=557.6s)]
*  If you enrich your uranium at that level and you have enough to build potentially 10 atomic [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=559.76s)]
*  bombs, I don't know what else Iran wanted the world to think it was doing. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=565.9599999999999s)]
*  Enough about 9 to 5, what about the most important bit, the 5 to 9? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=573.28s)]

*  Listen, I think we need to recognize that for the past 30 years Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=628.88s)]
*  has been warning the world about the Iranian nuclear threat. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=633.0s)]
*  What is different about today? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=637.36s)]
*  Listen, the excuses and the rationale that was used are the same ones that could have [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=638.84s)]
*  been used 20 years ago. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=642.72s)]
*  The fact remains, October 7th changed everything. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=645.44s)]
*  The axis of resistance and the ring of fire was a deterrent to Israel ever since it was [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=649.3s)]
*  established. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=656.68s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of weapons, hundreds of thousands of missiles and warheads were [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=657.68s)]
*  aimed at Israel and could, as was said at Thermopylae, could blot out the sky and overwhelm [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=663.2399999999999s)]
*  any kind of air defense system that the Israelis had put up. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=670.4399999999999s)]
*  Since October 7th, the Israelis have methodically taken away and torn away and destroyed most [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=675.28s)]
*  of that capability. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=682.4s)]
*  Deterrence was off. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=684.5999999999999s)]
*  This is a once in a lifetime generation for the Israelis to attack and every Israeli pilot [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=685.84s)]
*  for the past 30 years has wanted to be the first one in the cockpit to end that nuclear [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=691.64s)]
*  program. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=696.8s)]
*  The fact that the ring of fire was destroyed and it was now a manageable threat from Iran, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=697.8s)]
*  no longer deterrence, this is a once in a generation opportunity and Netanyahu took [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=705.28s)]
*  that opportunity. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=710.72s)]
*  Final question before I let you go. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=711.72s)]
*  But it wasn't Israeli pilots. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=713.68s)]
*  It was American pilots. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=715.08s)]
*  Let's be clear about that. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=716.08s)]
*  American pilots did this incredibly risky mission. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=717.2s)]
*  Luckily none of them got hurt. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=720.08s)]
*  But this is going to start a full blown war with Iran, a war that the United States should [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=721.84s)]
*  not be fighting on behalf of any foreign country, including Israel. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=726.5600000000001s)]
*  It's unacceptable. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=730.1600000000001s)]
*  Unacceptable. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=731.1600000000001s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=732.1600000000001s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=733.1600000000001s)]
*  How many years do American taxpayers and our members of our military need to be slaves [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=734.1600000000001s)]
*  to the Israeli government? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=738.84s)]
*  I need someone to answer that question. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=739.9200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=741.8000000000001s)]
*  Listen. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=742.8000000000001s)]
*  A genocidal regime. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=743.8000000000001s)]
*  General Kennedy does have to go. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=745.52s)]
*  I just want to ask you before you go, just one last question. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=746.52s)]
*  Would you as a military commander have been comfortable about what the IDF has been doing [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=749.56s)]
*  at the behest of the Israeli government in the last three months in Gaza? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=755.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, I'd rather answer the question directly of Gaspar and Loik. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=759.28s)]
*  As somebody who's worn a uniform for 30 years, the conditions that had been set by the Israeli [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=763.8399999999999s)]
*  Defense and the Israeli Air Forces and Mossad meant that this was not only the most lethal [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=771.88s)]
*  attacks since Hiroshima, but it was also the safest attack. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=777.9200000000001s)]
*  The fact remains, the IAF had wiped out the air defenses. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=782.1600000000001s)]
*  Mossad had put a lot of pressure. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=787.4s)]
*  This was the safest operation, not to include the Great Deception Plan, where President [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=790.08s)]
*  Trump used Winston Churchill's axiom that the truth is so important, it must be a bodyguard [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=798.08s)]
*  of lies. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=804.8000000000001s)]
*  And I would tell you right now, there's not an American pilot that was worried about this [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=805.8000000000001s)]
*  attack and had anything but pride for this attack. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=809.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=813.32s)]
*  And just finally, the answer to my question? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=814.32s)]
*  If it was about Gaza, again, I think that when you... [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=818.0400000000001s)]
*  I surely don't commend the killing of innocents and civilians, but you know that when the [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=823.28s)]
*  enemy wraps itself around civilian targets, civilian facilities... [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=833.16s)]
*  You support genocide. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  That facility is now no longer... [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=840.52s)]
*  You're okay with it. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=842.52s)]
*  It is now a military target. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=843.52s)]
*  I don't necessarily see at this point that it's genocide for the simple reason that the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=845.96s)]
*  Gazans and Hamas have an opportunity to end that, and that's to return the hostages and [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=851.84s)]
*  end this carnage. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=859.4s)]
*  In previous actual genocides... [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=862.16s)]
*  That's a lie, and you know it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=863.8000000000001s)]
*  You know it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=865.48s)]
*  They're shooting and killing civilians at humanitarian aid hubs, dozens of them on a [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=866.52s)]
*  daily basis. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=872.08s)]
*  literal children are getting shot in the face. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=873.08s)]
*  You're right, Pierce. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=876.08s)]
*  It is a good time. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=877.08s)]
*  It's a genocide. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=878.08s)]
*  It's a genocide. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=879.08s)]

*  No, don't interrupt me. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=924.24s)]
*  I can feel your frustration. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=925.24s)]
*  I can feel how sad you are. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=926.76s)]
*  I can feel how difficult it is for you to see Israel teaching the Iranian regime a lesson [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=929.0s)]
*  and Israel winning on the battlefield. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=935.5600000000001s)]
*  I can understand that it's frustrating for you. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=939.04s)]
*  I can understand that you're having a tough time dealing with reality. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=942.04s)]
*  I can understand that you're suffering because you are shooting and killing children at humanitarian aid hubs. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=946.04s)]
*  You genocidal prick. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=954.04s)]
*  Can you answer that question? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=955.04s)]
*  And frankly, really your talking points are tired. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=956.04s)]
*  The whole world sees you guys for what you are. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=958.04s)]
*  I'm not here to answer your questions, Mrs. Interopter. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=960.04s)]
*  I'm not here to answer your questions. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=962.04s)]
*  Last time I checked, this wasn't your channel. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=964.04s)]
*  This wasn't your channel. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=966.04s)]
*  You've done nothing but interrupt and talk nonsense. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=967.52s)]
*  You've only been talking nonsense so far and I've been sitting here and listening quite politely to your nonsense. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=970.52s)]
*  Pay for your own damn weapons. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=977.52s)]
*  Alright, guys, you need to hear individually talking. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=979.52s)]
*  Don't talk over each other. There's no point. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=982.52s)]
*  I can't stand these people and their disgusting lies. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=984.52s)]
*  As children are getting slaughtered by the dozens daily at these humanitarian aid hubs. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=986.52s)]
*  I can speak over you endlessly. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=992.52s)]
*  Anna, listen, we can't have a debate if you don't let Jonathan... [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=996.0s)]
*  What's funding this stuff? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1000.0s)]
*  Americans are forced to perform this genocide. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1002.0s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1004.0s)]
*  Let Jonathan say what he wants to say, then you can respond. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1005.0s)]
*  Piers. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1007.0s)]
*  Listen, Piers, this isn't going to work. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1009.0s)]
*  This is the same terrifying point, but okay, guys. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1011.0s)]
*  Anna, let him talk, please. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1013.0s)]
*  She's here to instigate. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1014.0s)]
*  She constantly interrupts. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1016.0s)]
*  That is not a way to have a meaningful discussion. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1018.0s)]
*  And if I ask you to kindly put her in place... [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1021.0s)]
*  Put her in place so that at least I could say two or three sentences. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1024.48s)]
*  Put her in place. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1027.48s)]
*  That's the first thing. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1028.48s)]
*  Now I can understand the frustration of so many people that are Israel haters, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1029.48s)]
*  disguising as liberals, disguising as humanitarians. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1034.48s)]
*  I can see and feel, and I even have compassion for your feelings, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1037.48s)]
*  that you see the great empire that the Iranians built against us. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1042.48s)]
*  It is being decimated piece by piece, and there is nothing you can do to stop it. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1046.48s)]
*  And it must be frustrating. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1052.96s)]
*  It must be frustrating to see Israel defend itself after Hamas attack on October 7. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1054.96s)]
*  But all those boomers are going to be gone one day, and I can't wait. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1059.96s)]
*  And it must be frustrating to see Israel persisting and winning and defeating our enemies, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1062.96s)]
*  despite the efforts of the likes of you and many others who have teamed up against Israel. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1067.96s)]
*  And I can understand the frustration, but guess what? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1072.96s)]
*  It's not going to help. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1075.96s)]
*  Your opinion isn't true. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1077.96s)]
*  It is not reality-based, just like you just said in the beginning. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1079.96s)]
*  We see the videos. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1082.44s)]
*  On the contrary, Israelis are lining up and there's actually a national airlift to get home. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1084.44s)]
*  There's an Israeli national airlift to get Israelis home from all over the world, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1090.44s)]
*  from Greece and from Cyprus, so that they can come home to be with their families as Israel is being attacked. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1096.44s)]
*  Go back to Israel, put your uniforms on, boys and girls. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1103.44s)]
*  I'm going to bring in Dinesh here, and I would appreciate it if everyone just let each other talk. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1106.44s)]
*  The viewers can't hear a damn thing. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1111.92s)]
*  Dinesh, thank you for your patience in waiting so long to speak. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1113.92s)]
*  First of all, what is your... [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1117.92s)]
*  I mean, look, there's a lot of speculation about what Donald Trump may do next. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1119.92s)]
*  I happen to think that he is instinctively anti-war. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1122.92s)]
*  I don't think there's any chance he wants to put any boots on the ground here. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1126.92s)]
*  I think if he can make it one and done with the strikes that he ordered, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1129.92s)]
*  I think he would be happy with that, as he was with the strikes against Syria, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1133.92s)]
*  against Soleimani, against Baghdadi. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1138.4s)]
*  He's a guy who likes to go in, targeted and out. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1141.4s)]
*  I don't think he wants any kind of prolonged war. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1145.4s)]
*  However, once you do something like Trump ordered at the weekend, it can be out of your hands. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1147.4s)]
*  It really depends how Iran responds. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1153.4s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen here? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1156.4s)]
*  I think that we are learning that Trump represents a repudiation of the Bush tradition, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1158.88s)]
*  but he doesn't represent a repudiation of the Reagan tradition. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1167.88s)]
*  Trump is quite willing to use force, but he uses it discriminately, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1172.88s)]
*  he uses it quickly and decisively, and Trump's own rhetoric very much supports this. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1179.88s)]
*  I think that a lot of this anxiety is because of the bad lessons that came out of the Iraq war. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1187.3600000000001s)]
*  But Iran is not Iraq, and Trump is not Bush, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1194.3600000000001s)]
*  and the fictional weapons of mass destruction in Iraq are not the same [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1199.3600000000001s)]
*  as functioning nuclear facilities enriching uranium in Iran. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1205.3600000000001s)]
*  So I think that it's important to look at this situation for what it is. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1210.84s)]
*  Now, who can argue that the world is not better off when Iran doesn't have nuclear capacity? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1216.84s)]
*  Whether there's a 50% chance that they were going to get there, a 70% chance, a 90% chance, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1223.84s)]
*  it would be really good to have a 0% chance that they could get there at all. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1229.84s)]
*  This is a fanatical militant regime. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1233.84s)]
*  It is different than places like China and Russia in that it has always had an ideology [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1237.32s)]
*  of global involvement, global destruction, global terrorism, death to America. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1243.32s)]
*  You don't have to seek for a motive here. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1250.32s)]
*  They deliver it to you from the Iranian parliament on a pretty daily basis. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1252.32s)]
*  So the United States has very definite interests here. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1257.32s)]
*  The interest is not necessarily in regime change, although I, for one, would welcome it. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1260.32s)]
*  Who can argue that Iran would not be better off than under the mullahs? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1265.8s)]
*  And I think the big losers here are, in fact, Iran, Hamas, but also the global left. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1270.8s)]
*  The global left has partnered in a way with these Hamas radicals. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1277.8s)]
*  And so they are taking a tremendous beating here. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1282.8s)]
*  All their idiotic campus protests are for naught. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1285.8s)]
*  So this is why we're getting all this screaming and hysteria from Anna, because she realizes [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1288.8s)]
*  that not only is Iran going down, so is our own ideology. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1294.28s)]
*  I don't like watching children get slaughtered by a genocidal regime that we're unfortunately [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1297.28s)]
*  funding with our taxpayer dollars and with military weapons. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1301.48s)]
*  That's what I don't like. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1304.68s)]
*  Look at Konricus. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1305.68s)]
*  Look at how flippant he is when it comes to children getting killed. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1306.68s)]
*  That's the kind of person you are, Konricus. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1309.52s)]
*  Disgusting. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1311.52s)]
*  Absolutely disgusting. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1312.52s)]
*  The international community sees it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1313.52s)]
*  And honestly, it is insane. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1314.52s)]
*  It is insane on America's reputation. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1315.52s)]
*  And we are merely funding modern day Nazis today. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1316.52s)]
*  And I think that's what we're seeing. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1317.52s)]
*  And I think that's what we're seeing. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1318.52s)]
*  And I think that's what we're seeing. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1319.52s)]
*  And I think that's what we're seeing. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1320.52s)]
*  And I think that's what we're seeing. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1321.52s)]
*  And I think that's what we're seeing. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1322.52s)]
*  Okay, Anna, you made your views about Jonathan Clear. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1324.52s)]
*  Don't interrupt me, you disgusting terrorist. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1327.52s)]
*  All right, can we try and keep things, please, less ad hominem? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1329.52s)]
*  It's a bit pointless to scream and abuse at him. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1332.52s)]
*  Let me bring in, if I may... [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1334.52s)]
*  I mean, what do you call a regime that slaughters children willy-nilly on the daily basis? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1336.52s)]
*  You can have your arguments about it. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1339.52s)]
*  What do you call that? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1340.52s)]
*  By the way, I share a lot of your arguments, but I think abusing another guest on a panel [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1341.52s)]
*  for as long as you've been doing is a bit pointless and self-defeating. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1344.52s)]
*  I don't think viewers like it. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1347.52s)]
*  You don't think he deserves a little bit of abuse, considering what he's been doing wrong? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1348.52s)]
*  Sure. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1351.52s)]
*  You've given him more than a little bit of abuse. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1353.24s)]
*  I actually do not. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1355.24s)]
*  Let me bring in... [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1356.24s)]
*  And I actually stand for myself. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1357.24s)]
*  Let me bring in another guest who hasn't said a word. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1358.24s)]
*  You're a terrorist. You're disgusting. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1360.24s)]
*  Let me bring in Kaveh Afrasiabi. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1361.24s)]
*  I mean, the big question I would have for Iran is, why were you enriching uranium to [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1364.24s)]
*  60% if you had no intention of building nuclear weapons to a weaponized degree? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1370.24s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1375.24s)]
*  Mr. Morgan, I'm very unhappy with how you mischaracterized me a minute ago. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1378.96s)]
*  I was not charged as a spy for Iran. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1383.96s)]
*  I was an international affairs consultant for Iran's mission for 13 years under UN norms [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1386.96s)]
*  and guidelines. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1393.96s)]
*  And in the last 24 hours of the first Trump administration, he decided that I'm in violation [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1394.96s)]
*  of U.S. law and brought these phony charges against me. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1400.96s)]
*  What I was doing was in line with all the other consultants for other country missions, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1405.68s)]
*  none of whom have registered as a foreign agent. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1409.68s)]
*  Everything I said was accurate. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1412.68s)]
*  Everything I said was accurate. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1414.68s)]
*  No, no, you are not accurate and you're not putting yourself up in legal... [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1416.68s)]
*  Well, you were accused of spying and you weren't pardoned by Joe Biden. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1420.68s)]
*  I was not accused of being a spy and I would bring a major defamation lawsuit on you. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1424.68s)]
*  Fine, let me ask you two questions. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1428.68s)]
*  Let me answer your question. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1430.68s)]
*  Let me ask you two questions. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1432.68s)]
*  I will bring a major... [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1435.4s)]
*  Can you stop talking? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1437.4s)]
*  I am out of Harvard for 30 years. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1439.4s)]
*  I'm in the Supreme Court against Harvard right now. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1441.4s)]
*  And I will bring a major lawsuit on you. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1443.4s)]
*  I'm sure you will. I look forward to receiving it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1445.4s)]
*  Let me ask you two... [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1447.4s)]
*  Let me answer your question. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1449.4s)]
*  Let me ask you two questions first. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1451.4s)]
*  Is it true that you were accused of spying? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1453.4s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1455.4s)]
*  You were? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1457.4s)]
*  No, I was not. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1459.4s)]
*  What were you accused of? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1461.4s)]
*  I was accused of successfully... [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1464.1200000000001s)]
*  I said, is it true you were accused of spying? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1466.1200000000001s)]
*  Is it true you were accused of it? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1468.1200000000001s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1470.1200000000001s)]
*  I was accused of violating the 14th Agent Registration Act, FARA, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1472.1200000000001s)]
*  which requires registration, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1478.1200000000001s)]
*  but not for people who work under the UN mandate, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1480.1200000000001s)]
*  which is what I was doing. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1484.1200000000001s)]
*  I was arrested for 24 hours. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1486.1200000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1488.1200000000001s)]
*  I denied the charges. I represented myself. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1490.1200000000001s)]
*  Fine. I didn't say you were found guilty. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1492.84s)]
*  No, you accused me of being working as a spy for Iran, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1494.84s)]
*  which is an outrageous lie. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1498.84s)]
*  I didn't accuse you of anything. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1500.84s)]
*  No, you said that I've been charged with being a spy. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1502.84s)]
*  No, I didn't. I said you were accused of it. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1504.84s)]
*  Yes, you did. You're a damn liar. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1506.84s)]
*  I did not say that. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1508.84s)]
*  All these other weaknesses, the whole world heard you. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1510.84s)]
*  I did not say that. And when you watch this back, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1512.84s)]
*  you will regret your outburst because you misheard me. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1514.84s)]
*  No, I will bring a major lawsuit on your head. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1516.84s)]
*  You're just waiting for me. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1518.84s)]
*  I couldn't give a damn. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1521.56s)]
*  You know, I'm a plaintiff against Harvard. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1523.56s)]
*  I represented myself for 30 years. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1525.56s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1527.56s)]
*  Do you want to do an interview or not? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1529.56s)]
*  I'm in the US Supreme Court. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1531.56s)]
*  Do you want to do an interview about what's happening or not? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1533.56s)]
*  Or do you want to keep shouting? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1535.56s)]
*  OK, I will answer your question. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1537.56s)]
*  Well, answer it then. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1539.56s)]
*  First, what the US did was a violation of the IAEA statute [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1541.56s)]
*  prohibiting armed strikes against nuclear facilities, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1545.56s)]
*  and then being immediately condemned by the governing board of the IAEA. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1550.28s)]
*  Just as the EU 10 days ago issued a statement at the IAEA. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1554.28s)]
*  But that wasn't my question, was it? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1556.28s)]
*  That wasn't my question. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1558.28s)]
*  You said you were going to answer my question. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1560.28s)]
*  You're not answering my question. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1562.28s)]
*  My question was why did Iran enrich its uranium stocks to 60%? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1564.28s)]
*  That is my question. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1570.28s)]
*  OK, I answer you by, first of all, pointing out that what you said [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1572.28s)]
*  that the IAEA says that there's no other purpose for it. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1577.0s)]
*  It's a lie. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1579.0s)]
*  There's no such a thing in IAEA report. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1581.0s)]
*  The IAEA report of March 2025 says, and I quote, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1583.0s)]
*  since February 2025, Iran has been facilitating [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1589.0s)]
*  the implementation of a strengthened safeguard at its facilities. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1593.0s)]
*  Now, is that the profile of a nuclear profile? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1597.0s)]
*  And then came another report that said that Iran was obfuscating [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1599.0s)]
*  not allowing access to international supervisors. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1603.0s)]
*  Let me answer. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1605.72s)]
*  Let's not forget the last report of the Board of Governors. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1607.72s)]
*  60% of the nonproliferation treaty. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1609.72s)]
*  How about you, Dhanak? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1611.72s)]
*  OK, go ahead. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1613.72s)]
*  60% enrichment has medical uses. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1615.72s)]
*  Oh, are you running the show, Mrs. Angry Screaming Lady? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1617.72s)]
*  It is not a representative violation of the IAEA safeguards. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1619.72s)]
*  All the facilities that were bombed were under international safeguards. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1625.72s)]
*  And it should have been condemned immediately [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1631.72s)]
*  because it's also a violation of the UN Charter [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1634.44s)]
*  because Iran has not threatened the US. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1636.44s)]
*  US engaged in a unilateral act of militarism against Iran. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1638.44s)]
*  Your leader, your supreme leader, has lived for me. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1642.44s)]
*  Are we going to get to an answer [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1644.44s)]
*  why the Iranian regime was enriching to military-grade uranium? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1646.44s)]
*  Are we going to hear why, Mr. Negotiator? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1650.44s)]
*  And again, I hold you in high respect because I think you [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1652.44s)]
*  and the people like you, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1654.44s)]
*  I think you have done a tremendous amount of damage. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1656.44s)]
*  Who are you to talk about that? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1658.44s)]
*  You have nuclear weapons. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1660.44s)]
*  You're not even acknowledging. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1663.16s)]
*  A tremendous outstanding job. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1665.16s)]
*  For 25 years, you have facilitated for the Iranian regime [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1667.16s)]
*  to develop nuclear weapons [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1671.16s)]
*  and it is through the skill and rhetoric of people like you [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1673.16s)]
*  that this has gone on for so long. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1676.16s)]
*  But can we get to the answer [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1678.16s)]
*  why the Iranian regime is enriching? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1680.16s)]
*  And you think that it can come and dictate [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1683.16s)]
*  to a country 80 times its size? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1685.16s)]
*  You're hallucinating. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1687.16s)]
*  Can we get to an answer of why your regime is enriching to military-grade? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1689.16s)]
*  Let me ask you. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1691.88s)]
*  Does Israel have nuclear weapons? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1693.88s)]
*  Does Israel have the right to have nuclear weapons? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1695.88s)]
*  Does Israel have nuclear weapons? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1699.88s)]
*  Does Israel have the slightest by the inspection of its facilities? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1701.88s)]
*  Does Israel have the slightest by the inspection of its facilities? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1703.88s)]
*  You are such a hypocrite. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1705.88s)]
*  You think that Israel is exceptional, is a chosen people? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1707.88s)]
*  The last report of the Atomic Agency Board of Governors stated clearly [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1709.88s)]
*  No. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1711.88s)]
*  No. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1713.88s)]
*  No. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1715.88s)]
*  No. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1717.88s)]
*  Iran is not allowing international inspectors to come and see [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1720.6000000000001s)]
*  and Iran has enough fissile material for 10 nuclear bombs. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1724.6000000000001s)]
*  That was the smoking gun that eventually caused [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1728.6000000000001s)]
*  President Trump to understand the severity of the situation. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1731.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1733.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes, and that was what tipped the scales. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1735.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, you just... [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1737.6000000000001s)]
*  That was what tipped the scales. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1739.6000000000001s)]
*  Let me ask a question. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1741.6000000000001s)]
*  If you all talk over each other, nobody can hear a word anybody says. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1743.6000000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you, Mr. Al-Aqsa. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1745.6000000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you, Mr. Al-Aqsa. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1747.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm from CRB. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1750.32s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1752.32s)]
*  Do you deny, for the record, that Iran has sponsored terrorism [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1754.32s)]
*  through Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah going back several decades? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1758.32s)]
*  I've been very critical of Iran's support for Hamas. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1765.32s)]
*  I wrote an article right after October 17, USA Today, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1769.32s)]
*  denouncing Hamas' ISIS-type attack on innocent civilians [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1774.32s)]
*  I've been very critical of Iran's obsession with Israel [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1780.04s)]
*  in various books, including Trump and Iran Right Behind Me, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1784.04s)]
*  which has been highly praised in foreign affairs, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1788.04s)]
*  as well as many other articles. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1791.04s)]
*  I have called on Iran to stop its Israelphobia, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1794.04s)]
*  because it's not in the national interest of Iran [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1798.04s)]
*  to be so obsessed with Israel, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1801.04s)]
*  which incidentally, in 1984, I've written a book [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1803.04s)]
*  on an Israeli operative, Amiram Nir, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1807.76s)]
*  who was singularly responsible for shipping out missiles [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1810.76s)]
*  to Iran, defending against Saddam Hussein. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1814.76s)]
*  Iran should be thankful to Israel for the support [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1817.76s)]
*  that was given to it to safeguard it against Saddam Hussein. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1820.76s)]
*  You've now said something. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1823.76s)]
*  If you don't mind me being... [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1825.76s)]
*  You've now said something genuinely interesting and surprising [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1827.76s)]
*  and constructive to the debate, right? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1830.76s)]
*  You've acknowledged that Iran should not have been sponsoring [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1833.76s)]
*  terrorism with groups that are wedded to eradicating Israel [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1836.76s)]
*  off the face of the Earth. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1841.76s)]
*  And that's been the problem. Absolutely not. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1843.76s)]
*  And Iran should have never said [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1845.76s)]
*  that Israel should be wiped off the map. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1847.76s)]
*  It's contrary to Iran's national interest. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1849.76s)]
*  The mullahs have done a lot of things wrong, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1852.76s)]
*  and I'm on record... [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1855.76s)]
*  Well, that's good to hear you say it. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1857.76s)]
*  Huh? That's good to hear you say that. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1859.76s)]
*  No, but I cooperated selectively with Iran [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1861.76s)]
*  for the sake of a nuclear agreement, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1864.76s)]
*  which was a win-win and non-proliferation net plus. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1866.76s)]
*  And President Trump made a terrible mistake [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1870.76s)]
*  under Netanyahu's pressure to withdraw, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1873.76s)]
*  to set the stage for today's invasion. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1876.76s)]
*  The problem is... I've got to jump in, you'll be running out of time. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1878.76s)]
*  But the problem is that the last report made it clear [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1881.76s)]
*  that the Iranian regime has been obfuscating and lying [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1884.76s)]
*  and hiding staff and stopping them from doing their job. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1888.76s)]
*  So you have a significantly enriched uranium program going on, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1891.76s)]
*  going up nearer and nearer to weapons grade, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1895.76s)]
*  and then not allowing the inspectors to do their job. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1898.76s)]
*  You put the two and two things together, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1901.76s)]
*  and you get four if you add two and two together. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1903.76s)]
*  Let me ask Dinesh... No, you're wrong. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1906.76s)]
*  Hang on, hang on. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1908.76s)]
*  Hang on, Dinesh, you wanted to say something quickly. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1910.76s)]
*  I wanted to make a point about the issue of [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1913.76s)]
*  who is responsible for what. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1916.76s)]
*  Now, when regimes start wars, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1918.76s)]
*  they are responsible for the fate of their own children. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1921.76s)]
*  I mean, if I come and do a home invasion on you, right, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1924.76s)]
*  and threaten your children, and you strike back, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1928.76s)]
*  and then I go grab my own kids and stick them in front of me [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1931.76s)]
*  and say, don't shoot, don't shoot, because I'm holding my own kids, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1934.76s)]
*  the truth of it is I am putting my kids in jeopardy, not you. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1938.76s)]
*  You have every right to retaliate against me. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1942.76s)]
*  And I am the one... You better use that standard [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1945.76s)]
*  when Israeli civilians get killed. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1947.76s)]
*  I am the one who is putting those civilians in danger. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1949.76s)]
*  You better use the same standard, but you won't. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1952.76s)]
*  Hang on. You won't use the same standard. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1955.76s)]
*  Let me finish. I want to hold the panel here for two minutes. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1957.76s)]
*  I want to just have a quick conversation with Ambassador John Bolton, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1960.76s)]
*  the National Security Advisor to Donald Trump during his first term. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1963.76s)]
*  Mr Bolton, thank you for joining me. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1966.76s)]
*  I realise you only have a few minutes here. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1968.76s)]
*  I'm not a war-monger. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1970.76s)]
*  You can just tell me, what is your assessment of where we are right now? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1972.76s)]
*  You have the Israeli strikes, now the American strikes, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1976.76s)]
*  many people fearing that Iran is going to react in a spectacular fashion [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1980.76s)]
*  by way of retaliation. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1985.76s)]
*  Others think their capability to do that has been severely diminished. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1987.76s)]
*  People fearing there may have to be a ground invasion and so on. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1991.76s)]
*  Where do you think we really are here? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1994.76s)]
*  Well, I think we've made a good first start [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1997.76s)]
*  in destroying the Iranian nuclear weapons programme [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=1999.76s)]
*  and its ballistic missile programme. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2002.76s)]
*  I wish the US and Israel had gone in together much earlier, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2004.76s)]
*  but we are where we are. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2007.76s)]
*  The president finally made the right decision. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2008.76s)]
*  Now is the time to finish the job. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2010.76s)]
*  And finishing the job, to me, means overthrowing the Ayatollahs. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2012.76s)]
*  There's not going to be peace and security in the Middle East [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2015.76s)]
*  while this regime is in power. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2018.76s)]
*  The president, I don't think is there yet, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2020.76s)]
*  although he's beginning to signal maybe he is. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2022.76s)]
*  It doesn't require boots on the ground. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2024.76s)]
*  There are lots of ways to get the regime changed. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2026.76s)]
*  The population is extraordinarily dissatisfied with the Ayatollahs. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2028.76s)]
*  And I think you could see fragmentation at the top. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2032.76s)]
*  That kind of instability is what you need to bring the regime down. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2035.76s)]
*  But isn't the lesson we've learned from Iraq and Afghanistan, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2038.76s)]
*  wherever we try to affect regime changes, it tends not to work? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2041.76s)]
*  And then, in fact, the most effective way is to allow the people of a country, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2046.76s)]
*  as we saw with Syria last December, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2050.76s)]
*  actually doing the regime change themselves. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2053.76s)]
*  Isn't that the... [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2056.76s)]
*  I mean, I think, actually, that's what Donald Trump was indicating in his tweet. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2057.76s)]
*  I think that he was indicating a regime change coming from within, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2061.76s)]
*  from the dissatisfied people of Iran, as you rightly put it. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2066.76s)]
*  Not that there should be American interference [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2069.76s)]
*  facilitating any kind of regime change. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2071.76s)]
*  Well, there are two aspects to this. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2074.76s)]
*  First is the removal of the existing authoritarian regime. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2075.76s)]
*  And second is the creation of the substitute. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2079.76s)]
*  I think we did the right thing in removing the Taliban [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2081.76s)]
*  and the right thing in removing Saddam Hussein. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2083.76s)]
*  And in Syria, the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group didn't prevail over Assad [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2086.76s)]
*  without extraordinary Turkish help. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2091.76s)]
*  So that's how it goes. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2093.76s)]
*  Now the question is, how do the people of the country affected [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2094.76s)]
*  establish their own regime? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2097.76s)]
*  And it clearly is the case that they should be primarily responsible. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2099.76s)]
*  I said back at the time of the overthrow of Saddam Hussein [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2102.76s)]
*  that the U.S. role should be to hold the ring around the outside, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2106.76s)]
*  prevent the Iranians from interfering, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2109.76s)]
*  and basically say to the people of Iraq, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2111.76s)]
*  here's a copy of the Federalist Papers. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2113.76s)]
*  This may be helpful to you. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2115.76s)]
*  Why don't you form your own government? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2116.76s)]
*  You don't enhance political maturation [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2118.76s)]
*  by making decisions for other people. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2120.76s)]
*  You enhance political maturation by making them make decisions [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2122.76s)]
*  for themselves, including mistakes from which they learn. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2126.76s)]
*  Donald Trump is making slightly ambiguous statements at the moment. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2130.76s)]
*  Would you want him to be clearer about his intentions, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2135.76s)]
*  or is this all part of him not letting the other side know [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2140.76s)]
*  what he really wants to do? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2143.76s)]
*  Well, I don't think he knows what he really wants to do. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2145.76s)]
*  I think he's just going around the circle now [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2147.76s)]
*  to see what he can come up with. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2149.76s)]
*  But as others have observed, one very important change [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2150.76s)]
*  that I think he's making is yesterday the vice president said, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2153.76s)]
*  we do not want regime change in Iran. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2157.76s)]
*  That is absolutely wrong. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2160.76s)]
*  We should want regime change. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2162.76s)]
*  How much we do is a different story. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2163.76s)]
*  And I think Trump obviously is not going to contemplate [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2166.76s)]
*  putting troops in. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2169.76s)]
*  But I want to say again, there are a lot of ways to achieve regime change. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2170.76s)]
*  None of them involve boots on the ground necessarily. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2173.76s)]
*  This is a different context. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2176.76s)]
*  You have a very educated population in Iraq. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2177.76s)]
*  The young people, 60% are under 30. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2180.76s)]
*  They know they could have a different life. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2183.76s)]
*  They can see it across the Gulf, in Dubai, in Abu Dhabi, in Doha. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2184.76s)]
*  I think things would move in a very positive direction [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2188.76s)]
*  without particularly significant US involvement. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2191.76s)]
*  Ambassador Bolton, I appreciate you joining me. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2195.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2196.76s)]
*  I know you're going to be busy today. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2197.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2198.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2199.76s)]
*  Anikas Berend, here's my sort of issue, I guess, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2200.76s)]
*  with a lot of people on the left in relation to this story. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2202.76s)]
*  Is that you end up sounding like you're siding... [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2206.76s)]
*  Hang on one second, please. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2210.76s)]
*  Please allow me to talk to different members of the panel. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2211.76s)]
*  Is it on the left you end up sounding like you're shilling for a vile regime? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2215.76s)]
*  The Iranian regime oppresses women... [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2223.76s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2225.76s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2226.76s)]
*  They are oppressing women... [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2227.76s)]
*  I know what you're going to say. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2228.76s)]
*  I know. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2229.76s)]
*  I hate the regime in Iran. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2230.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2232.76s)]
*  I hate the regime in Iran. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2233.76s)]
*  So why wouldn't you want it changing? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2234.76s)]
*  I hate the mullahs. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2235.76s)]
*  There are Armenians living in Iran right now who hate the mullahs. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2236.76s)]
*  Okay, but regime change should not be spurred by the United States and Israel, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2239.76s)]
*  which wants to install a puppet government on their behalf. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2245.76s)]
*  And by the way, the Iranians know that. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2249.76s)]
*  They know that polling indicates the vast majority of them want regime change. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2251.76s)]
*  They don't want it to be done by Israel. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2256.76s)]
*  You have to be clear about that because I think there's an intentional mis-framing [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2259.76s)]
*  or false framing of what's happening in Iran right now and what the population actually wants. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2264.76s)]
*  Now, with that out of the way, my issue, Pierce, is that the United States has been [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2270.76s)]
*  expending its resources and has been essentially sending its soldiers to die in wars on behalf of Israel, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2275.76s)]
*  a country that goaded us into invading Iraq on a false pretense of weapons of mass destruction. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2284.76s)]
*  Four thousand of our soldiers died in Iraq. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2292.76s)]
*  You didn't send a single IDF soldier. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2295.76s)]
*  Not one IDF soldier was sent to Iraq. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2297.76s)]
*  Our soldiers died on your behalf, Kunrikis, on your country's behalf. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2300.76s)]
*  And I'm sick of it. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2304.76s)]
*  I'm sick of it. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2305.76s)]
*  You guys are committing a genocide right now, yet you're a nuclear power that's not in the [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2306.76s)]
*  non-proliferation agreement. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2311.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2312.76s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2313.76s)]
*  How come you guys get to play by completely different rules? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2314.76s)]
*  You're genocidal, you're disgusting, the world sees you guys for what you are. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2317.76s)]
*  You are the people of Israel? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2322.76s)]
*  You're not the government of Israel. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2324.76s)]
*  You're a genocidal government. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2326.76s)]
*  You guys make me sick. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2328.76s)]
*  You make me sick. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2329.76s)]
*  You make me sick. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2330.76s)]
*  The entire international community looks at your government and gets sick even thinking about it. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2332.76s)]
*  We know that he makes you sick, but let him answer. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2338.76s)]
*  For God's sake, we're trying to have a conversation here. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2342.76s)]
*  The history books will write about your government the way that Americans read about the Nazis today. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2344.76s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2349.76s)]
*  Instead of just screaming at me and looking like a lunatic who just keeps on screaming at other people, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2350.76s)]
*  could you for a second allow me to say two sentences? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2356.76s)]
*  All those children who were born in Gaza in an open-air prison and had to die in Gaza because of your disgusting, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2360.76s)]
*  You're a talk show host and you don't represent anybody. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2368.76s)]
*  You've never stood for anything. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2370.76s)]
*  You've never fought for anything. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2372.76s)]
*  You're a talk show host and you don't represent anybody. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2373.76s)]
*  And the fact that you think that it's effective to accuse me of all kinds of nonsense and you think that that will rattle me, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2376.76s)]
*  I'm sorry to disappoint you. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2383.76s)]
*  Many and better people before you have tried and they have all failed. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2384.76s)]
*  But let me tell you something. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2388.76s)]
*  Your hatred is so showing. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2390.76s)]
*  Your hatred of Israel is blinding you. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2392.76s)]
*  You're not able to distinguish between different situations. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2395.76s)]
*  You're a terrorist. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2399.76s)]
*  And you find yourself supporting a genocidal regime just out of your burning hatred towards Israel. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2400.76s)]
*  And I think that is so compelling for people to see. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2406.76s)]
*  I hate the government. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2410.76s)]
*  Don't all start talking. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2411.76s)]
*  Otherwise I'm going to literally give up. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2413.76s)]
*  All right. Let me just, look. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2415.76s)]
*  And I feel bad for the people of Israel who are not under attack because of the belligerence of your government and military. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2416.76s)]
*  Let me ask Carvey this question. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2422.76s)]
*  Carvey, in an ideal world, Carvey, do you think it's right, as John Bolton said, that the young population... [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2423.76s)]
*  This isn't fair. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2430.76s)]
*  She's been screaming over me the entire conversation. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2431.76s)]
*  I've said one sentence and I've been sitting here for 45 minutes. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2433.76s)]
*  I agree. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2437.76s)]
*  I would really like to say one sentence without her screaming like some crazy person. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2438.76s)]
*  Totally, totally... [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2442.76s)]
*  Let's see if she'll let you. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2444.76s)]
*  Totally consumed by her hatred. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2445.76s)]
*  You guys are such victims. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2447.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2448.76s)]
*  I would like to say one thing. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2449.76s)]
*  The young woman speaking over me. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2450.76s)]
*  Could you contain yourself for 20 seconds? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2452.76s)]
*  Could you contain yourself for 20 seconds, please? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2455.76s)]
*  Like you've been screaming and ranting all over this debate and it's not meaningful. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2458.76s)]
*  People don't hear what you say. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2462.76s)]
*  I have a miserable reaction to people like you. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2463.76s)]
*  Nobody makes sense of it. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2465.76s)]
*  Please, do me a favor and allow me at least to say two sentences. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2466.76s)]
*  The Iranian regime now is struggling like any dictatorship with a new and dynamic situation. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2471.76s)]
*  They're not used to not being in the driving seat. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2477.76s)]
*  They're not used to not dictating an event. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2480.76s)]
*  And for the first time in 25 years, Israel is taking the initiative. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2482.76s)]
*  And Israel has now peeled back the layers of the ring of fire around Israel. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2487.76s)]
*  And Israel is, yes, and I can say this not officially as a spokesperson, but this is what I understand. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2491.76s)]
*  Israel definitely is trying to bring about regime change in Iran. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2497.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2501.76s)]
*  Because it would be better for the entire region, for the Iranian people, and definitely for Israel. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2502.76s)]
*  But many people, Jonathan, many people also think there should be regime change in Israel because of what it's been doing in Gaza. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2508.76s)]
*  So there's a lot of talk of regime change. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2516.76s)]
*  That's called elections. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2518.76s)]
*  Generally. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2519.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, OK. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2520.76s)]
*  But that's called elections. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2521.76s)]
*  And I have many friends, friends and family who fear that the regime will be a threat to Israel. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2523.76s)]
*  And luckily for Israel, luckily for us who live here, and luckily for the two million Arabs who live in Israel, Israel is a democracy. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2531.76s)]
*  We get to vote and we get to vote what we like. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2539.76s)]
*  Currently, we have a government who I think is definitely should be criticized for many things and how it has managed those situations since October 7. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2541.76s)]
*  But I think the government and the prime minister have done a great job of doing that. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2550.76s)]
*  Well, Mr. Morgan, it is abundantly clear that two nuclear armed states are yanking up on another nuclear power plant. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2554.76s)]
*  And I think that's a very good thing for the future of the region. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2563.76s)]
*  And I think that's a very good thing for the future of the region. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2566.76s)]
*  And I think that's a very good thing for the future of the region. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2569.76s)]
*  And I think that's a very good thing for the future of the region. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2571.76s)]
*  And I think that's a very good thing for the future of the region. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2573.76s)]
*  And I think that's a very good thing for the future of the region. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2575.76s)]
*  And I think that's a very good thing for the future of the region. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2577.76s)]
*  Two nuclear armed states are yanking up on another state, the regional rival, using a lame excuse of proliferation in order to cause regime change, partly because Iran is part of a new multipolar world, a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, part of the BRICS nation. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2579.76s)]
*  And the United States has been seeking a rollback of the historic Iranian Revolution for 46 years and now are seizing on this opportunity in a very systematic fashion using their mouthpieces, such as your guests here, in order to provide the state setting for this rollback strategy. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2602.76s)]
*  And all these spinners like the war monger who Mr. Trump himself labeled as a war monger who didn't like a war that didn't start in the world is not sharing Mr. Trump because Mr. Trump is exercising, implementing his script for regime change in Iran. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2624.76s)]
*  This is a tragedy of international law, the violation of the UN Charter. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2644.76s)]
*  Most of the world leaders have condemned it. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2650.76s)]
*  And Iran, by the way, has paralyzed the building. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2653.76s)]
*  Actually, I don't think that's true. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2656.76s)]
*  Israel's economy is paralyzed. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2658.76s)]
*  I don't think it's true that most world leaders have condemned it at all. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2660.76s)]
*  And you talk about regime change. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2664.76s)]
*  Look at the destructions in Tel Aviv that's making Tel Aviv into another Gaza. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2676.76s)]
*  You are hallucinating. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2682.76s)]
*  You are hallucinating. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2684.76s)]
*  Israel, the tiny inconsequential. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2686.76s)]
*  Israel, the tiny inconsequential. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2690.76s)]
*  I've got to end it there. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2692.76s)]
*  Because honestly, honestly, honestly, I am completely and utterly. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2694.76s)]
*  You are hallucinating. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2699.76s)]
*  I tell you what, I'm hallucinating. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2701.76s)]
*  I am hallucinating. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2703.76s)]
*  I am hallucinating. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2705.76s)]
*  You talk about regime change. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2707.76s)]
*  The only regime change that will be the genocide of Korea. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2709.76s)]
*  That's the only regime change. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2715.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2717.76s)]
*  I am hallucinating. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2718.76s)]
*  I'm exhausted. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2719.76s)]
*  I'm bringing it to an end. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2720.76s)]
*  Thank you all very much. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2721.76s)]
*  Joining me now is former Israeli Prime Minister and former IDF Chief of Staff Ehud Barak, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2723.76s)]
*  Israel's former Prime Minister, Defense Minister and IDF Chief of Staff. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2727.76s)]
*  Mr. Barak, thank you very much indeed for joining me again on Uncensored. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2731.76s)]
*  We're going to talk about Gaza in a moment. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2735.76s)]
*  But first of all, what was your reaction when you heard that Israel had initially launched an attack on Iran? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2738.76s)]
*  Because that must have been something that you had contemplated yourself when you were Prime Minister. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2744.76s)]
*  First of all, I was not surprised, of course, when the air was in the air for a long time. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2750.76s)]
*  But the results of the first day and the eight days is extremely impressive. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2755.76s)]
*  The farsighted planning, the accurate preparation, the resolute execution, everything that was like in October 7 [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2761.76s)]
*  was there. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2772.76s)]
*  And it has a very good impact on the deterrence of Israel, on the respect to it among neighbors in the world, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2773.76s)]
*  even the self-confidence of the public in the capabilities of its own defense forces and of the leadership. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2782.76s)]
*  So it's basically positive as long as we assume and I believe and hope that the information provided is accurate, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2789.76s)]
*  namely that there was a compelling need to do it, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2797.76s)]
*  namely that there was a genuine intelligence material proving that Iranians trying or starting the rush toward weaponization of their military nuclear program. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2800.76s)]
*  I think that for the last 48 hours made the world and the region in even better situations. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2812.76s)]
*  America intervened in a concrete and focused target. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2820.76s)]
*  I think that is an important signal even to put it in the cramming regarding to whatever Moldova or the Latvians and even [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2826.76s)]
*  Beijing about the island or Taiwan. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2834.76s)]
*  It's a good message that America cannot just talk heptically and in a non-consistent manner, but also order action. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2838.76s)]
*  Yeah, and I think what you touched on there is very significant that it really comes down, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2849.76s)]
*  I guess, to whether people believe that Iran was planning to weaponize its enriched uranium, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2854.76s)]
*  to which I've said to people, well, if it wasn't, then why would it need to take the enrichment of its uranium stocks from three and a half percent to 60 percent? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2861.76s)]
*  There's only one reason that you would need to do that, and that is if you're preparing to weaponize it, isn't it? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2872.76s)]
*  Look, there is no doubt that Iran intends to reach nuclear military capabilities. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2878.76s)]
*  They're trying to walk in the footsteps of North Korea in a way, kind of Pakistan, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2884.76s)]
*  not to repeat the mistakes of Gaddafi capitulating after Lockerbie or the black South Africa, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2891.76s)]
*  capitulating their aspiration during the change of regime and not risking a surgical attack like Israel's kind of launch on Saddam in 1881 [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2903.76s)]
*  and later on a generation later on on Assad Jr. in 2007. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2918.76s)]
*  So basically they are trying to follow in the footsteps of North Korea and they are doing it very systematically and bypassing the tweaking. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2924.76s)]
*  But having said that, they were at 2018 when Trump went out of the JCPOA under encouragement from Netanyahu. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2934.76s)]
*  They were 18 months afar from a state threshold nuclear state as a result of American withdrawing from the agreement. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2944.76s)]
*  There are now 18 days or probably minus 18 days. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2957.76s)]
*  They are basically there and there is a major problem here. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2960.76s)]
*  We are now in the enthusiasm of the obliteration of whatever for do and that's not accurate. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2964.76s)]
*  If you talk tomorrow to professionals, they will tell you that neither Israel, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2974.76s)]
*  Israel cannot delay the coming to nuclear weapons or nuclear demonstration somewhere in the desert of the capacity to have a nuclear reaction. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2980.76s)]
*  We cannot delay them by more than several weeks and the Americans cannot delay them by more than several months because they have the material. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=2991.76s)]
*  They have the know how they have the scientists in spite of elimination of 14 of them. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3000.76s)]
*  Iran is a scientific power. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3006.76s)]
*  I follow physics for them. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3008.76s)]
*  My personal background and the amount of publication in physics, including nuclear physics by Iranian scientists is amazing. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3010.76s)]
*  Much bigger than the Israeli. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3019.76s)]
*  I hope not more than the UK contributes. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3021.76s)]
*  So I don't think that they have any any physical obstacle. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3024.76s)]
*  I hope that for do was destroyed more than we can see from the satellite for sure. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3029.76s)]
*  But that's not the case. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3035.76s)]
*  You can reach the 450 kilograms of enrichment to 60 percent to do it to 90 plus, which is a weapon grade within two weeks having several hundreds of centuries in some garage and some deserted mine somewhere in Iran. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3039.76s)]
*  We cannot we do not do not pretend to know everything about Iran. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3062.76s)]
*  If they are too sophisticated for this, I accurately vividly remember the running after the North Korean or the Pakistani or even those who remember running after Israel in the 60s by the Kennedy administration. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3066.76s)]
*  In retrospect, you always find that the country was determined to reach nuclear capability found itself always ahead of the best estimates of foreign intelligence system. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3082.76s)]
*  So we have to be careful. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3095.76s)]
*  I see four scenarios. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3097.76s)]
*  Now, one a Trump joined hands with Israel with the denied objective of toppling the regime. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3099.76s)]
*  It's probably a good wish for Israel. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3108.76s)]
*  But I don't believe that is there. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3111.76s)]
*  I think that Trump is for the one shot and hopefully not being attacked by Iran and responded in Qatar. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3114.76s)]
*  And a huge American base in the second possibility is that a weekend and in a way, vulnerable, vulnerable, somewhat, somewhat even humiliated, which is not helpful in this situation. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3122.76s)]
*  Iran will come to the negotiating table and hopefully a agreement, which is a somewhat better insert from the JCPOA might be achieved. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3141.76s)]
*  Once again, we have to remember that in the previous one, they were held 18 months from being the pressure. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3153.76s)]
*  Now, in order to do this, you have to do them to agree to probably take all these and reach uranium to Russia on the commitment that they will not give them back unless certain terms have been achieved or conditions came to materialize. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3159.76s)]
*  So that's the other for me. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3177.76s)]
*  It's a good, good, good possibility for both Israel and the region. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3179.76s)]
*  The third one is that we will end up in a triton war between Israel and Iran. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3183.76s)]
*  Our Air Force, again, their missiles. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3189.76s)]
*  Americans might help us with munitions for the jets and probably some help in defense with their anti-missile. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3191.76s)]
*  The risk is that our interceptors, including the Americans, will dilute before the Iranian missile. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3199.76s)]
*  They still have 2000. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3208.76s)]
*  There is shortage of launchers because we hit the launchers back. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3209.76s)]
*  Bearing in mind the new access study from Russia, Iran, North Korea, China, you might think carefully. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3214.76s)]
*  Iran has sent thousands of missiles, short range, for Russia in order to be using against Kiev. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3221.76s)]
*  But it's not inconceivable that Iran will draw missiles from North Korea, probably with launchers, probably with some cruisers. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3231.76s)]
*  They sent soldiers to Lugansk and Donetsk so they can send the launchers to Tehran or from Pakistan or even from China. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3240.76s)]
*  So it's a very bad option for Israel. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3252.76s)]
*  I hope also for Iran, but I cannot be sure. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3255.76s)]
*  The last and the worst possibility is that the Iranian conclusion will be that the only reason that the Israeli Air Force is flying over Tehran so freely is that they did not make the decision to turn into nuclear, throw the handcuffing of the MPT and turn nuclear several years ago. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3260.76s)]
*  And they might reach the conclusion or the argument that they were attacked by Israel, which is according to foreign sources and nuclear power, backed by a well-known nuclear superpower. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3283.76s)]
*  And they have no choice but to turn power themselves. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3298.76s)]
*  But under this scenario, we might find themselves trying, falsely and justifiably, to delay the Iranian coming to nuclear capability. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3301.76s)]
*  We might end up under certain circumstances advancing or accelerating it. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3312.76s)]
*  That's a fascinating summary of all the potential outcomes. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3319.76s)]
*  I really appreciate the detail you showed there. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3323.76s)]
*  Just before we finish, I want to ask you about... [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3326.76s)]
*  I was afraid that you would say I won't understand your question, so I tried to answer you. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3329.76s)]
*  No, no, I thought you painted... [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3335.76s)]
*  Speak English slower. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3337.76s)]
*  Yeah, I will. I will. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3339.76s)]
*  You painted a very good picture of all the potential outcomes, and I appreciate that. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3340.76s)]
*  I just want to, before we finish, ask you about Gaza. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3346.76s)]
*  It seems to me that Israel has been very strategic and precise and targeted in the way that it went after Hezbollah. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3350.76s)]
*  It's been very strategic and precise and targeted in the way it's attacked Iran so far. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3360.76s)]
*  And yet in Gaza, it's been completely different. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3366.76s)]
*  It's been a strategy of complete destruction, huge civilian deaths, a blockade, which many viewed as criminal starvation, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3370.76s)]
*  consistent bombardment, and now people like the finance minister Smodrich brazenly talking openly about cleansing Gaza of all Palestinians, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3380.76s)]
*  which many would see as illegal ethnic cleansing. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3392.76s)]
*  Do you believe that Israel's government is now perpetrating war crimes in Gaza? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3396.76s)]
*  I hope and believe it doesn't perpetrate a kind of crimes against whatever, military war crimes and so on. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3404.76s)]
*  I hope that's the case. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3418.76s)]
*  Only a detailed investigation will find it, but I want to clarify the situation. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3419.76s)]
*  October 7th created a compelling imperative for Israel to make sure that Hamas will never reign over the Gaza Strip and being capable of threatening Israel from there. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3425.76s)]
*  And the war is the result of it, but having said that, the real challenge was to understand how to do it. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3437.76s)]
*  There is a compelling imperative on how to implement it. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3447.76s)]
*  And here it says somehow it turned more complicated because Netanyahu ignored the very four maxims that were the foundation for our security perspective from day one, from Ben Gurion. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3450.76s)]
*  If we have to have a war, have it very short on the enemy's territory, to a very aggressive and in order to end it as close as possible to beginning when the international legitimacy is still with us, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3467.76s)]
*  always do it with a superpower on your side and never lose grip of the moral high ground. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3488.76s)]
*  We are not a superpower. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3495.76s)]
*  We are a tiny country, isolated, a tough neighborhood. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3497.76s)]
*  It's not the Scandinavians who probably had to prefer to be born in Scandinavia, but they were there, they're our homeland. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3501.76s)]
*  So we have to be attentive to all these elements. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3507.76s)]
*  Netanyahu in Gaza seemed to forget all these elements and ignore the basic reality that the only way to defeat Hamas and reach this operation is by replacing Hamas by another legitimate power, legitimate in the eyes of international law, international communities, the neighboring peaceful or Abrahamic or the countries and even the Palestinians themselves. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3512.76s)]
*  So it cannot be a Swedish or British entity. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3540.76s)]
*  It should be a Palestinian entity. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3544.76s)]
*  So the plan wasn't the table from day one. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3547.76s)]
*  President Biden even wrote it in an article to the Russian proposal where he felt that he is failing to convince Netanyahu. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3551.76s)]
*  It means calling upon a inter-Arab force to enter into Gaza, backed by majority resolution of the Arab League. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3558.76s)]
*  And if necessary, also UN Security Council resolution creating a fine finance will come from the UAE and Saudi Arabia. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3567.76s)]
*  It needs a lot of money. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3577.76s)]
*  A government of technocrats will be established, a bureaucracy of Palestinians being built. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3580.76s)]
*  It needs some 50,000 people to run 2.2 million. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3589.76s)]
*  And gradually a new security force will be built with the training of the inter-Arab force, which will be Egyptian, Jordanian, Emirati, and under American supervision. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3593.76s)]
*  The only two conditions that Israel should put, number one, not a single individual who was a part of the army branch and branch of Hamas, not just the fighter or the launchers of rockets, the guy in the lab or the spokesman, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3606.76s)]
*  not a single individual who was part of it or part of the massacre of October 7 can be a member of any organs of this new entity. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3623.76s)]
*  Number two, the Israeli military will pull out at first to the perimeter, about half a mile, let's say, all along the strip and will not pull fully to the border before pre-agreed set of milestones toward the secure and stable situation had been achieved. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3633.76s)]
*  That was the plan. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3652.76s)]
*  It was very easy a year and a half ago because it would appear as saving Gaza from terrible destruction. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3654.76s)]
*  It's much more sensitive right now because now it might appear as saving Israel from sinking in the mud in Gaza. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3663.76s)]
*  So it's more complicated. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3670.76s)]
*  But my observation is that Netanyahu now, based on the achievements in Iran, should immediately turn to Trump and say, let's activate this solution now. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3672.76s)]
*  Immediately bring all the hostages, launch this resolution and activation, and let us join the trans vision of a new Middle East normalization with Saudi Arabia, even participating in a trade corridor from India to the Gulf, to Israel, to Europe. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3683.76s)]
*  And this is a great opportunity. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3699.76s)]
*  A question which casts some shadow about the consideration of our government in regard to Iran is that according to Netanyahu himself, it started to plan this operation immediately after the results. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3701.76s)]
*  After the results with Hezbollah, as you mentioned, the UN, the Syrian situation made it an opportunity to act. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3715.76s)]
*  But to think that our cabinet shut down in November and later on he said the date was in April and for some reason delayed to mid-June. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3724.76s)]
*  So it was all along all these matches and it didn't come to their mind that before you open a new war against Iran out of any other place, you don't end the war in Gaza, which is at your finger. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3734.76s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3749.76s)]
*  It's very disturbing. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3750.76s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3751.76s)]
*  I've got to leave it there. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3752.76s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3753.76s)]
*  Thank you very much, Nadeem for joining me. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3754.76s)]
*  Turning to Israel now and Amit Chait-Chickley is Minister for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism in the Netanyahu government. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3757.76s)]
*  He recently described my criticism of the suffering in Gaza as a troubling descent into overt antisemitism. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3764.76s)]
*  Well, welcome to you, Minister. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3771.76s)]
*  Where have I been antisemitic? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3773.76s)]
*  Well, I think that during the beginning of the war, you were very clear on the right of Israel to defend itself after the assault of October 7th. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3778.76s)]
*  And but since then, by the way, you choose to bring people like Candace Owens, which is a Holocaust denier on your show, to bring Dan Balzerian. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3789.76s)]
*  I think that giving the stage for conspiracy theorists, Holocaust deniers such as Owens, such as Evans, Balzerian, these kind of people to give them your platform, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3800.76s)]
*  I think you have responsibility. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3815.76s)]
*  And this is a wrong decision to give these people such a stage. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3817.76s)]
*  And therefore, I think I'm not saying that you are antisemitic necessarily. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3821.76s)]
*  Well, you did say that. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3826.76s)]
*  But I do think that these are wrong decisions. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3827.76s)]
*  You did say that. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3829.76s)]
*  No, I didn't say that. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3830.76s)]
*  I'm just curious where you think. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3831.76s)]
*  What's interesting is the allegations I'm antisemitic only began when I decided to start being more strident in my criticism of what your government is doing in Gaza. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3832.76s)]
*  You can criticize. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3844.76s)]
*  Hang on. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3845.76s)]
*  Hang on. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3846.76s)]
*  I'll finish my question, which is a criticism shared by many of Israel's allies by at least two of your former prime ministers now. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3847.76s)]
*  So I'm not alone in that criticism. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3855.76s)]
*  Many people think what you've been doing in Gaza in the last few months constitutes war crimes. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3857.76s)]
*  And we've seen from one of your colleagues, the finance minister Smodrich, that the big plan, as far as he's concerned, is not actually getting hostages banged or defeating Hamas, but clearing all Palestinians out of Gaza. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3862.76s)]
*  Now, I'm just curious why me criticizing your government for things like that and for what people like Smodrich are saying constitutes antisemitism. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3876.76s)]
*  No. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3887.76s)]
*  So let me be very accurate. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3888.76s)]
*  As I mentioned before, I never said that you are antisemitic. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3891.76s)]
*  No, you did. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3896.76s)]
*  I did say that. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3897.76s)]
*  You did. You implied it. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3898.76s)]
*  And I was immediately bombarded on X and other social media platforms with, I can tell you, thousands of people calling me antisemitic and a Jew hater because you, you decided to fuel that sentiment. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3899.76s)]
*  Well, you did. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3912.76s)]
*  Look, whether you are or you're not, that's, you know, that's, you know, whether I am, what have I ever been antisemitic? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3914.76s)]
*  Look, I think. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3922.76s)]
*  Why don't you tell me, when have I been antisemitic? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3923.76s)]
*  As you know, I've had people on from both sides of this war for the entire time, many of whom have expressed very controversial views. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3926.76s)]
*  And when they have, be it Candice Owens, Dan Bilzerian, people on the pro-Palestinian side, people on the pro-Israeli side, on the more extremist side, I've held them all to account. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3935.76s)]
*  I've questioned every time I've heard something I don't like. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3945.76s)]
*  What I want to know from you is why do you think as an Israeli minister you can fuel people on social media viewing me as an antisemitic person or somebody who hates Jews? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3949.76s)]
*  I'm really curious about that. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3960.76s)]
*  OK, let's. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3962.76s)]
*  Because I dare to criticise what the Israeli government is now doing in Gaza. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3963.76s)]
*  I think there is no problem. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3967.76s)]
*  There is no problem with criticising the government of Israel. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3969.76s)]
*  There is no problem with criticising what's happening in Gaza. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3973.76s)]
*  You can criticise whenever you want. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3977.76s)]
*  But the fact is that your platform became recently the main platform for Holocaust deniers. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3980.76s)]
*  Absolute nonsense. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3988.76s)]
*  Dan Bilzerian is a Holocaust denier. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3989.76s)]
*  That just means you've never watched it. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3992.76s)]
*  Candice Owens, this week she said that Mengele never made these horrific experiments in Auschwitz, spreading conspiracy theories. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=3994.76s)]
*  So I think you have responsibility and you can be much more fair and to bring much more... [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4008.76s)]
*  You don't think I've been fair to Israel? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4016.76s)]
*  To discuss these issues. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4019.76s)]
*  Just to be clear, you don't think I've been fair to Israel since this war started? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4021.76s)]
*  Look, I said at the beginning I thought you were fair. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4027.76s)]
*  Regarding Iran, I thought you were fair. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4032.76s)]
*  When you agreed with me. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4034.76s)]
*  Let's take an example, your tweet about the hospitals, OK? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4036.76s)]
*  You shared the Fox News man who said that we need to protect hospitals in Gaza and in Israel after a ballistic missile from Iran landed at the heart of hospitals. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4041.76s)]
*  OK, so I'm saying you never mentioned that these hospitals in Gaza... [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4055.76s)]
*  Let me give you some examples. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4064.76s)]
*  Shifa hospitals were the main headquarters of Hamas. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4067.76s)]
*  How many of the hospitals that you've destroyed were Hamas-run? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4071.76s)]
*  How many? Give me a number. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4075.76s)]
*  I'm giving you a few examples. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4077.76s)]
*  No, don't give me a few. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4079.76s)]
*  Because more than half of all the hospitals in Gaza have been destroyed. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4081.76s)]
*  Many others are almost irreparably damaged. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4084.76s)]
*  How many of those, in your estimation... [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4087.76s)]
*  In order that we can have a fair interview, you need to... [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4090.76s)]
*  How many of those were Hamas-run? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4093.76s)]
*  Give me a number. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4095.76s)]
*  I'm giving you a number and I'm giving you a few examples. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4097.76s)]
*  Shifa hospital, which is the main hospital, by the way, is still functioning despite the fact that it was a terror base. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4101.76s)]
*  And when we raided the hospitals, 200 terrorists were arrested in Shifa hospital. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4108.76s)]
*  In Kamel Aduan hospitals in Jebaliah, 240 terrorists were arrested in the hospitals. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4114.76s)]
*  So they're all terrorist camps. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4121.76s)]
*  Just to be clear, are they all terrorist camps? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4123.76s)]
*  Most of the hospitals in North and Gaza... [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4128.76s)]
*  So all the hospitals in Gaza are terrorist camps. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4131.76s)]
*  Where do people go to get treated? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4134.76s)]
*  If they're all terrorist camps, where do they get treated? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4136.76s)]
*  They were used by Hamas. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4139.76s)]
*  Israel didn't try to destroy the hospitals. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4142.76s)]
*  On the contrary, she sent troops, infantry, to raid these hospitals. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4146.76s)]
*  So how do half of the hospitals get destroyed? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4151.76s)]
*  During the clashes with the terrorists, obviously, and also with the European hospitals, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4153.76s)]
*  we needed to close the entrance to the bunker of Muhammad Sinawar, the head of Hamas, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4162.76s)]
*  who was hiding beneath the hospital. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4169.76s)]
*  How can I believe you? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4171.76s)]
*  Hang on, Minister. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4173.76s)]
*  You're doing what many of the ministers have been doing in recent months. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4175.76s)]
*  You basically cast doubt over everything which reflects negatively on the Israeli government war strategy, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4180.76s)]
*  to which I say there is one very simple way that you can get independent verification of all the things you're saying, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4187.76s)]
*  that all the hospitals were Hamas terror camps, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4194.76s)]
*  that every story you read is IDF making mistakes, killing people when they shouldn't have done, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4198.76s)]
*  and the rest of it. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4205.76s)]
*  All of that, apparently, these are all just terrible mistakes. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4206.76s)]
*  Why don't you let the international journalists from the outside come in and do their jobs? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4209.76s)]
*  Then they can verify everything you're saying. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4215.76s)]
*  There's a reason that the Israeli government continues to refuse to let journalists into Gaza. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4218.76s)]
*  It's not for their safety. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4224.76s)]
*  You don't care about the safety of journalists because nearly 200 Palestinian journalists have been killed. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4226.76s)]
*  I know what you're going to say. They're all Hamas. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4231.76s)]
*  OK, that's fine. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4233.76s)]
*  Another of the claims that can't be verified because you won't let independent journalists into verify. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4235.76s)]
*  Unfortunately, many of these journalists were Hamas activists. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4241.76s)]
*  How many? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4247.76s)]
*  Also, proudly, many of them, dozens. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4249.76s)]
*  How many? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4252.76s)]
*  Dozens of them. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4253.76s)]
*  So out of the nearly 200, how many were Hamas? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4254.76s)]
*  Dozens were part of Hamas. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4256.76s)]
*  Dozens of them were part of Hamas. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4258.76s)]
*  Many of them were Hamas. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4260.76s)]
*  You see what you're doing again. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4262.76s)]
*  Abdallah El-Jabal, Ismail Ego, these people came. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4264.76s)]
*  All the hospitals are Hamas, all the journalists are Hamas, everything's Hamas. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4267.76s)]
*  Every death that happens is Hamas' fault. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4272.76s)]
*  Every child that's starved is Hamas' fault. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4275.76s)]
*  Everyone who is shot in the queues for food that we've seen in the last few weeks, which is shocking to observe, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4278.76s)]
*  every one of those is Hamas' fault. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4284.76s)]
*  Everything is Hamas' fault. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4286.76s)]
*  The IDF does nothing wrong. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4288.76s)]
*  The Israeli government does nothing wrong. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4290.76s)]
*  And there's a reason you can say all this. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4292.76s)]
*  There's a reason you can sit back and say all this. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4294.76s)]
*  You don't let journalists in to do their jobs to verify what you're saying. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4297.76s)]
*  So you can say what the hell you like and we all just have to accept it. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4301.76s)]
*  You see the problem? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4307.76s)]
*  Is that a conversation or are you just giving a speech? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4308.76s)]
*  No, it's a statement. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4311.76s)]
*  Let the journalists in to do their job. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4312.76s)]
*  The longer you don't, the more I don't believe you. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4314.76s)]
*  135 journalists went into Gaza from 80 different press organizations. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4320.76s)]
*  So it's not true that journalists were not allowed to... [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4328.76s)]
*  They're all attached with the IDF, right? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4330.76s)]
*  They're embedded with the IDF. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4331.76s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4332.76s)]
*  Obviously, you don't want them to go free and be attacked by bombardment. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4333.76s)]
*  Yeah, we are in charge of their safety. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4340.76s)]
*  Let me just end by asking you one more time. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4343.76s)]
*  Can you think of any anti-Semitic thing that I've ever said? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4345.76s)]
*  I'm saying again... [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4351.76s)]
*  No, no, answer my question. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4352.76s)]
*  Answer my question. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4354.76s)]
*  If you want to pour... [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4355.76s)]
*  If you want to pour, as you did, if you want to pour hatred onto my head [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4357.76s)]
*  for being anti-Semitic, you've got to prove it. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4361.76s)]
*  It seems that you are very concerned from this tweet. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4363.76s)]
*  I thought we were going to speak about Iran. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4366.76s)]
*  I thought we were going to speak about more general issues than just about you. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4368.76s)]
*  I'm sure you did. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4371.76s)]
*  I'd rather talk about you calling me anti-Semitic. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4372.76s)]
*  I said again, your choice to bring a stage with your millions of viewers [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4378.76s)]
*  to Holocaust deniers and conspiracy theorists such as Dan Balzeri... [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4385.76s)]
*  Who I challenge for being Holocaust deniers. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4389.76s)]
*  Candace Owens. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4391.76s)]
*  Who I challenge for their views. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4392.76s)]
*  As I challenge people on the Israeli side when they say outrageous things. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4394.76s)]
*  You do not interrupt them. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4398.76s)]
*  You treat them respectfully. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4400.76s)]
*  What a load of crap. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4401.76s)]
*  You never watch my show, do you? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4402.76s)]
*  You don't think I've ever interrupted pro-Palestinian guests? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4404.76s)]
*  Like Natasha Hausdorff, amazing Natasha Hausdorff. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4407.76s)]
*  You are treating her as a bully. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4411.76s)]
*  You're treating her as a bully. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4413.76s)]
*  Really? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4415.76s)]
*  Arresting her later on in parties. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4416.76s)]
*  This is very embarrassing. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4418.76s)]
*  Am I bullying you then? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4419.76s)]
*  Am I bullying you now? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4420.76s)]
*  By the way, your decision to block everyone who criticises you... [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4421.76s)]
*  You think I harassed her at a party? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4423.76s)]
*  Is that what you just said? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4424.76s)]
*  Is that what you just said? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4425.76s)]
*  You went and said she wouldn't talk to me so... [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4427.76s)]
*  You think I harassed her at a party? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4431.76s)]
*  Wow. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4433.76s)]
*  I'm saying once again, you are blocking. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4434.76s)]
*  Wow, that's quite a claim. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4436.76s)]
*  You were there, were you? [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4437.76s)]
*  You are blocking. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4438.76s)]
*  Were you there for that? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4439.76s)]
*  Did you watch it? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4440.76s)]
*  You said she wouldn't talk to you. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4441.76s)]
*  Did you see what happened? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4443.76s)]
*  You were mocking her on Twitter. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4444.76s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't harass anybody. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4445.76s)]
*  Did you mock her on Twitter? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4446.76s)]
*  I didn't harass anybody. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4447.76s)]
*  Because she didn't talk to you? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4448.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4449.76s)]
*  And by the way, I've interrupted you as much as I've interrupted her. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4450.76s)]
*  So am I bullying you, Minister? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4453.76s)]
*  Look, I'm talking about bullying. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4455.76s)]
*  Am I bullying you? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4458.76s)]
*  I'm a warrior. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4459.76s)]
*  Am I bullying you? [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4460.76s)]
*  Look... [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4461.76s)]
*  Am I bullying you? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4462.76s)]
*  Yes or no? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4463.76s)]
*  It's very hard to talk with you. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4464.76s)]
*  Am I bullying you? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4465.76s)]
*  You are. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4467.76s)]
*  I said you are a bully. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4468.76s)]
*  Oh, you're being bullied? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4469.76s)]
*  At the moment. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4471.76s)]
*  Oh, you poor thing. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4472.76s)]
*  I hope you're OK. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4473.76s)]
*  It's very hard to speak. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4474.76s)]
*  You know what? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4475.76s)]
*  I'll let you go. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4476.76s)]
*  I'm so sorry for your hurt feelings. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4477.76s)]
*  I hope you're OK. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4479.76s)]
*  It's amazing how easily bullied you all are. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4480.76s)]
*  I'm feeling excellent. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4482.76s)]
*  When you're asked difficult questions, you all play the victim card. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4483.76s)]
*  You all start saying, I'm bullying you. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4487.76s)]
*  No, I'm not playing the victim. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4489.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4490.76s)]
*  But you didn't do that. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4491.76s)]
*  Listen to yourself. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4492.76s)]
*  When I went after people that wouldn't condemn Hamas, you all cheered me on, didn't you? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4493.76s)]
*  That wasn't bullying. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4497.76s)]
*  When I was interrupting them and going after them... [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4498.76s)]
*  I thought based on your comments... [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4501.76s)]
*  ...that you thought was great interrogating journalism. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4503.76s)]
*  But the moment I come after you guys... [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4505.76s)]
*  You let me know when I can speak. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4507.76s)]
*  ...and criticizing for indefensible actions you're now doing in Gaza, suddenly I'm a bully. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4508.76s)]
*  You see how pathetic that sounds? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4513.76s)]
*  You finished? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4520.76s)]
*  Yeah. You? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4521.76s)]
*  I wasn't... [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4525.76s)]
*  It's very hard to speak. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4527.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4528.76s)]
*  You know what makes me laugh? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4529.76s)]
*  Because I thought... [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4530.76s)]
*  You inspire thousands of people... [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4531.76s)]
*  Can I say something? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4533.76s)]
*  You inspire thousands of people on social media... [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4534.76s)]
*  Can I say something? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4536.76s)]
*  ...to call me a Jew-hating anti-Semite. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4537.76s)]
*  Can I say something? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4539.76s)]
*  And you have the brass neck to say I'm bullying you. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4540.76s)]
*  Honestly. Grow a pair. It's pathetic. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4543.76s)]
*  Have you listened to this interview? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4547.76s)]
*  Have I? I've conducted it. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4549.76s)]
*  Yeah. Look, it's very hard to talk. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4553.76s)]
*  Not really. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4555.76s)]
*  You just have to justify why you call me anti-Semitic. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4556.76s)]
*  You failed to do so because I've never been anti-Semitic. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4558.76s)]
*  Look, I... [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4561.76s)]
*  I do take it personally. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4562.76s)]
*  I'm quite stunned by the fact that we are running an entire interview [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4563.76s)]
*  speaking about you and your self-esteem [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4568.76s)]
*  and your inability to take any criticism. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4572.76s)]
*  Any criticism. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4577.76s)]
*  Oh, wow. Says the guy... [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4578.76s)]
*  Says the guy that planned my criticism. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4580.76s)]
*  And let's go back to my tweet, Pierce. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4582.76s)]
*  Let's go back... [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4584.76s)]
*  Pierce, let's go back to my tweet. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4585.76s)]
*  During this tweet, I said that at the beginning of the war, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4588.76s)]
*  you were relatively fair, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4592.76s)]
*  but then you became the main stage worldwide of Holocaust deniers [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4594.76s)]
*  who are spreading conspiracy theories against the Jewish people [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4601.76s)]
*  and the State of Israel. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4605.76s)]
*  You've just made that up. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4606.76s)]
*  I do watch. I do watch. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4608.76s)]
*  I had one person... [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4610.76s)]
*  And when you brought people... [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4612.76s)]
*  I had one guest... [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4614.76s)]
*  And when you brought people who represent the State of Israel... [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4615.76s)]
*  Just to be clear... [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4618.76s)]
*  And when you brought people... [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4619.76s)]
*  No, no, I'm sorry. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4620.76s)]
*  You said something. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4621.76s)]
*  I'm going to count to you. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4622.76s)]
*  To be clear... [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4623.76s)]
*  You don't let them speak just like you don't letting me speak. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4624.76s)]
*  Dan Belzerian is the only guest who has even attempted [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4627.76s)]
*  to cast doubt over the Holocaust, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4631.76s)]
*  and I chewed him up like I've been doing to you. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4633.76s)]
*  So it's complete and utter nonsense what you've just said. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4636.76s)]
*  Complete nonsense. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4640.76s)]
*  And I will continue to go after people who say outrageous things [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4641.76s)]
*  which are not true, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4646.76s)]
*  whether it's Belzerian being a complete moron [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4647.76s)]
*  or whether it's you inspiring people to view me as a Jew hater, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4650.76s)]
*  because that is reprehensible. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4654.76s)]
*  And just because I'm now more critical of your government, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4656.76s)]
*  you should be looking at yourselves and wondering, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4658.76s)]
*  why are people like me now more critical of you? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4661.76s)]
*  You can use this interview to have a serious conversation [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4664.76s)]
*  regarding Iran, regarding Gaza. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4670.76s)]
*  Yeah, we could do, but you know what? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4673.76s)]
*  We were speaking about you. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4675.76s)]
*  All this interview is about you and your self-esteem [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4676.76s)]
*  and the fact that you were insulted because of the criticism. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4679.76s)]
*  When you call me anti-Semitic, I take it personally. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4683.76s)]
*  Anyway, I'm going to leave it there. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4686.76s)]
*  But you can go back to my tweet. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4687.76s)]
*  I didn't say you're anti-Semitic. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4689.76s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4690.76s)]
*  We all read what you wrote. It's fine. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4691.76s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining me. I appreciate it. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-yzKQThWM&t=4693.76s)]
