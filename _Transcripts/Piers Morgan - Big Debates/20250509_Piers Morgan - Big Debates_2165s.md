Video Description: The Met Gala is one of the most glittering events in the fashion elite's calendars - and along with the show-stopping and at times rather ridiculous outfits, there were the usual gigantic egos that could put even Piers Morgan's to shame.

Piers debates whether the event is as worthy as it makes out to be with YouTubers Nerdrotic and Critical Drinker as well as Uncensored contributors Esther Krakue and Ernest Owens, before being joined by actor Zachary Levi to discuss how President Donald Trump's film tariffs plan will affect Hollywood.

Then unfortunately our panel had to be cut short in the middle of filming because Kanye West arrived... and you probably already know what happened next. But will Ye be back in our studio soon?

# “Egos Out of CONTROL!” Piers Morgan & Kanye Update, Met Gala + Trump Hollywood Tariffs
**Piers Morgan - Big Debates:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY)
*  So it is the greatest battle, I always think, the Met Gala, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=0.0s)]
*  for attention seeking that the world has ever known. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=3.36s)]
*  There are also a bunch of hypocrites, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=6.8s)]
*  and half the audience is just there to roast them. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=8.56s)]
*  They weren't lecturing people about slavery. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=11.44s)]
*  It literally made it the theme of the event. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=13.68s)]
*  Stop being so literal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=15.36s)]
*  Who loses if they raise 30 million, right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=16.48s)]
*  I guess the four-year-old girl chained to a table, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=18.96s)]
*  making all those clothes. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=21.28s)]
*  Maybe she's the one. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Apart from the slaves. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=23.36s)]
*  The world that we live in. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=24.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=25.84s)]
*  Other nations, a lot of them, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=27.36s)]
*  have stolen our movie industry. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=29.44s)]
*  If they're not willing to make a movie inside the United States. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  Hollywood has been disintegrating for the better part of 40, 50 years. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=35.36s)]
*  We must do something about plugging the holes in this sinking ship. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=41.44s)]
*  You can circle back when you can count. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=45.04s)]
*  If you want to sit in front of me, Yeh, get on a plane, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=47.52s)]
*  come to London, come to my studio, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=50.56s)]
*  and let's do this man-to-man, face-to-face. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  New York's Met Gala is the annual pony show [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=56.4s)]
*  for tone-deaf superstars in very expensive costumes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=59.2s)]
*  who all want you to know they have a great moral purpose for being there. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  Pharrell Williams, this year's co-chair, wore 100,000 pearls. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=66.0s)]
*  The most important tribute to the world's impoverished people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=69.52s)]
*  Some of your fashion icons related to this theme. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=72.88s)]
*  You know what? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=79.12s)]
*  The working class, you know, the black men, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  you know, the black men of the working class, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=84.8s)]
*  because they did the hard work, they do the hard work, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=87.52s)]
*  but then when it's time to get fresh, they get dandy and super fine. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=90.48s)]
*  I'm inspired by the working class because that's where I come from. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=95.44s)]
*  Well, the working class may have been honoured at the gala, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=98.96s)]
*  but it's unlikely that any of them actually saw the honour, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  given that a table cost $350,000. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=104.24s)]
*  Others have more subtle methods for signalling their virtue, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  including actress Lisa from White Lotus, who wore a picture, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=110.32s)]
*  a civil rights hero Rosa Parks on her crotch. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=114.0s)]
*  Incredibly, it was Sydney Sweeney who faced accusations [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  of being particularly tone deaf to the culturally meaningful theme [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=121.84s)]
*  by taking her inspiration from white actress Kim Novak. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=125.6s)]
*  So is the met meaningful or just moronic? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=130.08s)]
*  Well, here to debate all that from the nerdotic channel Gary Beakler, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=133.36s)]
*  YouTube's premier movie reviewer, if you don't believe him, ask him yourself, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=136.72s)]
*  the critical drinker, aka Will John, uncensored contributor Esther Krakow, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=140.96s)]
*  and the author of the case for council culture, Ernest Owens. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=145.04s)]
*  OK, Esther, every year this comes round, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=149.36s)]
*  and I've just posted to X that there were two reasons I didn't attend this year. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=153.52s)]
*  One is I wasn't invited, which is the same every year. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=157.44s)]
*  I was going to ask. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=160.64s)]
*  Secondly, I don't think my ego is big enough, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=161.52s)]
*  and I'm not known globally for having a particularly fragile ego, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=163.6s)]
*  but the egos are out of control of this thing, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=168.0s)]
*  and the tormented, twisted way they try to make us think this is all about poor people [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=171.12s)]
*  is frankly laughable. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=177.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think when you get to a certain level of fame, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=179.52s)]
*  you kind of lose your mind a bit. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=181.6s)]
*  Now, of course, this is a fundraiser for the arts. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=182.8s)]
*  It's been going on since, I believe, 1948, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=184.56s)]
*  but it's mainly for the celebrities involved a way to get your name out there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=186.96s)]
*  They hardly even mention the designers actually that are responsible for the work, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=191.36s)]
*  many of whom actually pay for their $70,000 tickets. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=194.32s)]
*  It's usually a way for them to get body parts out there. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=197.68s)]
*  I mean, Kim Kardashian, I thought her outfit looked nice, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=200.16s)]
*  and then she turned around. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=202.48s)]
*  I was like, oh, there it is. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=203.2s)]
*  Sabrina Carpenter decided to wear no trousers whatsoever. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=204.48s)]
*  I'm pretty sure Halle Berry went without knickers at her 50-plus years of age. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=208.48s)]
*  So clearly, their motivation is not really to draw attention to the arts. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=212.56s)]
*  They're all trying to grab our attention [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=215.84s)]
*  and meet a sea of other world-class attention seekers. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=217.92s)]
*  So it is the greatest battle, I always think, the Met Gala, for attention seeking, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=222.16s)]
*  that the world has ever known. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=227.12s)]
*  And each year, it gets ever more... [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=228.96s)]
*  I thought the winner by far was Diana Ross, who just thought, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  fuck this, I'm going to wear the biggest dress ever seen in the history of dresses [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=233.44s)]
*  and wipe the floor with all of you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=237.44s)]
*  Her dress was almost bigger than the whole Ray carpet. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=238.8s)]
*  And I thought, yes, yes, that is the way to do it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=242.08s)]
*  Go big or go home. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=245.68s)]
*  No, you're right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think the thing is, the fact that many of these people actually wear [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=249.36s)]
*  as little clothes as physically possible is what I find disturbing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=253.84s)]
*  I mean, the theme was around black dandyism. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=257.44s)]
*  And if you know anything about black dandyism, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=259.6s)]
*  it's focused on tailoring really sharp lines [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=261.44s)]
*  and clean, elegant form and suits and all of that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=264.48s)]
*  You haven't got to sell a fashion icon like these. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=267.36s)]
*  Some of them literally didn't wear anything. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=269.12s)]
*  I mean, do a leaper again, her bum's out. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=271.52s)]
*  I just don't understand. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=273.36s)]
*  If you're going to be part of this fundraiser for a costume fundraising event [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=274.96s)]
*  for the costume department of the Met, why not go all out? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=280.4s)]
*  Why not praise the designers and actually say, yes, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=284.48s)]
*  I'm going to put my ego aside and my reproductive organs [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  and actually show the art on display that these people did. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=290.24s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=293.36s)]
*  Why don't we go to the resident black dandy on the panel? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  Good evening, Ernest. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=297.92s)]
*  Now, Ernest, what's your honest view about this? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=302.88s)]
*  The reason I ask is this. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=305.68s)]
*  The theme was super fine, inspired by the scholar Monica L. Miller's book, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=306.88s)]
*  Slaves to Fashion, Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=312.32s)]
*  Now, forgive me if I call them a bunch of hypocrites, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=318.32s)]
*  but let's analyse the fashion industry, shall we? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=321.12s)]
*  According to the anti-slavery organisation Unseen, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=325.12s)]
*  10% of cases reported to the modern slavery and exploitation helpline [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=328.48s)]
*  relate to businesses in the garment sector, i.e. fashion. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=332.88s)]
*  One fifth of the world's cotton comes from Xinjing in China, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=337.44s)]
*  where there's significant evidence of forced labour, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=341.92s)]
*  specifically related to cotton picking. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=344.48s)]
*  The 2023 Global Slavery Index report says that $147.9 billion worth of garments [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=347.44s)]
*  and 12.7 billion worth of textiles are at risk of being produced by forced labour [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  and are reported annually by G20 countries. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=359.44s)]
*  I mean, should they be lecturing anybody about the need to honour slavery [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=363.04s)]
*  when they're still engaged in it so aggressively? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=369.28s)]
*  I think it's, you know, first of all, I'm very impressed that you did research on slavery [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  and, you know, workforce issues and black history, Piers. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=378.96s)]
*  It's actually incredible, given, you know, in the US right now, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=382.55999999999995s)]
*  they're trying to ban those type of conversations and histories in classrooms and things. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=386.23999999999995s)]
*  So I'm really happy that your show was providing that kind of information to the public at large. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=390.0s)]
*  It's unfortunate that it's being used in such a misguided way [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=395.11999999999995s)]
*  to try to, you know, crap on a great philanthropic event that raised over $30 million for the arts [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=399.04s)]
*  at a time where arts funding is being cut in the US right now. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=407.44s)]
*  I wasn't crapping on it. I just said there are a bunch of hypocrites. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=410.88s)]
*  Well, they want to shine a light on... [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=414.56s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=416.08000000000004s)]
*  They want to shine a light on literally a theme called slaves to fashion. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  Maybe stop using slavery to promote the fashion business. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=420.16s)]
*  Well, that's your interpretation of it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=423.92s)]
*  I can make the same argument about what's happened at the Kennedy Center right now. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=426.56s)]
*  But you know there are more slaves alive right now than there was ever in the history of the universe. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=429.68s)]
*  We have more slaves now than there ever was in human history. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=437.12s)]
*  You can make a leap. So do you want to cancel the Met Gala? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=440.08s)]
*  I don't want to cancel the Met Gala. I just find ironic that they're talking... [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=443.76s)]
*  This show has been supporting slavery to fashion. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=446.88s)]
*  Maybe they might take their own advice and use slaves to produce their own fashion. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=449.68s)]
*  That's it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=453.6s)]
*  They didn't use slaves. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=455.12s)]
*  The point is you can say, look, it's a great laugh. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=456.4s)]
*  It's not rooted just in slavery. Stop it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=459.12s)]
*  You can say it's a great laugh. We can all look at the fashion, have a good old laugh or whatever, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=460.8s)]
*  have the best and worst, all that kind of stuff. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=464.24s)]
*  We can say there are a bunch of egotistical goons. Of course we can. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=466.08s)]
*  We can acknowledge the fact it raises a ton of money. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=470.48s)]
*  You would have said they were too woke if they made it about that, Pierce. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=473.04s)]
*  Hang on. I haven't finished my... [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=475.92s)]
*  There's always going to be a goal that you're going to move. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=476.96s)]
*  I haven't finished my question, Ernest. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=478.48s)]
*  You would have argued if they made it about that, you all would have argued, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=479.52s)]
*  oh, it's too woke. Woke is dead. You would have promoted your book. I get it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=482.64s)]
*  You would have been happy either way. So stop it. You're being intellectually dishonest. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=486.96s)]
*  I haven't actually finished my question, Ernest. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=490.4s)]
*  Can I finish my question? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=492.32s)]
*  I said you could make a case that the fundraising is great, right? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=494.72s)]
*  The rest of it is harmless fun. We can study what they wear, good, bad and ugly. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=498.72s)]
*  And we had all three last night. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=502.72s)]
*  But you could also say it is a bit hypocritical of an industry that is clearly, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=504.32s)]
*  according to all the official bodies, is not in the best place to be lecturing people [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=509.6s)]
*  about slavery and why we should be paying more attention to it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=515.12s)]
*  But they weren't lecturing people about slavery. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=518.24s)]
*  It literally made it the theme of the event. Stop being so literal. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=520.48s)]
*  It made it the theme of the event. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=523.28s)]
*  The theme of the event was to highlight the designers. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=524.16s)]
*  Again, if you're going to ask somebody who's really actually into black dandyism, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=527.6s)]
*  into fashion, that type of way, what I'm telling you is that it was a celebration [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=530.64s)]
*  of that culture and those designers, which is why they participated in it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=534.96s)]
*  It's funny that you're thinking for that crowd, even though they were the ones [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  that were benefiting and participating and highlighting it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=542.08s)]
*  And if they would have done it a different way, you would have argued, oh my goodness, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=545.04s)]
*  they're being so woke. They're sucking out the fun of fashion, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  lighting up and they're doing that. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=552.08s)]
*  And you want them to do a history lecture on slavery during a philanthropic event? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=553.52s)]
*  What double standards? You don't do that for any other groups. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  Do you actually ask other like not the only reason why you're attacking them [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=560.64s)]
*  is because they're liberal, because you think they're progressive. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=564.0s)]
*  And now you're mad that woke people are having joy and not trying to shove slavery down people's [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=567.12s)]
*  throat. Which one is it, Pierce? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=570.4s)]
*  I think there's just a bunch of hypocrites. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=571.68s)]
*  Because if they would have went that direction, you would have said [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  that they're sucking the fun out of it. They've done China through the lighting glass. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=575.12s)]
*  Take your win. You've had a good monologue. Let's just cut it there, right? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=580.08s)]
*  I want to ask Negrotic. This is a clip of Andre 3000. Full disclosure, I've never heard of him, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  but he turned up with a piano on his head. Let's have a look. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=591.04s)]
*  I need to know everything about this look. It's just a piano. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=593.2s)]
*  It's just a piano. Yeah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  But it's like, is it a real like this is what I'm like, could you play that piano right now? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=599.76s)]
*  Yes, I could. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=604.6400000000001s)]
*  Fully functioning? Yes. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=605.44s)]
*  And is it heavy? No. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=606.88s)]
*  Is this sort of like, you know, maybe a sense of costuming tonight? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=608.4000000000001s)]
*  Wow. You both look amazing. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=613.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=616.24s)]
*  You both look amazing. What world are we living in? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=620.24s)]
*  Critical Drinker, where's your piano, man? For God's sake. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=623.28s)]
*  I want a piano that I can wear. This is insane in all the best ways, man. It's just the absurdity [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=626.4s)]
*  of modern celebrity culture just distilled down into one video. I love it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=632.08s)]
*  So that's really interesting. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=637.28s)]
*  Zoolander has become reality now. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=638.16s)]
*  Well, that's the thing, Negrotic, though. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  It's Zoolander and Hunger Games. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=641.04s)]
*  Yeah, but Negrotic, isn't the truth there, what Critical Drinker just said, is that [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=642.48s)]
*  in a way, it just adds to the gaiety of the world, right? Once a year, we get a good old [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=648.32s)]
*  laugh at these people dressing up like, often, idiots. But it's something to talk about. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=652.64s)]
*  It lightens the load of the day's otherwise very, at the moment, serious consequential news. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  Oh, do we take it too seriously? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=664.96s)]
*  Tax Day has passed, but for millions of Americans, that's where the trouble begins. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=667.84s)]
*  The IRS is now ramping up enforcement for those who missed the April deadline [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=671.6s)]
*  or still owe back taxes. Well, today's sponsor, Tax Network USA, can still help. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=676.08s)]
*  If your books are a mess, if you're self-employed, or if you're a business owner, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=682.24s)]
*  Tax Network USA specializes in cleaning up financial chaos and getting you back on track quickly. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=686.64s)]
*  They say the IRS is applying enforcement pressure at levels they've never seen before. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=693.2s)]
*  But even after the deadline, it's not too late to take control. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=698.0s)]
*  The consultation is completely free. Acting now could stop penalties, threatening letters, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=702.24s)]
*  and surprise levies before they escalate. Call 1-800-958-1000 or visit tnusa.com [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=707.92s)]
*  slash peers. That's tnusa.com slash peers. Let Tax Network USA make the next move, not the IRS. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=717.04s)]
*  Yes. Should we not just have it for what it is, a bunch of narcissistic celebrities showing off, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=726.96s)]
*  waiting to be judged by our critical eyes, but at the same time raising $30 million? Who loses? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=734.08s)]
*  Exactly. They're raising money. If the charity is legit, that's fine. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=741.2s)]
*  They do what the officers are not raising money. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=744.24s)]
*  Ernest, Ernest, your name is not Negeotic last time I checked. I can't think of two people [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=745.9200000000001s)]
*  less like each other, so let Negeotic have his say, please. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=751.44s)]
*  I again, I see it as Zoolander and parody, but like the more comic stuff is fun. I think that's [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=754.96s)]
*  fine. And if you're raising money for a legitimate charity, that's fine. There are also a bunch of [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=762.72s)]
*  hypocrites and that's half the audience is just there to roast them. I know some people are into [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=767.6s)]
*  this. Obviously, I'm an expert in fashion, but I understand that like as much as Africa, but I [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=772.48s)]
*  understand that it's an art form. It's an art form I'm completely not into, kind of like musicals. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=778.8s)]
*  And I can see the artistic part of it. I was expecting Andre 3000 and Janelle [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=784.16s)]
*  Monet to do this because that's actually their style. Who is he by the way? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=789.3599999999999s)]
*  So he's a musician. He's a very famous artist. You know, so hey, that was him. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  And he and Janelle Monet actually are very dandy in their style. Generally, that's how we've always [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=796.7199999999999s)]
*  known. He's always worn suits in his music videos. Janelle Monet has always kind of had this kind of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  androgynous style to her and very tailored, very fitted and all of that. So actually, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=806.0s)]
*  if anyone was expecting people to do this, it was those two. It's the others that I'm utterly baffled [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=810.16s)]
*  by. And they could have just been on theme, on brand and you know, gone about their day, but they [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=816.08s)]
*  decided to take their kid off. I mean, Halle Berry wasn't wearing knickers, which still traumatizes. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=821.36s)]
*  All right, well, I'll tell you what, critical trigger. The thing that struck me was it depends [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=824.88s)]
*  what they say actually. If they just glide up the carpet looking pretty or dumb or whatever [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=830.08s)]
*  and show off their dress, great, right? Then that's fine. It's when they try and do what Louis, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=834.8s)]
*  and I like Louis Hamilton, but one of the else he's an arsehole fan like me. So I'll always [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=838.8s)]
*  forgive anything. And he's a brilliant racing driver. But when he said this about his outfit, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=843.04s)]
*  look, I've got a view. I'm just in love with this look right now. I'm taking it all in. Yeah. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=847.76s)]
*  This is Grace Wells Bono. Oh, okay. Grace. We've gone into great detail. The shells represent [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=853.12s)]
*  currency. Ivory represents purity. Grace is very, very much in spirituality. And we really [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=858.56s)]
*  wanted to pay homage to our culture of Africa. Louis, man, come on. I mean, the last time I saw [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=864.8s)]
*  somebody wearing an outfit like that was a gondolier in Venice. Yeah. Is he in danger [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=870.0s)]
*  of taking himself a little too seriously? Yeah. I mean, he certainly had a justification for the [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=876.0799999999999s)]
*  suit that he was wearing. So good on him, I guess. Like, I didn't really get that much from it, but [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=881.5999999999999s)]
*  it just looks like a white suit. But yeah, if it makes him happy, then fine. Yeah, I don't really [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=885.76s)]
*  know what I can draw from that one. At least he's not wearing curtains like last year, which was [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=891.68s)]
*  not acceptable. Well, the other one, somebody came literally in a box when they left the Carlisle [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=895.4399999999999s)]
*  Hotel. Let's take a look at the footage here. They wanted to keep their looks so secret. They [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=902.4s)]
*  were actually in a box leaving the Carlisle. I don't even know who that is. It was probably [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  a distinct improvement, actually, on whatever came out of the box. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=916.4s)]
*  It's probably Pedro Pascal on his way to his next acting gig. Yeah. Exactly. I was going to say [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=920.8s)]
*  Kanye, but... Well, look, we're going to switch gears. The main guy, you know what, Ernest, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=926.16s)]
*  you've slightly persuaded me. There is a danger of over-flogging an event that raises $30 million. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=931.52s)]
*  In the end, it always gives you something to talk about. The fashion is a good old laugh. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=940.64s)]
*  Some of it's great, actually. Some of it's awful. But I kind of take your point. It's like, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=944.72s)]
*  who loses if they raise $30 million, right? I guess the four-year-old girl chained to a table, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=950.4s)]
*  making all those clothes. Maybe she's the one. Apart from the slaves. That's the problem. But [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=955.12s)]
*  to be fair, if you look at the Grammys and you look at the Oscars, they do the same thing at the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=959.84s)]
*  Oscars, the Grammys, these award shows. And you all will say, which has more fair critique, that [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=964.88s)]
*  they're self-celebrating themselves and for what and for nothing. They're literally doing a red [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=969.92s)]
*  carpet, wearing the same crazy fashions, but they're raising millions of dollars for good. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=974.64s)]
*  So at the end of the day, it's like whether you wear a regular suit or a piano or you take yourself [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=980.64s)]
*  too seriously, at least they're doing it for good. You know what, Ernest? This has very rarely happened. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=985.28s)]
*  Yeah, come on. Ernest, in our entire working relationship, I can't ever remember saying these [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=990.16s)]
*  words before, but you've kind of changed my mind, Ernest. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=994.32s)]
*  It finally happened. Someone clip that. This is history right here. I didn't realise it was that much. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=999.5200000000001s)]
*  You've kind of persuaded me, so we're moving on. We're moving on with me taking a rare loss. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1006.5600000000001s)]
*  Ernest, ecstatic. Mr. Woke has finally got one over me. No, I think that's quite a persuasive [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1010.6400000000001s)]
*  argument, so let's move on to something quite interesting. Joining us now is the US actor Zachary [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1016.8000000000001s)]
*  Levi, one of the few Hollywood stars to endorse President Trump before the election. The reason [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1021.68s)]
*  we got you on, Zachary, is this whole thing that Trump's unleashed, obviously, global tariff war, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1026.24s)]
*  we know about, but now he's announced 100% tariffs on all films made outside Hollywood. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1031.6799999999998s)]
*  Let's see what he said. Other nations, a lot of them, have stolen our movie industry, and I'm saying [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1037.76s)]
*  if they're not willing to make a movie inside the United States, then we should have a tariff on [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1043.76s)]
*  movies that come in. And not only that, governments are actually giving big money, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1049.52s)]
*  I mean, they're supporting them financially. So that's sort of a threat to our country, in a sense. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1054.0s)]
*  Now, it seems to me, Zachary, that rather like the global tariff war that he unleashed, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1059.12s)]
*  A, it's all negotiable, so I think everything with Trump is always a negotiation. He's really [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1064.08s)]
*  chucking everything at the wall and seeing what lands successfully, and also what kind of deals [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1068.8s)]
*  can be done. But I do think his overarching theme for all the tariff stuff is his genuine belief [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1073.52s)]
*  because I've interviewed him many times over the last 20 years. He's always had a belief that [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1079.44s)]
*  America has been ripped off and been outsourcing way too much stuff out of the United States, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1085.76s)]
*  and that that's why American manufacturing is in the doldrums, and he wants to bring it back, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1091.8400000000001s)]
*  and he thinks the best way to do that is through the mechanism of tough tariffs. I do get it. I'm [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1097.1200000000001s)]
*  not sure if it's going to work quite the way he hopes, but I do get why he's doing this. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1102.48s)]
*  I don't know enough about the Hollywood industry in relation to this, but I think you know a bit [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1107.68s)]
*  more. Tell me about the reality. I mean, how much work has basically been outsourced out of [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1112.64s)]
*  Hollywood and the US in terms of the production of movies? I agree that it's a very interesting [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1119.04s)]
*  game, right? And I think a lot of it is and has been him throwing out these kind of warning shots [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1125.3600000000001s)]
*  across the bow, like, hey, we're going to do this if you don't come to the table and play ball. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1130.88s)]
*  And I do believe, I hope, that it will be effective, and I think it's already been [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1134.56s)]
*  effective in some ways. Hollywood is a different type of a game in that it's always been an [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1139.44s)]
*  international community. Film is not exclusively American. The technology that makes film is not [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1143.76s)]
*  exclusively American. I don't believe that other countries are somehow taking American [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1148.8799999999999s)]
*  film technologies and going and exploiting them elsewhere. That said, every industry is essentially, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1154.8799999999999s)]
*  it values profit over people, and it's been doing this for far too long, and Hollywood is no [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1163.4399999999998s)]
*  exception. And so starting in the early 80s, that's when we really started seeing this exodus [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1167.04s)]
*  of productions. It started greatly in Canada in the early 80s. Television shows like 21 Jump [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1172.32s)]
*  Street were going to Vancouver because the Canadian dollar was, it was a softer dollar, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1178.08s)]
*  and the American dollar could go a lot further. That led to Canada then implementing more tax [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1183.36s)]
*  filming incentives that attracted more business up there than other countries started doing the [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1188.6399999999999s)]
*  same, and many states within the United States started doing the same. And so the community that [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1192.72s)]
*  was Hollywood, Los Angeles, Hollywood, has been disintegrating for the better part of 40, 50 years. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1196.96s)]
*  And so now we have record low employment in Los Angeles and also elsewhere in the United States [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1205.92s)]
*  because, to your point and to what you've been talking about, you can go to Spain now and get [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1212.16s)]
*  50 cents back on the dollar. You can go to Eastern Europe. I shot a movie out in the Republic of [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1216.48s)]
*  Georgia last fall, and we shot there specifically because, in large part because the incentives and [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1221.44s)]
*  the price of production was significantly lower. I don't want to penalize the international [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1230.0s)]
*  community. I think that art itself transcends borders, right? We shouldn't be looking at this [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1236.16s)]
*  as if there's American art and then there's international art. Art is art. Entertainment is [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1241.28s)]
*  entertainment. And I think that, and I've been very blessed to shoot both a lot in the United [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1245.68s)]
*  States and outside of the United States, and I don't think that we should just wholesale, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1250.32s)]
*  you know, say, no, we shouldn't be shooting anything over there. However, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1256.0s)]
*  we must do something about plugging the holes in this sinking ship. If you're struggling with [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1260.08s)]
*  sleepless nights and exhausting days, you might want to try Beams Dream Powder. Beams is proudly [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1264.96s)]
*  founded in America and run by people who value hard work, integrity, and delivering results. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1270.48s)]
*  It's a healthy nighttime blend packed with science-backed ingredients to improve your sleep, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1276.1599999999999s)]

*  natural ingredients, reishi, apigenin, l-theanine, melatonin, and magnesium. It's designed to help [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1286.0s)]

*  Sleep better, wake up stronger, and show up ready for your family, your work, and your country too. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1315.76s)]
*  I have many, many, many friends. Actors, crew, they aren't working. They're simply not working. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1323.1200000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of that has to do with we have a massive contraction going on in Hollywood right [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1329.68s)]
*  now. Pre-pandemic, we were making more content than had ever been made before. Then we had the [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1333.68s)]
*  pandemic. Then we had multiple strikes. All the studios are kind of circling their wagons and [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1338.56s)]
*  being like, well, we don't want to be losing more money. How do we do this? I will say that I think [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1342.96s)]
*  the tactic should be less about how do we penalize people going abroad and making movies, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1350.16s)]
*  and more to the point he was making toward the end of that video clip. How do you incentivize [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1357.12s)]
*  homegrown American-made content? That to me is the more effective way of doing this. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1362.6399999999999s)]
*  But I will also say on top of all of this, I fear that all of this is going to be moot because in [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1369.28s)]
*  two to five years, AI is going to be replacing everything, not just my industry, but jobs across [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1376.2399999999998s)]
*  all industries. I think what I would love for the president to really be looking into is not simply [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1383.52s)]
*  incentivizing how to get more American jobs, but how to hold onto more human jobs. We could bring [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1389.12s)]
*  those jobs back to America, but if we don't protect against AI companies, allowing basically anyone [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1398.72s)]
*  to just sit at home and without really any talent or skill or time to learn any of those things, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1404.48s)]
*  but with a few creative ideas and a few keystrokes to just say, I want a movie that looks and feels [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1412.16s)]
*  and sounds like this, enter, and for a one-of-one to be propagated right in front of their faces [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1417.0400000000002s)]
*  of any movie they could possibly want, any television show, any video game, any music, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1423.2s)]
*  any anything. A lot of people will push back on me. They say, well, of course, that'll be possible, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1426.96s)]
*  but most people are still going to want really human art. I push back to them and I say, you [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1431.52s)]
*  won't be able to tell the difference. It will be so good. It will be indiscernible. I think that, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1436.96s)]
*  yes, we need to figure out ways of bringing jobs back to the United States. I don't think that that [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1441.76s)]
*  is done through specifically penalizing outside work, but rather incentivizing internal work and [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1447.12s)]
*  also protecting human effort. Really interesting. Zachary, thank you very much. You presented that [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1455.6s)]
*  perfectly. I appreciate you coming on Sensor. Thank you very much. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1460.64s)]
*  I'm about to step in this interview, but I can hop back on and about whenever it's done. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1472.24s)]
*  You're not going to take inches off my dick, bro. How many followers do I have? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1478.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, how many is it? This is what you get for now. We can circle back when you can count. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1484.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1491.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1491.36s)]
*  The genesis of all this was two years ago, I interviewed him when he was going through his [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1499.52s)]
*  initial slightly crazy phase where it appeared that he was embracing anti-Semitism in a pretty [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1503.9199999999998s)]
*  vile way. These constant tirades against Jewish people. It's a tirade. That was a tweet. Have you [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1511.9199999999998s)]
*  felt my pain yet? You haven't felt my pain. You don't want to feel my pain. You don't hold [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1519.52s)]
*  accountability. La, la, la, la, la. You don't hold accountability to my pain. You're being a Karen. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1525.12s)]
*  I took him on and it was a two hour interview. It was quite fascinating, but he was reasonably [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1531.44s)]
*  normal, I would say, for a lot of that interview. Quite reflective, quite self-aware about what he'd [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1537.2s)]
*  done and almost apologetic. Do you still love Kim? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1543.6s)]
*  I absolutely love her. I'll love her for life. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1550.6399999999999s)]
*  Two years forward and yay has been on a systematic rampage of blatant anti-Semitism, embracing [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1554.3999999999999s)]
*  Adolf Hitler, Nazism, swastikas. It's all been extraordinarily and I think deliberately offensive, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1562.8s)]
*  particularly to Jewish people, of course. It's caused him enormous upheaval. A lot of commercial [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1571.36s)]
*  deals have crashed because of his behavior, notably on X where he goes on these posting rampages. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1577.6s)]
*  It seems like he's on a mission to attack everyone and everything. Blaming everyone and everything [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1584.08s)]
*  for all his woes apart from, of course, the person who is most responsible and that's him. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1589.6799999999998s)]
*  I didn't think we'd get another interview with him because I've been lambasting him [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1595.12s)]
*  quite regularly on X, taking him to task there, but feeling like I'm howling in the wind because [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1599.84s)]
*  nothing he ever does seems to prompt any suspension from X. In fact, the only time I think he got [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1605.9199999999998s)]
*  suspended was when he posted some legal pornography, which was a line that Elon Musk's team at X felt [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1610.9599999999998s)]
*  crossed their line, but not the anti-Semitism or the very hateful rhetoric, which I think is an [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1619.52s)]
*  interesting distinction. Anyway, two days ago, I got told that Ye was prepared to be interviewed [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1624.8s)]
*  by me again for Piers Morgan on Sensor. He was in Majorca with some other rapper called Steamy or [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1631.68s)]
*  Somi or something. I can't remember his name. Never heard of him. Some weird guy. I think he [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1640.1599999999999s)]
*  wants to be Andrew Tate's horrible little stepbrother or something from his antics. He's [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1644.8s)]
*  been banned from every other platform, but he was the conduit to get to an interview with Ye again. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1649.44s)]
*  I was genuinely curious to actually hold him to account for all the vile things he's been saying. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1655.52s)]
*  Is he just a massive troll? Is he mentally unhinged or is he just a grotesque attention seeker? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1661.2s)]
*  Or is he now a genuine anti-Semitic, pro-Adolf Hitler Nazi? Or is he all of those things? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1668.64s)]
*  I think at the very least, he ought to be challenged properly in an interview format to [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1677.6000000000001s)]
*  determine what he is or isn't and to see if he has any explanation for what he's done. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1682.5600000000002s)]
*  Anyway, we were supposed to interview him on Monday night. He kept my crew in Majorca [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1688.16s)]
*  waiting for about two hours. He kept me waiting for two hours in London. He kept my crew in London [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1695.6000000000001s)]
*  waiting for two hours. All of this is expensive. Thousands of pounds and euros were being expended [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1702.64s)]
*  waiting for his greatness, as he would see it, to actually do his interview. He didn't show it. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1708.64s)]
*  At the last minute, he decided he'd rather do it the next day. I went, okay, I'll give him one more [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1716.48s)]
*  chance. Obviously, it was incredibly irritating. Obviously, my inclination was to wring him by his [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1723.0400000000002s)]
*  scrawny, arrogant neck. But no, I gave him another chance. Let's just see if he rocks up the next [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1728.96s)]
*  night, which was last night, Tuesday night. Once again, he kept us waiting for, I think, another [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1735.3600000000001s)]
*  couple of hours past the agreed time we were supposed to do the interview. Once again, he was [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1741.1200000000001s)]
*  costing us time and money. My patience was almost running out. Then I got told in the middle of [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1745.52s)]
*  another debate, he's ready and he'll do it. Then I got told, actually, he's taking the phone call. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1750.56s)]
*  Let's see. Then he came back. His greatness was now available for me to talk to him. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1756.32s)]
*  I did talk to him for about three minutes. That's how long it took this far. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1762.6399999999999s)]
*  When I asked him how he was, he pointed to the backdrop behind him. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1768.0s)]
*  Judge it on the view as the answer to how my life is. Judge me by the view. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1774.6399999999999s)]
*  I said, you seem reasonably happy and content, which is in direct contrast to what [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1780.72s)]
*  is going on with you on social media, where you have 32 million followers. At that point, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1785.52s)]
*  he went into a great theatrical strop. Wait, look right now. You're not going to take [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1792.72s)]
*  inches off my dick, bro. How many followers do I have? How many is it? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1800.72s)]
*  I think you could do the study. You got a whole staff over there. I thought it was [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1808.4s)]
*  32 million. How many is it? You obviously know. No, don't help them out. I'm told it's 33 million [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1811.12s)]
*  now. Congratulations. This is the same guy I remember who has recently said that all Jews [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1820.1599999999999s)]
*  should be whipped. That's one of the many things he said on the thing. He was offended by the fact, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1824.56s)]
*  as he put it, cut a bit off his dick because I hadn't actually got the number of followers right. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1830.1599999999999s)]
*  The number of followers is relevant and significant with Kanye West or Ye, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1836.56s)]
*  as he wants us to call him. He was angry that I called him Ye West. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1841.36s)]
*  I don't use the term West, you know, the whole drop the slave name idea. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1845.6s)]
*  Okay. So we just call you Ye, yeah? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1849.6s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1852.96s)]
*  Even though his ex-profile literally says, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1853.84s)]
*  at Kanye West. But no, he can't be called Ye West. I have no idea what he wants to be called or who [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1857.44s)]
*  he really is. I doubt he does either. But because I misnamed him, that was another egregious offense [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1863.92s)]
*  to be added to the misnumbering of his total number of followers. And so at that point, he said, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1870.48s)]
*  Sir, this is what you get for now. We can circle back when you can count. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1876.64s)]
*  Okay. Having also compared himself to Michael Jackson and John Lennon and said that people [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1883.68s)]
*  like me like to play his music at weddings and funerals and things, but then treat him with such [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1890.64s)]
*  woeful disrespect as to de-number him or wrongly name him. So off he flounced. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1895.1200000000001s)]
*  Studies show that strength training burns more fat than cardio alone and is critical for maintaining [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1902.8000000000002s)]

*  That's GetJackedUp.com. I then took the opportunity to grill his little sidekick, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1952.6399999999999s)]
*  who reminds me a little bit of Mutley from Dastardly and Mutley. If you remember that cartoon strip, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1960.1599999999999s)]
*  he sort of cackles away in the background. Has nothing much to offer. I have no idea who he is, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1965.6s)]
*  genuinely. He's just so me, so peace. I can't remember. Anyway, he's some weird guy. So I [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1971.04s)]
*  decided to ask him, why is Ye, your friend, now such an apparent vile pro-Hitler, pro-Nazi, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1978.08s)]
*  pro-Swastika anti-Semite? I think I find it funny. That's not something that I would do personally. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1986.8s)]
*  I don't whip anybody. You think it's funny, do you? Whipping Jews? Slavery. Using Jews as slaves? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1992.72s)]
*  I think the context of that is funny, yeah. I'm missing the humour. What's the humour? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=1996.72s)]
*  And after a few minutes of that, Soapy decided that he also was not going to be held accountable [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2002.8s)]
*  for anything, at least of all his sycophantasy towards the Hitler lover. So he also walked off. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2008.72s)]
*  Okay. Well, tell him for me he's a snivelling little coward, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2015.36s)]
*  and he's an anti-Semite and a Hitler worshipper. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2018.08s)]
*  And so that's where we were left. Obviously, Soapy then did a whole load of stuff on social media, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2021.3600000000001s)]
*  trying to milk the situation for all it was worth. Kanye, Ye, Mr. West, whatever he is, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2027.2800000000002s)]
*  did a tweet to me saying, hey, let's do a proper interview soon. It's all love, but the trouble is, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2034.5600000000002s)]
*  Ye, it's not all love, is it? It's actually all hate. It's hate towards everybody, including [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2041.1200000000001s)]
*  your family, your ex-wife, towards Jewish people, towards other black people, towards other rappers, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2049.2s)]
*  towards pretty much anyone you can think of. You've become a hate machine, fuelled on social media [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2056.7999999999997s)]
*  because you have 32 or 33 million, as you corrected me, followers amplifying everything you say, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2063.2799999999997s)]
*  all this vicious sentiment to a vast audience. And that is wrong. Elon Musk should remove you [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2069.68s)]
*  from X. He should deplatform you. And to those who say, well, you platformed it, I did, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2076.16s)]
*  because he's not being held to account properly on X. He's getting away with this, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2082.08s)]
*  and he's amplifying his message. Now, if Ye wants to have a proper interview with me about all this, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2086.7999999999997s)]
*  I will do that. But if he wants to play silly games, then he can swing for it. But yeah, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2091.3599999999997s)]
*  if you want to sit in front of me, Ye, get on a plane, come to London, come to my studio, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2097.04s)]
*  and let's do this man to man, face to face. And you can be held accountable for your despicable [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2102.56s)]
*  actions on social media in the last year or so. But let's see if you're manly enough to do that, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2108.96s)]
*  or is it easier for you to attack people like him, like Paris Hilton, the women? Is it easier [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2114.4s)]
*  for you to attack them on social media and not face up to people like me, who might actually hold [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2120.7999999999997s)]
*  you to account for what you've been doing? We'll see. We'll see. Some people think I shouldn't even [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2126.16s)]
*  bother sitting down with you anymore. That's how far your stock has fallen. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJIUSjiscwY&t=2130.88s)]
