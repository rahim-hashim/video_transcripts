# Mob Attacks Woman Mistaken For Pro-Palestine Protester During Israeli Politician's Brooklyn Visit
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc)
*  Pro-Palestinian anti-genocide demonstrators who showed up to an event in Brooklyn. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=0.0s)]
*  And this was an event where they were hosting in Amar Ben-Gavir, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=8.02s)]
*  who is Israel's far right national security minister. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=11.36s)]
*  Fascist war criminal. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  Complete, I mean, complete fascist, completely, complete [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=15.8s)]
*  genocidal maniac to the right of Netanyahu in the Israeli domestic political context. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=19.76s)]
*  For me, it's it's a distinction without difference, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=26.76s)]
*  but it gives you a sense of just like how extreme this person is. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=28.8s)]
*  And this event was held at a synagogue and the pro-Israel crowd [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=33.4s)]
*  will frequently do this kind of thing, including the the real estate group [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=39.88s)]
*  that was hosting hosting illegal sales. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=45.16s)]
*  Selling settlements within the West Bank. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=48.06s)]
*  Why are you protesting a synagogue? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=50.2s)]
*  You're anti-Semitic. So anti-Semitic to do that. Right. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=51.86s)]
*  We're we're going to insult everyone's intelligence. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  We'll do something explicitly political in Zionist at a synagogue [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=57.28s)]
*  so that if there are protests, you can call them anti-Semitic. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=61.28s)]
*  This is something that happens that the that Zionists. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=64.48s)]
*  If there's a protest at a synagogue, they're selling land in it. Right. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  And so there were a few protestors protesting [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=74.06s)]
*  it's more than Gavir speaking there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=79.94s)]
*  And there was a woman who was assaulted [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=82.26s)]
*  by the Zionist crowd where they started following her through the streets. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=85.8s)]
*  And it was men and boys [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=91.5s)]
*  going after this woman who was trying to be escorted by a police officer. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=95.28s)]
*  And I've seen photos of her forehead completely bloodied. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=100.32s)]
*  Is it that's the same woman, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure because there were multiple women assaulted that night. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=108.32s)]
*  OK, by this crowd. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=112.86s)]
*  So I'm not sure which of them this is because in the report [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=114.06s)]
*  we're about to watch, she was kept anonymous. Right. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=117.86s)]
*  So unconfirmed if this is the same person. But [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  the Ryan Grim doing great work over there on DropSky DropSight. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=124.98s)]
*  And I guess this is also an interview with Emily Jashinsky. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=130.54000000000002s)]
*  This woman who wanted to remain anonymous [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=134.58s)]
*  and went on with DropSight and spoke about her experience. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=138.26s)]
*  So, you know, it was kind of later in the evening, around 10, 1030, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=141.82s)]
*  and a helicopter had been hovering over my building for around 30 minutes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=146.42s)]
*  So I went outside to see what was going on. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=151.76s)]
*  And I encountered the aftermath of a protest when I arrived at. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=156.89999999999998s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=163.88s)]
*  So just to clarify, she was not engaged. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=165.48s)]
*  She was not a part of the protests. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=168.42s)]
*  She was not a part of the protest. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=170.3s)]
*  Yeah. Underline that for folks. Yes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=171.84s)]
*  Pro-Israel supporters, collateral damage. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=175.04s)]
*  No, come on. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=179.64s)]
*  Well, that never that never happens. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=181.08s)]
*  This is just going to go after the nasty anti-Semites [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=182.98s)]
*  that are apparently within the anti-Palestinian movement. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=185.08s)]
*  Apparently, just being around these Nazis, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  these fascist brown shirts is a threat to even bystanders. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=191.82s)]
*  And so, yeah, so what happened? What happened next? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=195.56s)]
*  Yeah, so I was standing on the sidewalk. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=199.26s)]
*  There were tons of people, hundreds of people in the street and on the sidewalk. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=202.76s)]
*  Pretty much only Orthodox Jewish people, mostly men. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=207.9s)]
*  And then there were some other neighbors [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=212.96s)]
*  that were there, and they were all Jewish people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=215.3s)]
*  And so I was standing on the sidewalk. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=217.6s)]
*  And I was standing on the sidewalk. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  And then there were some other neighbors like myself [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=222.2s)]
*  standing on the sidewalk, just watching, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=226.5s)]
*  just watching this scene to see what was going on. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=229.33999999999997s)]
*  And I want to say that's an important point, because actually, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=231.54s)]
*  we had reported earlier that you were a pro-Palestine demonstrator. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=233.98s)]
*  And that's not the case. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=239.17999999999998s)]
*  To be clear, you were just sort of a bystander [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=240.57999999999998s)]
*  who was watching the chaos unfold in your neighborhood, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  And so I understand that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=248.7s)]
*  Why did they mistake you for somebody that needed to be assaulted? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=252.88s)]
*  Yeah, so what happened and it happened really quickly [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=258.08s)]
*  was that people near me began filming and I didn't want to be on [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=262.32s)]
*  anyone's camera roll. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=267.02s)]
*  So I pulled out my scarf over my face and I just want to be clear [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  that it was not a kaffiria. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=272.02s)]
*  It wouldn't matter if it was, but it wasn't. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=273.7s)]
*  And that was really that just escalated things almost immediately. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=276.06s)]
*  A woman begins. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=282.32s)]
*  I just want to underline [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=283.56s)]
*  Kathy Hockel and other sort of Democrats passing mask bans [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=285.02s)]
*  on behalf of these sorts of people. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=288.2s)]
*  Well, I did not trying to give Hockel unnecessary flowers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=289.9s)]
*  She's been protecting these institutions, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=294.84s)]
*  the schools that have been going after [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=298.4s)]
*  protesters and has been suppressing pro-Palestine [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=302.28s)]
*  free speech. But that was just Nassau County. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=305.7s)]
*  So it was a county provision [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=308.74s)]
*  that was passed in the North area of Long Island, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=312.5s)]
*  where it's fairly wealthy and more conservative. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=316.68s)]
*  And they asked them was an ostensible reason. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=319.54s)]
*  Anti-Semitism was used as a reason to ban mass as the first in the country [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  and at pro-Palestine protesters [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=326.82s)]
*  because they want to be able to see your face. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=328.72s)]
*  So but but by the way, the ICE Gestapo that can come and pick you up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=330.32s)]
*  Hey, they can wear a mask and cover their faces. No problem. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=335.18s)]
*  Yeah. And they'll blur the official photos of those guys with the state bureaucracy. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=337.44s)]
*  I always say when stuff like that, that's how you know that they're lying [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=342.38s)]
*  about the people they're going after being dangerous, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=345.02s)]
*  because if they were actually dangerous, you would want to identify yourself [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=347.58s)]
*  at least mildly as police officers, because just rolling up [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=351.22s)]
*  on like a dangerous person who might be armed or completely unidentified [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=355.3s)]
*  would be a lot you'd be a lot more likely to be like, you know, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=360.14s)]
*  the victim of some kind of execution in the United States of America. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=363.92s)]
*  Like the fact that they feel comfortable rolling up on people [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  unidentified, just going like, hey, come with us. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=370.02000000000004s)]
*  Shows that they don't think these people are actually very dangerous. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=373.26s)]
*  Right. And I'm sorry, maybe you were right, Matt, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=376.76s)]
*  that the budget bill just passed in New York had extra penalties [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=380.5s)]
*  for criminals wearing masks. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=383.34000000000003s)]
*  So it could that's, you know, that you might be you might have been right about that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=384.66s)]
*  Sorry. It was not a kestia. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=388.1s)]
*  It wouldn't matter if it was, but it wasn't. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  And that was really that just escalated things almost immediately. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=394.48s)]
*  A woman began screaming at me. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  She was already screaming at the police. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=403.18s)]
*  Then she started screaming at me for me that they need to get me out of there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=404.56s)]
*  And almost immediately, a group of like 100 guys encircled me [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=409.18s)]
*  and just started. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=415.38s)]
*  Shouting like just vile insults at me. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=418.48s)]
*  They were saying you're a waste of semen or a failed abortion. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  They were threatening to rape me. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=427.4s)]
*  They tell telling. Does that surprise anybody? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=429.52s)]
*  Anybody at all? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=432.56s)]
*  No. They just seeming or a failed abortion. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=434.06s)]
*  They were threatening to rape me. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=438.44s)]
*  They tell telling me to go back to Palestine. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=440.58s)]
*  And and I also just want to say that I was standing right next to a long line [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=443.32s)]
*  of police and this began to happen. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=448.0s)]
*  I moved closer to the police because I thought that that would afford me [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=450.97999999999996s)]
*  some safety. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=455.78s)]
*  And I was wrong because they did not do anything to intervene. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=456.78s)]
*  And they really just stared straight ahead with their eyes glazed over [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=461.28s)]
*  as if no crime, nothing was happening before their eyes. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  I want to play a little bit of the footage here. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=470.28s)]
*  That's like a metaphor for our entire society right now. Yeah. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=473.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=476.92s)]
*  Yeah, if we can roll that control room. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  So what's on that? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=482.58000000000004s)]
*  You see the fact that you guys let her in is the fact you guys want violence. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  When we went closer. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=488.22s)]
*  You're a little idiot. I live here. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=489.6s)]
*  I'm allowed to be here just as much as you are. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=491.68s)]
*  There's some weird ass. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=494.1s)]
*  There's some weird ass pro-Palestinian motherfucker. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=495.56s)]
*  Is that you? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=497.56s)]
*  You want someone to bend you over and fucking rap you like they're doing to the Jews [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=498.56s)]
*  in fucking Palestine? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=501.36s)]
*  And you can see in that video, the police standing there, he paid taxes to be protected [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=502.36s)]
*  by the police. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=530.52s)]
*  Standing there in that video. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=531.56s)]
*  And so how did you end up getting out of the situation? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=533.14s)]
*  Was anybody other than the police trying to help? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  What happened as you tried to get away from that harassment? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=539.28s)]
*  Yeah, so they tried to leave the situation to get away. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=544.9399999999999s)]
*  Another officer from somewhere else on the street came over and he he saw this mob [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=552.36s)]
*  following me and he tried to escort me home. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=558.0s)]
*  And so we walked in the direction of my home and this just a small of men followed. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=561.92s)]
*  And as they followed, they were again saying, go back to Palestine and in Hebrew [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=567.88s)]
*  shouting death to Arabs. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  They were kicking me in the back repeatedly. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=577.28s)]
*  They were throwing things at my head. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=580.12s)]
*  They hurled a trash can at me. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=584.88s)]
*  They threw a traffic cone at me. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=587.4s)]
*  They were spitting. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=589.92s)]
*  It was just it was really scary. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=591.48s)]
*  And we got the gist here. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=594.52s)]
*  I mean, I appreciate her speaking publicly about it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=597.52s)]
*  And you see even in that footage, like the the. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=602.28s)]
*  The way they speak about Palestinian men in this racist way about them being rapists [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=607.48s)]
*  is just really underneath it, their desire to use rape and sexual violence to silence [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=612.2s)]
*  their critics. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=618.56s)]
*  It is a trope as old as colonialism itself, the positioning of the you know, the brown [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=619.64s)]
*  male as being a hypersexual violent criminal to disguise the inherent patriarchy of the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=626.4799999999999s)]
*  oppressor group. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=633.04s)]
*  It happens everywhere. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I do want to abstract this a little bit because this is not just a unique [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=635.52s)]
*  situation when it comes to a pro-Israel counter protesters being allowed to inflict violence [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=639.1199999999999s)]
*  on pro-Palestine protesters. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=645.92s)]
*  This is the format that the entire far right wants to roll out for protesting in general. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=648.16s)]
*  They want there to be a violent counter protest movement that broadly comes out when any [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=655.12s)]
*  time there is a pro labor protest, any time there's a Black Lives Matter protest, any [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=660.8s)]
*  times there is a pro women's rights protest, they want to make it normalize it being [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=665.76s)]
*  semi-legal for a group of counter protesters to come and try to crack the skulls of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=672.36s)]
*  protesters. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=676.84s)]
*  This is just a test case for that, because they know that when the counter protesters [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=677.68s)]
*  are able to index a marginalized identity like Judaism, that it makes it harder for [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=682.08s)]
*  our society, for people who consider themselves to be liberal and have very shallow [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  understanding of identity to criticize stuff like this, because they're afraid of being [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=691.88s)]
*  considered anti-Semitic. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=695.8s)]
*  They don't understand how someone who has the identity that we consider to be a generally [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=697.16s)]
*  marginalized identity can in certain contexts be the oppressor or be the violent one. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=701.76s)]
*  So this is just using this particular test case, in my opinion, to start normalizing [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=708.0799999999999s)]
*  this for protests in general. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=713.1999999999999s)]
*  We've seen it all over the country. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=714.56s)]
*  We've seen it allowing you to drive through protesters if you want. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=715.6s)]
*  The Kyle Rittenhouse case, they want this to be the way protesters are treated and [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=719.64s)]
*  cops just standing there and letting it happen is going to be the standard. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=723.68s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=729.28s)]
*  I'm so disgusted that Ben Gavir was in my goddamn neighborhood. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=730.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a huge problem. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=735.16s)]
*  I think him speaking around Yale at a nominally Jewish outreach organization founded [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=740.72s)]
*  by in part, Cory Booker and one of the rabbi Shmulis inviting him there and this exact [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=748.8s)]
*  same thing playing out where the Zionists that support the fascists, like terrorists, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=754.28s)]
*  like Ben Gavir, come to speak are staging sort of videos with the protesters saying, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=759.64s)]
*  look, they're against me as a Jew. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=765.56s)]
*  They won't let me walk through. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=767.48s)]
*  I mean, I just had this. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=769.4s)]
*  There's been no food, water or medicine that has gotten into Gaza in 60 days. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=771.76s)]
*  And everyone who would put their feet on the streets for Ben Gavir, everyone in that [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=779.76s)]
*  video harassing that woman loves that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=784.08s)]
*  They might not say it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=788.04s)]
*  Some of them would. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=788.84s)]
*  They might not say it, but every one of them loves that. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=790.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And I think why liberal Zionism is an enabler of fascism is there are some people [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=792.6800000000001s)]
*  who are still naive in the sense of like, they think that everybody has good intentions [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=800.2s)]
*  and that if we all just come together, we can figure something out. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=805.12s)]
*  Disney Zionism. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=808.1600000000001s)]
*  It's their Disney adults. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=809.32s)]
*  Yeah. But it's not that some this is they want they want genocide. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=810.5600000000001s)]
*  They like the taste of blood in their mouth. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=815.9200000000001s)]
*  If they see that folks like that, they see what we see. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=818.0s)]
*  And we see a father wailing over his son's dead body. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=823.04s)]
*  And you can see the fluid of the two year old's brain on the ground. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=827.24s)]
*  They see that as hell. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=833.12s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there is a there's a myth generally in societies that engage in [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=834.96s)]
*  colonialism, that engage in imperialism, that engage in domestic types of fascism, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=841.4399999999999s)]
*  that there is a justification that you can look a pathway you can take to justify it [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=846.8s)]
*  that can soothe your, you know, the more liberal minded people's like inherent sense [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=852.56s)]
*  of what's right and wrong. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=857.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, that's why you hear them weaponizing the idea of systemic sexual assault. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=858.52s)]
*  That's why you see them weaponizing the idea of like crimes against a demarcialized [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=862.56s)]
*  populations in order to like give liberals an out for supporting things that, you know, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=867.2399999999999s)]
*  they might otherwise still support, but still feel bad about supporting and not be able [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=872.6s)]
*  to like advocate for vocally. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=877.52s)]
*  But because, you know, they've been convinced that it's something that like if you just do [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=879.84s)]
*  it for the right reasons, if you just bomb a Muslim country because you want to free [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=882.96s)]
*  the women, that makes it better. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=886.84s)]
*  Like that's like that's a better type of imperialism. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=888.5600000000001s)]
*  And we know that's not the case. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=891.24s)]
*  Right. And this is what makes liberals across the spectrum, not just liberal Zionists, so [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=892.8000000000001s)]
*  dangerous when it comes to issues of like foreign policy and like our foreign imperialist [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=896.76s)]
*  project, because oftentimes they can be convinced to go along with it if you just tell them [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=901.08s)]
*  the right story about what's going on over there that like, you know, tickles their [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=905.1600000000001s)]
*  their particular political concerns. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=910.48s)]
*  I think too, like and I think Brandon and Emma both sort of brought this up in a way [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=913.5200000000001s)]
*  like liberal Zionists can't sort of square the fact that there are people, a large [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=919.1600000000001s)]
*  portion of people who are Zionists who who approve and like that, like Emma was saying, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=925.36s)]
*  like the destruction, like the death. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=932.96s)]
*  And because they need they need to understand like why. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=935.52s)]
*  And, you know, I give them multiple answers. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=938.84s)]
*  There are some people who are just who just are that they like seeing the other there, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=941.6800000000001s)]
*  who they view as their enemy to feel pain, regardless of if it's man, woman or child. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=948.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter. They view them all as as, you know, the other and they don't care. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=952.8399999999999s)]
*  Like, you can't really explain that. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=956.9599999999999s)]
*  But those who do the people who do feel that way but have an explanation, they've shared it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=959.9599999999999s)]
*  We've already we already have the quote unquote rational explanation from people who are fine [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=966.4799999999999s)]
*  or even or even back the killing of Palestinian children. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=972.92s)]
*  And they've explained it in many ways, the most popular ways, probably. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=980.4000000000001s)]
*  They'll grow up to just hate us or attack us anyway. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=984.64s)]
*  So we got to kill them now. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=987.6s)]
*  Like they've explained it like this isn't hard to understand. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=989.08s)]
*  The people that Emma and Brandon and Matt Leck and myself are talking about, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=992.2s)]
*  who just like and support this stuff, they have on camera told you all why. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=997.2800000000001s)]
*  And you are willingly either ignoring it or you're just [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1003.6800000000001s)]
*  blindfully trying to pretend it doesn't exist because they have explained it to you. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1008.24s)]
*  Not only that they have these feelings, but the why they have these feelings. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1012.96s)]
*  And it's a lack of courage. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1017.8s)]
*  It's a lie. It's also I think, you know, I've said this about liberal Zionism before, but [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1019.72s)]
*  there is a there is it's there's a disinterest in doing politics. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1025.52s)]
*  And in my experience, too, the people who are most obtuse about this are often wealthier, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1030.84s)]
*  you know, and this is like if you're even liberal. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1036.48s)]
*  But liberal Zionists who have reexamined and thought differently, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1039.96s)]
*  they're usually like more middle income or whatever, because like the system's [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1044.0s)]
*  working for liberal Zionists that are wealthy and they don't have a understanding [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1047.4s)]
*  of like what it is to be to have the government, a government want to kill you. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1053.48s)]
*  Like, well, I shouldn't say that, of course, there are Jews who experience of Nazi Germany, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1059.32s)]
*  the one of the worst crimes in the history of humanity. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1063.8s)]
*  But in the current present moment, they don't see how [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1066.1599999999999s)]
*  the Palestinian struggle is so similar to that of marginalized groups in this country, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1071.48s)]
*  whether it's Native Americans, black people, etc., or the folks abroad [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1075.9199999999998s)]
*  who we've killed with US imperialism. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1080.0s)]
*  And I mean, it's also just like classic, you know, social psychology, classic [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1082.8799999999999s)]
*  like in-group out-group theory. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1086.76s)]
*  You know, when you're part of the in-group, you often times derive [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1088.44s)]
*  like a positive sense of social worth from being part of that group. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1091.88s)]
*  You get an emotional component to it. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1096.68s)]
*  There's a psychological component to it. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1098.24s)]
*  There's like an intellectual component to it. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1099.92s)]
*  And condemning that group entirely or, you know, like [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1101.8000000000002s)]
*  disaggregating yourself from it is something that takes a lot of like, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1106.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, work. It takes a lot of work because you oftentimes still value [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1110.2s)]
*  being part of the group as a whole. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1113.88s)]
*  And that also prevents you from having empathy from people who are outside [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1115.44s)]
*  of that group. You know, like we see that with Western chauvinists all time, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1118.44s)]
*  a lot of like liberals, a lot of leftists still like espouse [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1121.2s)]
*  the values of like the American project and refuse to engage with the fact [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1124.68s)]
*  that that project has been steeped in blood. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1128.72s)]
*  And the reason why is not because they don't know, it's because they're part [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1130.6000000000001s)]
*  of the group, they're an American and they don't want to look inwardly [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1133.4s)]
*  about what that would mean for themselves and their own identity. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1136.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is there's a question that sort of could be left [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1138.64s)]
*  in the air that could imply some sort of anti-Semitic thing when people say like, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1141.88s)]
*  well, why do you think the Israelis are so hateful or something like that? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1145.8400000000001s)]
*  And it has nothing to do with Judaism. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1149.28s)]
*  It has nothing to do with any holy book. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1151.0s)]
*  It's any people put into a situation where your number is [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1152.92s)]
*  is viewed as rivalrous with the indigenous people will develop hatred. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1158.72s)]
*  That's the exact same reason. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1162.96s)]
*  You know, people on the Dakota prairie hated the suit to the point [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1164.88s)]
*  where the Lakota to the point where they genocide and you had things [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1168.4s)]
*  like like Custer, right? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1173.72s)]
*  Like this sort of hatred is structural. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1175.92s)]
*  It is not part of any sort of faith. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1179.04s)]
*  It is not part of any sort of people. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1181.36s)]
*  It is a structural thing when you put people into a situation, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1183.8799999999999s)]
*  like I said, where your demographic is viewed as the one that needs to be preserved [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1186.96s)]
*  and the others are a rival to it. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1190.56s)]
*  There's no way that that can be seen as anything that you can do anything [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1192.6s)]
*  other than engender hate in the population. Yeah. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1196.36s)]
*  Yeah. And it's not the Americans aren't like guilty of that exact same thing. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1199.56s)]
*  And, you know, I think a lot of times people want to look at Israel [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1202.92s)]
*  as being a discreet example of like a way a country could be that there's no sort of, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1205.68s)]
*  you know, and this is even when they're criticizing it. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1210.8400000000001s)]
*  There's no sort of comparison to like Americans are a lot like this, too. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1212.68s)]
*  It's just, you know, by nature of the historical particularism of Israel [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1216.72s)]
*  and where it is, there's a lot more of that. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1220.3200000000002s)]
*  But look at how people talk about Mexicans in this country. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1222.5600000000002s)]
*  Look at how they they're all rapists. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1225.28s)]
*  They're all murderers. They're all gang members. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1227.28s)]
*  We're putting them in camps, too. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1228.8400000000001s)]
*  Like, are they the exact same type of camps that the Israelis are putting? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1230.48s)]
*  You know, Palestinians, like are they like Sedeem on? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1234.56s)]
*  No, they're not that bad yet. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1237.96s)]
*  But we're working our way up to there. Right. And sorry, Brandon. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1239.64s)]
*  I just want to say like this is this is the West Bank. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1243.64s)]
*  If you want to put this up, Russ, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1245.88s)]
*  it's the West Bank of the Missouri River. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1248.96s)]
*  And that is a guardhouse meant for the outpost of the Custer and folks [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1251.6000000000001s)]
*  to kill Native Americans if they threaten the city. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1256.48s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1259.2s)]
*  The same thing you see in guardhouses that are patrolled by Israelis. Yep. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHB1W0JlHMc&t=1260.52s)]
