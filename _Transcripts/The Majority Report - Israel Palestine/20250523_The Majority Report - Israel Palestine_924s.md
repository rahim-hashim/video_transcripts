# Noem Makes WILD Claims About "Hamas Agents" At Harvard
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg)
*  understand what's going on here in terms of Harvard. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=0.0s)]
*  Harvard was, I think, the first university to fight back [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=3.5s)]
*  when the Trump administration wanted them to kowtow [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=7.0s)]
*  to the administration. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  Remember, this is also a function. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=13.22s)]
*  The administration, I don't know if they fell into this [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=18.04s)]
*  or this was an act of strategy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=22.66s)]
*  I would probably imagine the latter. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=26.28s)]
*  They, did you ever print that out for me? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=28.66s)]
*  We can read it here. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=32.5s)]
*  I'll be able to see it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=33.22s)]
*  The Trump administration has been using in part this notion [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=36.82s)]
*  that there was rising anti-Semitism on campuses. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=42.74s)]
*  And the agenda of Zionist ideology in this country [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=47.06s)]
*  to stifle criticism of Israel and their act of genocide. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=55.26s)]
*  And that became the fig leaf in which they were basically [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=62.46s)]
*  extorting law firms and universities over the past, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=68.58s)]
*  I guess, five months now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=75.42s)]
*  Harvard was one of the early or the first, one of the biggest, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=77.82s)]
*  certainly, universities to balk at that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=83.34s)]
*  Then we started to have some law firms who said, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=87.18s)]
*  we're not going to capitulate to your insistence [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  that we fund immigration attacks on people. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=95.14s)]
*  And so the administration's obviously [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=102.22s)]
*  been looking for ways to deal with this. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=104.34s)]
*  Here is a letter written to Harvard from Homeland Security. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=106.94000000000001s)]
*  Harvard Student and Exchange Visitor Program [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=116.5s)]
*  De-certification. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  I'm writing to inform you that effective immediately Harvard [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  University Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=122.34s)]
*  is revoked. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=126.9s)]
*  So I think 25% of Harvard students, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=128.38s)]
*  I would imagine across both undergraduate and graduate, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  are foreign. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=134.78s)]
*  Yep, it's around, so it's like a fourth of their student body, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=136.14s)]
*  6,800 international students at Harvard. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=140.82s)]
*  And they often pay full price. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=146.98s)]
*  They end up subsidizing other students there in some respects. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  As I explained to you in April, it's a privilege [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  to enroll foreign students, and it's also a privilege [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=156.38s)]
*  to employ aliens on campus. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=158.7s)]
*  Psychotic. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=160.82s)]
*  Nazis. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  All universities must comply with the DHS security [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=163.82s)]
*  requirements, including reporting requirements [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=167.73999999999998s)]
*  under Student Exchange Visitor Programs [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=170.14s)]
*  to maintain this privilege. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=171.98s)]
*  As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=173.94s)]
*  to provide DHS pertinent information [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=179.34s)]
*  is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=183.38s)]
*  and employs racist diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=188.18s)]
*  you have lost this privilege. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=192.08s)]
*  None of what they're outlining, incidentally, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=199.28s)]
*  is in any way criminal. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=201.44s)]
*  Or I don't know that any of this is statutory. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=204.72000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=209.56s)]
*  That's my question. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=210.0s)]
*  Well, I was trying to look into it a little, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  but we can touch on that after we get [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=212.72000000000003s)]
*  done with this insane letter. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=215.56s)]
*  The revocation of your Student Exchange Visitor Program [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  certification means that Harvard's prohibited [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=220.4s)]
*  from having any aliens on F or J non-immigrant status [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=222.8s)]
*  for the 2025-2026 school year. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=225.84s)]
*  This decertification also means that existing aliens [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=229.08s)]
*  on F or J non-immigrant status must transfer [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  to another university in order to maintain [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=234.4s)]
*  their non-immigrant status. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=236.96s)]
*  This action should not surprise you, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=240.88s)]
*  and it is an unfortunate result of Harvard's failure [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=242.8s)]
*  to comply with simple reporting requirements. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  So here she goes into this timeline. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=250.28s)]
*  I just want to say, this sentence, I mean, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=250.78s)]
*  I don't know who's writing these letters, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=254.24s)]
*  but that sentence is not consistent with what [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=256.0s)]
*  they said in the first paragraph. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=261.76s)]
*  This action is a result of Harvard's failure [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=264.04s)]
*  to comply with simple reporting requirements. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=267.14s)]
*  And as we go back up, there were others that they clicked. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=269.24s)]
*  It's an unsafe campus, employs racist diversity, equity, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=274.08s)]
*  inclusion policies, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=277.48s)]
*  No. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=283.88s)]
*  She says down here, this is just a function [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=284.88s)]
*  of reporting requirements. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=288.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=290.6s)]
*  So within three paragraphs, they have contradicted themselves. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=291.1s)]
*  She's admitted that it's not just that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=295.16s)]
*  It's also their speech. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=298.36s)]
*  On April 16, 2025, I requested records [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  pertaining to non-immigrant students [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=303.92s)]
*  enrolled at Harvard University, including information [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=305.52s)]
*  regarding misconduct and other offenses [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=307.88s)]
*  that would render students inadmissible or removal. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  Harvard's counsel provided information [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=315.52s)]
*  that he represented as responsive to my request. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=317.24s)]
*  It was not. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=319.68s)]
*  And Harvard's suit against the federal government today [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=320.76s)]
*  addresses this. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  And this seems to be kind of where [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=325.68s)]
*  the core of their case rests on. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=327.28s)]
*  Harvard did produce the information [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=331.68s)]
*  that they asked for within the timeline. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=333.47999999999996s)]
*  She essentially admits it, Christy Dome, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=335.38s)]
*  and says that the information was not [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  responsive to her request without providing [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=340.3s)]
*  any evidence. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=343.06s)]
*  And so they give her the information. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=344.34s)]
*  DHS says it's insufficient. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=347.38s)]
*  And then they revoke the student exchange visa authority, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  regardless. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=354.18s)]
*  So this is just a mafia shakedown. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=355.14s)]
*  As a courtesy that Harvard was not legally entitled to, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=357.14s)]
*  the acting DHS general counsel respond on my behalf [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=360.1s)]
*  afforded Harvard another opportunity to comply. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=363.5s)]
*  Harvard, again, provided an insufficient response. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=365.82s)]
*  Consequences must follow to send a clear signal [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=368.7s)]
*  and all universities that want to enjoy [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=371.18s)]
*  the privilege of enrolling foreign students. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=372.78s)]
*  That the Trump administration will enforce the law, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=375.74s)]
*  root out the evils of anti-Americanism [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=377.82s)]
*  and anti-Semitism in society and campuses. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=379.74s)]
*  Head to the second page where we can see the laws [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=383.42s)]
*  that she's citing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=385.5s)]
*  Obviously, there are laws that she can point to. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=387.62s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=391.98s)]
*  Please be advised that materially false, fictitious, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=392.9s)]
*  or fraudulent information may subject you [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=395.94s)]
*  to criminal prosecution. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=397.65999999999997s)]
*  Other criminal- [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  Hate that stuff. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=400.26s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=400.78s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=402.78s)]
*  So she's referring to the law that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=403.58s)]
*  says you can't lie to us when you send us information. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  But she's not referring to the law that they already broke. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=412.94s)]
*  I expect to full and complete responses [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=417.21999999999997s)]
*  to the following request. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=419.06s)]
*  Any and all records, whether official or informal, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=420.06s)]
*  in the possession of Harvard University regarding [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=422.42s)]
*  illegal activity, whether on or off campus, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=427.1s)]
*  by a non-immigrant student enrolled in Harvard University [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=429.58000000000004s)]
*  for the last five years. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=433.58000000000004s)]
*  That's a crazy request. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=437.3s)]
*  A non-immigrant seems to be all the students. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=438.90000000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=447.54s)]
*  If I'm a citizen, I'm a non-immigrant student. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=449.02s)]
*  That's why I think of myself a non-immigrant. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=452.74s)]
*  But I wonder if that's what they meant, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=455.58s)]
*  or if they just meant people who are here on visas. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=457.26s)]
*  That aren't immigrating. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=461.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=462.62s)]
*  OK. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=463.18s)]
*  I mean, it's unclear, because this [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=463.94s)]
*  was written by a three-year-old. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=466.22s)]
*  Any and all records regarding dangers or violent activity, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=468.7s)]
*  whether on or off campus, by a non-immigrant student enrolled [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=476.42s)]
*  at Harvard University in the last five years. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=479.5s)]
*  The idea that they would keep record, maybe they do. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=482.54s)]
*  But they also have a duty to protect their students [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=486.54s)]
*  from the federal government. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=488.86s)]
*  I would imagine there's privacy in question. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=490.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, look at the way Shipman got booed by Columbia. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=493.1s)]
*  They're opening themselves up to massive liability [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=495.66s)]
*  with their student body by violating their privacy [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=498.18s)]
*  because of this stupid-ass letter from Kristi Noem. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=501.06s)]
*  If you're an international student, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=503.54s)]
*  why would you go to a school that [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=505.04s)]
*  is willing to give all this information to the Trump [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=506.72s)]
*  administration? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=509.20000000000005s)]
*  No, of course you won't. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=509.6s)]
*  And they're not. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  And good for Harvard for standing up here. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=510.88s)]
*  They have the endowment to do it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=512.64s)]
*  Regarding deprivation, the same request regarding deprivation [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=514.2s)]
*  of rights of other classmates or university personnel, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=517.84s)]
*  whether on or off campus, any and all disciplinary records [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=520.52s)]
*  of all non-immigrant students, any and all audio or video [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=524.36s)]
*  footage of any protest activity. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=530.64s)]
*  Signed, Kristi Noem. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=534.48s)]
*  There you go. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  Footage of the protest activity. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=537.3199999999999s)]
*  So, you're going to comply with us [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=539.12s)]
*  while we violate the free speech rights of your student body. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=542.28s)]
*  Or we're basically going to go for your purse. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=546.08s)]
*  Because that's, we touched on it just a second ago, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=547.88s)]
*  these international students tend [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  to pay full price, including room and board. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=555.92s)]
*  So this is a hit at Harvard's finances, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=558.32s)]
*  which is what they're trying to do, what it's designed to do. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=560.96s)]
*  And it's clear that we haven't talked too much about it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=564.6800000000001s)]
*  But there was reporting a few days ago in the New York Times [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=567.48s)]
*  about how the Heritage Foundation, which [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  was behind Project 2025, has this separate project called [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=573.24s)]
*  Project Esther that's using the same tactics to crack down [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=576.6400000000001s)]
*  on the pro-Palestinian movement that are [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=582.8800000000001s)]
*  being used in Project 2025. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=584.6s)]
*  And it seems like this is very much out [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=587.0s)]
*  of the playbook of what was outlined in that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=589.36s)]
*  There is a question in someone just [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=593.1600000000001s)]
*  I am just about the specific law that protects students' education [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=594.76s)]
*  records is FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=601.88s)]
*  Act. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  FERPA requires written consent from parents or eligible students [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=609.2s)]
*  before their education records can be disclosed to third parties. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  It is unclear to me whether education records constitute [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=615.96s)]
*  any records held about the student [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=623.48s)]
*  by the educational institution. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=626.48s)]
*  But nevertheless, it's quite clear [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=629.44s)]
*  that there is no legal basis for what they're asking for, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=632.9200000000001s)]
*  because they don't even cite a law. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=636.24s)]
*  Here is Kristi Noem on Fox News trying to explain this. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=639.92s)]
*  On themselves, they have promoted and allowed [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=647.92s)]
*  violent activity on campus. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=651.24s)]
*  They have allowed anti-Semitism participation [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=653.36s)]
*  with CCP and Chinese infiltration and influence [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=656.56s)]
*  on their campus. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=661.8s)]
*  And they haven't protected their students. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=662.7199999999999s)]
*  So we have given them multiple opportunities [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=664.8s)]
*  to share criminal activity with us, backgrounds on these students, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=667.56s)]
*  to let us conduct the oversight into this program that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=671.52s)]
*  is our responsibility. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=674.4799999999999s)]
*  Pause it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=675.64s)]
*  Incidentally, apparently, all these students [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=676.14s)]
*  can go enroll in another college and they'll be fine. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=678.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=682.8s)]
*  So we have all these Hamas Chinese, these Chino Hamas agents. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=683.3199999999999s)]
*  The Chicom Islamists. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=689.8s)]
*  And as long as they go to a different college, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=691.4s)]
*  they'll be OK. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=693.8399999999999s)]
*  Is that what, like? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=696.0s)]
*  For sure, Sam, that's what we're saying, OK? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=698.12s)]
*  Also, I really liked the- [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=701.4s)]
*  You're under the cone of protection by Cornell University. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=702.76s)]
*  I liked the beginning when she talked about how violent they are. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=708.16s)]
*  And they're just the whole B-roll that Fox News is showing [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=711.76s)]
*  is this giant protestor that says, protest that says, let Gaza live. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=715.4s)]
*  And then also now here, stop the genocide. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=720.0s)]
*  Divesting. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=722.76s)]
*  That's kind of violence against investors. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=723.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=725.12s)]
*  That is our responsibility and they have refused to do so. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=727.2s)]
*  So today I sent them a letter that [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=730.32s)]
*  said they will no longer be allowed [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=732.2s)]
*  to participate in this student exchange visitor program. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=733.8s)]
*  And that's up to 27% of their enrolled students. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=737.52s)]
*  So it's significant to any foreign student that [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=740.72s)]
*  wishes to get an education in this country that [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=744.2s)]
*  is attending Harvard and not participating [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=746.48s)]
*  in this criminal activity. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=749.04s)]
*  They will have to find another university [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=750.2s)]
*  because Harvard has chosen instead to not protect their students [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=752.8s)]
*  and to allow this kind of violent and discriminatory action continue. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=756.52s)]
*  So as you mentioned, violence. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=760.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=762.92s)]
*  And the law that they have violated, the law of privilege, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=768.6s)]
*  Words are not violence. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=770.12s)]
*  Words can be hateful, but words are not violence. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=771.72s)]
*  Bombs are violence. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=775.64s)]
*  And- [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=776.76s)]
*  Especially not words that are like, stop the genocide [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=777.16s)]
*  and divest from Israel. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=779.36s)]
*  That's actually the opposite of violence. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=780.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=782.04s)]
*  But I mean, I don't know why she even [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=782.92s)]
*  needed to write that letter. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=784.92s)]
*  Couldn't Trump have just done habeas corpus [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=786.0s)]
*  and all of this could have been solved? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=788.88s)]
*  I've been told by her that that's a presidential authority. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=790.64s)]
*  Habeas universit- [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=793.76s)]
*  Habeas. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=794.7199999999999s)]
*  Habeas. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=795.28s)]
*  Habeas. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=795.8s)]
*  Habeas. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=796.28s)]
*  Corpus. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=796.92s)]
*  Corpus. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=797.64s)]
*  I like it's humanistic stuff. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=798.16s)]
*  Habeas, chicken nugget, and peace. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=800.4s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=803.0s)]
*  So Harvard is, I mean, they immediately [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=808.16s)]
*  filed suit. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=811.28s)]
*  And it's going to be interesting to see what happens when some of [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=812.64s)]
*  like the biggies, like apparently the future queen of Belgium [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=817.72s)]
*  just finished her freshman year at Harvard. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=825.24s)]
*  No word on whether she's a secret Chai Com- [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=828.6800000000001s)]
*  Hamas- [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=831.92s)]
*  Hamas- [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=832.4s)]
*  Anti-Semite. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=835.16s)]
*  Anti-Semite. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=836.04s)]
*  Plant. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=838.48s)]
*  Secret plant. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=839.5600000000001s)]
*  Or what? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=840.52s)]
*  Sleeper cell. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=841.16s)]
*  Sleeper cell. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=841.92s)]
*  But I would imagine at one point there's going to be people there. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=843.72s)]
*  And where's that Bill Ackerman guy? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=847.24s)]
*  Didn't he? Is that what his name is? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=850.6s)]
*  Oh, he's thrilled about this. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=852.36s)]
*  This is what his money- he was a big Trump donor. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=854.04s)]
*  He was having to bankroll this himself back in the day with Harvard, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=856.16s)]
*  where he was putting out LED doxing trucks outside of the campus [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=859.92s)]
*  with the names and photos and information of the students there. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=864.92s)]
*  Now he's got a Project Esther to do it. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=868.12s)]
*  And he does all the stuff tweeting from the elliptical too, apparently. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=871.2s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  And by the way- [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=876.24s)]
*  Project Brain Drain is what's going on in this country right now. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=876.9200000000001s)]
*  And just got to say, this is disgusting and it's not making Jewish students safe. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=880.32s)]
*  It's making them unsafe to continue to use them for the Trump administration's [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=884.44s)]
*  fascist actions. It's disgusting to continue to conflate anti-Zionism [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=888.44s)]
*  and anti-Semitism for this authoritarian crackdown. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=892.6400000000001s)]
*  It's incredibly dangerous. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=894.84s)]
*  I saw three young Orthodox boys walking on my way to work this morning. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=896.4s)]
*  They had anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism placards. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=900.4399999999999s)]
*  Good for them. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgh0ZkLcYRg&t=904.9599999999999s)]
