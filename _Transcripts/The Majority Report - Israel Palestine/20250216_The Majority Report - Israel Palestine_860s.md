Zachary Foster, author of the Palestine Nexus newsletter, joins to discuss Trump’s recent announcements and intentions to “take over” the Gaza Strip.

Zachary Foster and Emma then jump right into Trump’s recent declaration of intent to ethnically cleanse Gaza under U.S. control while sitting beside Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, touching on the stunning revelation of the White House’s seeming internal numbers on the total Gazan death count (around 500k) as well as the ongoing struggle to survive outside of conflict in Gaza. Next, Foster dives into the extensive role Saudi Arabia plays in pushing back against the US-Israeli imperial advancements, with their outward insistence on Palestinian statehood somewhat conflicted by Crown Prince MBS’ extensive efforts to normalize relations with Israel as well as to launch Saudi Arabia into an era of “techno-utopianism,” two agendas perfectly-aligned with the Trump Administration, before touching on the stunning international solidarity being shown on behalf of Palestine in the wake of Trump breaking from Biden’s tact of *silently* supporting the ethnic cleansing.

# Did Trump's Ethnic Cleansing Scheme Reveal Gaza's Actual Death Count?
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [February 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ)
*  We are back and we are joined once again by Zachary Foster, historian of Palestine, received his PhD in Near Eastern Studies from Princeton University. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=0.0s)]
*  His newsletter Palestine Nexus is an essential follow. You archive so much Palestinian history, which is as important as ever right now as, you know, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=8.0s)]
*  Israel has destroyed basically every educational institution in Gaza. Zach, welcome back to the show. Good to see you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=19.0s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me back. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=26.0s)]
*  For sure. So I guess just we'll start here from the beginning of the week where Benjamin Netanyahu visited the United States, met with Trump, and during their media appearances, Trump endorsed the ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=28.0s)]
*  Can you just give us a quick rundown of the developments from the past few days? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=46.0s)]
*  Well, we've all seen the press conference in which Donald Trump incited ethnic cleansing. He called for the complete removal of all Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=52.0s)]
*  Before the war that was 2.2, 2.3 million people. He threw out a figure of a million and a half, 1.7 million, 1.8 million. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=68.0s)]
*  It's unclear if he meant that if he was implying the remaining Palestinians had already been killed or if they had already left. It's unclear. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=76.0s)]
*  We have no idea how many people are in Gaza now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=84.0s)]
*  But can I just say to add to that really quickly, you know, people are saying, oh, you believe him now or whatever. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=86.0s)]
*  It's not about believing him. It's that he's dumb enough to accidentally let slip what could actually be the internal numbers that they are estimating about the death toll, which given that deficit, it would indicate 500,000. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=92.0s)]
*  And we know that it's up well over, I would say, you know, 100,000 at this point. It's somewhere between those two figures. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=105.0s)]
*  That's my theory on that front. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=113.0s)]
*  Was it already last summer we had a group of American physicians, some 99 American health care workers report out about 118,000 if I'm not wrong. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=115.0s)]
*  We had the Lancet estimate of 180,000. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=124.0s)]
*  The answer is we just have no idea how many people are killed because we don't have heavy equipment in Gaza. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=127.0s)]
*  You can't actually dig people out of the rubble. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=132.0s)]
*  And even if you could, so many bodies have been completely vaporized, have completely incinerated into ash. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=134.0s)]
*  And so it's just totally unclear how many people have been killed. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=140.0s)]
*  Could it be upwards of two, three, four hundred thousand people? Yes, it could be. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=143.0s)]
*  That is exactly what experts have been telling us for over already over a year now. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=148.0s)]
*  So it's incredibly dire, the situation in Gaza. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=153.0s)]
*  We had reports coming out the Euro Human Rights Watch reported just this week that that humanitarian aid is not getting into Gaza. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=158.0s)]
*  We know that trucks are entering Gaza, but they're not actually entering the north. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=169.0s)]
*  And much of what is entering Gaza is actually not essential equipment. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=173.0s)]
*  The hospitals have not been replenished. There's no MRI machines going in. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=176.0s)]
*  There's 80 plus percent of the wells in Gaza have been destroyed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=180.0s)]
*  None of the equipment to repair any of the wells has entered Gaza. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=184.0s)]
*  So the humanitarian effort is slow and it's not meeting the needs of the population. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=188.0s)]
*  And so, you know, right now we have a situation in which the sitting U.S. president is declaring his intent to carry out war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing on public TV. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=194.0s)]
*  It's totally unreal. It's almost unprecedented. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=208.0s)]
*  At least the Biden administration attempted to hide its attempts to ethically clean Gaza. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=211.0s)]
*  You recall that in the early month or two after October 7th, Blinken made his trip to Tel Aviv and he discussed for hours and hours with the begging the Netanyahu administration to allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=216.0s)]
*  But he was up. But the Biden administration was totally on board with ethnic cleansing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=232.0s)]
*  Biden made a trip or Blinken made a trip around the Middle East trying to convince Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, president of Egypt, to accept refugees. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=237.0s)]
*  He tried to convince Jordan to accept Palestinian refugees. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=244.0s)]
*  They all said no way. And they've all said no way again. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=248.0s)]
*  Not just Egypt, not just Jordan, which declared recently this past week that they would they would declare war against Israel if this plan to ethically cleanse Palestinians was executed on. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=251.0s)]
*  And then you saw the comments made by Saudi Arabia just in the past day or two in which the Saudi Arabian foreign minister wearing a kaffirah said, absolutely not. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=263.0s)]
*  There's no way we're going to allow this to happen. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=274.0s)]
*  There's no way we're going to agree to normalize with Israel unless there is a Palestinian state, something Trump lied about. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=276.0s)]
*  He just openly stated what was a bold faced lie that Saudi Arabia had in fact agreed to some kind of normalization deal with Israel without the establishment of a Palestinian state. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=284.0s)]
*  So Trump is totally deranged. He's unpredictable. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=298.0s)]
*  It's unclear exactly where these comments came from. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=301.0s)]
*  It seemed almost that Netanyahu was almost surprised by this proposition. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=304.0s)]
*  Pleasantly surprised. Pleasantly surprised. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=308.0s)]
*  Just that smirk on his face during the press conference where he's smiling, where he's smirking while Trump is openly declaring that Gaza will become, I don't know, some US territory, some, you know, annexed into the United States. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=311.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just totally deranged. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=324.0s)]
*  Yeah, but seeing him smirk like that, the thoughts that were going through my brain, I'm not going to articulate it, but some vivid imagery I had. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=326.0s)]
*  Jordan and Saudi Arabia, can you talk about the sincerity of their opposition? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=338.0s)]
*  My concern is that in particular Saudi Arabia, because they don't have, they're worried about, yes, riots in the streets, but there's still no democracy there and direct way to hold MBS and that government accountable. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=347.0s)]
*  Are you concerned that their public opposition is more window dressing than what the conversations look like behind the scenes? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=361.0s)]
*  There's no doubt that that is correct. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=370.0s)]
*  On the eve of October 7th, there were very, very serious, very, very high level discussions between senior Saudi officials and US officials and Israeli officials with regard to a normalization plan. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=373.0s)]
*  The rumors, there were even rumors that this had already effectively been agreed on and there were just some details to iron out. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=385.0s)]
*  That was October 6th, 2023. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=392.0s)]
*  So there's no doubt and that was coming on the heels of a 17 year long blockade of the Gaza Strip in which Israel suffocated the civilian population, imposing collective punishment on 2.2 million people. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=394.0s)]
*  After four wars in which Israel killed 4,000 plus innocent Palestinian civilians, 1,000 plus in 2008-9, 1,500 plus in 2014, many hundred in 2012, many hundred in 2021, many hundred in 2018-19. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=405.0s)]
*  So the Saudi government has no regard for Palestinian human life, Palestinian civilian loss of life in the occupied Palestinian territories. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=420.0s)]
*  Recall as well that it was Mohammed bin Salman who openly, I think, confessed it was a leaked report, but he basically said, I don't really care much about the Palestinians. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=428.0s)]
*  I mean, this has been known for a long time now. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=437.0s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman carried out a five, six, seven year long war on Yemen, killing tens of thousands of Yemeni's children. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=440.0s)]
*  MBS has no regard whatsoever for innocent loss of life at all. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=446.0s)]
*  He butchered Jamal Khashoggi in the infamous murder of a Washington Post journalist in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul a couple of years ago. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=451.0s)]
*  This is a person who has no regard for innocent life, for journalists, for humanitarian workers, for Palestinian civilians in Gaza. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=462.0s)]
*  He is obsessed with kind of a 2030 vision in which Saudi Arabia is going to remake the Middle East. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=470.0s)]
*  His plan is to build a city called Neom on the Red Sea coast in which American entrepreneurs, businessmen around the world will create this kind of enclave, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=478.0s)]
*  this almost a kind of a little city in the desert, a westernized city where men and women will intermingle. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=491.0s)]
*  But ultimately, that's his vision for the Middle East. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=501.0s)]
*  It's a kind of almost a techno utopia, but it has nothing to do with human rights. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=505.0s)]
*  It has nothing to do with women's rights. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=510.0s)]
*  It has nothing to do with Palestinian rights. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=511.0s)]
*  It's fundamentally about building a kind of a techno utopia to transition off the Saudi economy from oil to something else. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=513.0s)]
*  But that's his vision. It has nothing to do with Palestinians. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=521.0s)]
*  You know that fits in extremely well with the tech billionaires, like anarcho-capitalist vision, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=523.0s)]
*  whether it's Praxis and these other privatized cities that Andreessen and Musk and Peter Thiel are investing in. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=531.0s)]
*  You know, that's like Abu Dhabi, I mean, it's different, but that's also the vision, right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=542.0s)]
*  More of that, more to increase tourism and not be so reliant on oil. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=549.0s)]
*  And then if it's a tech utopia, that means surveillance and weapons technology then, right? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=554.0s)]
*  Like that's the vision is a hub of tech billionaires or tech billions, but then the surveillance and weapons technology that comes from it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=561.0s)]
*  It's well known that Israel's military tech, its spy tech, is some of the most cutting edge military tech and spy tech in the world. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=571.0s)]
*  I mean, we all know what Pegasus is capable of. They can tap any phone in the world without having the owner of that phone touch anything, tap anything, click anything. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=580.0s)]
*  It is total surveillance. And the Saudis are already using that tech. We know that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=589.0s)]
*  Khashoggi, I believe his fiancee had her phone tapped and was being monitored by Pegasus, an Israeli spy tech firm. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=595.0s)]
*  So we know what the goals of this Saudi administration are. They are to clamp down on any dissent whatsoever within the kingdom. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=605.0s)]
*  They are to clamp down even on dissent from outside of the kingdom, as you saw with the Khashoggi assassination. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=614.0s)]
*  They are to strengthen the alliance with Israel, to create a new Middle East, one in which Israel is supreme, one in which the Palestinians are completely irrelevant. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=621.0s)]
*  But as we saw, because Trump's comments are so blatant, so overt, so with total disregard for the norms of saying things, of doing the quiet part quietly, he's blowing things up. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=632.0s)]
*  He's actually really messing things up for Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia, like we said, isn't fundamentally interested in the Palestinian state. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=650.0s)]
*  They don't really care about that. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=656.0s)]
*  And Trump's just overt disregard for international humanitarian law, his open promotion of ethnic cleansing is throwing a wrench in the Saudi plan for the future of the Middle East. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=659.0s)]
*  Because he's being too clear about it, right? And to be clear, the Biden administration, with some of the same folks that stayed on, like Brett McGurk, was pursuing the Abraham Accords and normalization with Saudi Arabia, which include potentially defense promises. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=671.0s)]
*  You think we're entangled in Israel? Wait till the US taxpayers have to say we're going to defend Saudi Arabia to our second greatest ally in the Middle East or whatever. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=688.0s)]
*  But they still weren't able to get that over the hump with Biden. That is what you're saying, right? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=698.0s)]
*  But because the genocide of the Palestinians was active, so live streamed, so egregious, such an obvious international crime that with mass condemnation for most of the rest of the world, is that almost more helpful in our current moment right now to have this on the table and being like, okay, he threw down the gauntlet. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=706.0s)]
*  Ethnic cleansing is the goal of this administration. And then maybe that boxes in MBS and Jordan and all of them. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=731.0s)]
*  It's fair to say that there's something particularly nefarious about saying one thing in public and doing the opposite in private. And that's exactly what the Biden administration was doing for 15 and a half months. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=741.0s)]
*  They said in public, oh, we're pushing for a ceasefire. You recall AOC on the DNC stage. Kamala Harris is doing everything in her power for a ceasefire. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=753.0s)]
*  Working tirelessly. Yeah. Working tirelessly. When in fact it was all nonsense. And there's something particularly nefarious and dangerous about that. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=763.0s)]
*  Because we let down our guard. And those of us who actually do want to ceasefire and who are gullible or naive are going to believe that. And we let down our guard and do nothing. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=771.0s)]
*  Whereas we are seeing in real time the immunity systems kick in of Saudi Arabia, of Jordan, of Egypt, of all of Europe. I mean, when was the last time you heard a German foreign minister get up and say, no, Gaza will not be ethnically cleansed. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzD1phB00QQ&t=781.0s)]
*  It is the immunity systems are kicking in. And so that's very important. It's very important to see someone say what they mean, to say what they plan to do openly, clearly, without any ambiguity, which is exactly what Trump is doing.
