# Did Israel Target Greta Thunberg In Drone Attack On Gaza Aid Ship?
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI)
*  Israeli drones fired at a freedom flotilla that where did this take off from? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=0.0s)]
*  So it, I'm not sure where it took off from initially, but it was supposed to stop in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=9.72s)]
*  Malta to pick up dozens more people, which include Greta Thunberg, and also had been [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=15.52s)]
*  previously carrying dozens of people when it was on its way, when it was hit by drone attacks. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=23.959999999999997s)]
*  And the vessel had humanitarian aid on it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  It was a peaceful convoy of folks trying to get food to Gaza, because I need to remind [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=34.56s)]
*  people, if you haven't seen the images of people starving to death there and little [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  babies starving to death there, this may be the worst situation in terms of malnutrition [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=45.44s)]
*  and starvation that we've been in since the genocide began. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=49.64s)]
*  Donald Trump has basically allowed Israel to do an entire blockade of both medicine [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=52.96s)]
*  and food and water coming into Gaza for the last 60 plus days. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=59.68s)]
*  And we don't know the full true extent of how horrible it is, but it's been said that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  it's basically as dangerous as any time period right now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=71.04s)]
*  And so this was an attempt to kind of bring food there or at least it was a display to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=74.28s)]
*  put pressure on the international community because of the direness of the situation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=81.76s)]
*  But and Israel struck it and apparently the timing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=88.72s)]
*  We don't know, but the she was supposed it was right before Greta was supposed to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=96.0s)]
*  board. That's I mean, we don't know if that was a conscious decision or not, but who [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  knows? I have a sense. Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=106.04s)]
*  Ask my it's a little low at the beginning. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=108.64s)]
*  Yeah, a ship carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza was attacked by two. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=111.88s)]
*  And I was part of a group who was support supposed to board that boat today to continue [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=118.8s)]
*  the voyage towards Gaza, which which is one of many attempts to open up a humanitarian [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  corridor and to do our part to keep trying to break the Israel's illegal siege on Gaza. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=138.36s)]
*  For two months now, not a single bottle of water has entered Gaza, and it's a systematic [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=157.04s)]
*  starvation of two million people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=166.76s)]
*  And Palestinians have been resisting the. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=170.84s)]
*  Unimaginable oppression for decades and the silence and the passivity, largely from the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  outside world is completely deadly. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=184.67999999999998s)]
*  And we all have a moral responsibility to act against that and to do our part to demand [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  accountability for war criminals and and our own government's complicity in this genocide [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=194.32s)]
*  and illegal occupation and siege. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  Time magazine put her on the cover for that or no, it does not happen this time around. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=206.44s)]
*  Doubtful, doubtful. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  They she's gotten a lot less press coverage since she's been vocal about Palestine's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=212.12s)]
*  weird. It's a couple of things. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=217.56s)]
*  I think it's definitely that's the main thing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  And also a lot of these governments have turned their back on some of the climate [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=220.24s)]
*  commitments that they made during the previous years to Europe backsliding on that thing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  But shame on countries that had previously celebrated this girl who is among the best of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=228.0s)]
*  humanity for all the smears that she's had to endure. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Sweden, her home country, still calling this a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=238.0s)]
*  It's a genocide. You know, why a young girl can be more mature about this than the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=242.12s)]
*  entirety of sort of adulthood in society is infuriating to me. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  When she connected the struggle for climate justice with imperialism, the positive [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=254.68s)]
*  coverage of her outdone disappeared, disappeared. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=260.44s)]
*  And even when she came to this country, to the United States, which she doesn't fly [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=263.84s)]
*  because of her ethical obligation or objections to doing so. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=268.8s)]
*  So she took a solar powered vessel all the way across the Atlantic to get here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=273.08s)]
*  When she came to the US, like there was even uncomfortability with the way she was [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=277.64s)]
*  talking about climate justice, not in like a corporate PR sense, like this, like very [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=281.56s)]
*  anti-capitalist tilt. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=288.64s)]
*  And I think she's her anyway, her activism has been she's doing her best with her [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=290.92s)]
*  platform, but mainstream outlets basically find her too threatening now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=298.0s)]
*  So just to be clear, the flotilla was named Conscience. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=301.68s)]
*  That's the name of the boat. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=307.88s)]
*  It was sailing under the flag of Palau. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=310.28s)]
*  But apparently, according to one of the activists who was en route to the boat, Palau [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=313.72s)]
*  revoked the ship's flag right prior to the attack. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  Because if you get attacked with a country's flag on it, that is considered in [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=330.48s)]
*  international law an act of war. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  And so the absence of the flag makes it easier for Palau not to react to this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=339.96s)]
*  It also the absence of a flag makes it more difficult for the ship to function. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=352.6s)]
*  Palau apparently has pretty close diplomatic ties with Israel and tends to vote with it, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=360.0s)]
*  apparently in the United Nations. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=366.88s)]
*  So. But like the Israel sending a message, there's no doubt that they knew the timing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=368.64000000000004s)]
*  of likely, in my view, her when she was going to board, because this is them trying to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  send a message to any other activists that may be doing an act of civil disobedience [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=385.0s)]
*  or an act that like even puts their life in somewhat in danger by trying to deliver aid [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=390.76000000000005s)]
*  to Gaza despite the blockade. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=395.44s)]
*  They're trying to scare activists. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=397.44s)]
*  Yep. We should also add that today, earlier today, Israel's cabinet approved plans to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=399.0s)]
*  occupy the entire Gaza Strip for an unspecified amount of time. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=413.44s)]
*  They are calling up reservists, I guess. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=421.15999999999997s)]
*  And the idea is that they're probably going to basically displace or whatever internally. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=426.0s)]
*  You know, I don't know if anybody's in place anymore. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=432.88s)]
*  I mean, because everything's been destroyed and supposedly get rid of Hamas. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=436.11999999999995s)]
*  We're now fifty two thousand people killed, at least officially. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=444.64s)]
*  No way. The number is probably much higher than that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=451.84s)]
*  And, you know, who knows how many have died as sort of like a secondary function of having [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  a virtually inoperable society. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=464.68s)]
*  I mean, what's the sum total of Gazans whose life is like permanently? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=467.2s)]
*  With yes. Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=472.72s)]
*  And in October, there was a letter written by 99 American physicians and nurses that [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=474.32s)]
*  said the death toll was at least one hundred and eighteen thousand. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  And the peer reviewed magazine, The Lancet, earlier this year found that the tip, the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=485.32s)]
*  the death toll that cited is likely a 41 percent undercount. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  So. Also, I should say the other day, I guess it was Thursday or Wednesday, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  Netanyahu again reiterated that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=506.79999999999995s)]
*  Where Israel is not going to. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=512.56s)]
*  Leave Gaza, regardless of whether they get the hostages out or not. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=518.76s)]
*  I thought this was all about the hostages. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  It you you would be incorrect. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=526.8s)]
*  So weird. I was taking Israel's explanation at face value. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=530.0s)]
*  They've never lied before. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=535.3199999999999s)]
*  Israel ain't even saying that. Right. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=536.36s)]
*  Sorry. The liberal Zionists in the press here do say that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=539.36s)]
*  I yeah, I took I'm sorry. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=542.8s)]
*  I took Israel's morality at face value. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=544.68s)]
*  Apologies. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=547.0s)]
*  Take phone calls. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=556.52s)]
*  You should check that out. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTzSUFPsnI&t=557.72s)]
