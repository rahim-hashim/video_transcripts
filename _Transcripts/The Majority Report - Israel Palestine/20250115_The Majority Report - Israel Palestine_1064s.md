# Israel-Hamas Ceasefire Deal Cements Biden's Heinous Legacy
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE)
*  It appears that the ceasefire is about to be signed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=0.0s)]
*  People should keep in mind what kind of failure this has been for the Biden administration. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  We have, we've heard now from Jacob Lew, the ambassador to Israel and from the United States. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=11.8s)]
*  Before people start sending me emails like, why aren't you crediting Biden? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=22.78s)]
*  He's been working all night. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=28.04s)]
*  People are saying that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=30.64s)]
*  Well, you'd be surprised who I hear from. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=32.64s)]
*  But if you read this Jacob Lew interview, he was questioned about targeting. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=39.36s)]
*  There are many questions about many incidents after there are after every war. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=43.84s)]
*  There's been a process of internally looking into things that might have gone wrong in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=47.0s)]
*  different places that hasn't been resolved. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=50.0s)]
*  When the secretary says there are still questions to be answered, there are still questions [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=52.56s)]
*  to be answered. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=56.8s)]
*  And the idea of there are still questions to be answered. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=57.86s)]
*  But fundamentally. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=60.06s)]
*  Nothing that we ever said was just stop the war. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=63.42s)]
*  You never heard criticism from the United States for any for Israel carrying out strikes [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=71.86s)]
*  for almost a year in southern Lebanon, attacking Hezbollah and diminishing Hezbollah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=75.9s)]
*  You have not heard a word of criticism from the White House, the State Department, the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=83.14s)]
*  Defense Department, the United States of the operation in Rafa. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=86.66s)]
*  I don't know who he's bragging to. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=90.98s)]
*  We never had an arms embargo, not in May, not since never. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=95.1s)]
*  So just to give you a sense of like he never ever by never ever. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=103.78s)]
*  Utilized any of the leverage that the United States had to get the Israelis to stop the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=110.18s)]
*  stop the attack on Gaza, frankly, for that matter, you know, let in significant and sufficient [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=115.34s)]
*  amounts of aid. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=122.94s)]
*  Never did any of those things. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=124.94s)]
*  Historically precedent of things. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=127.9s)]
*  And now Trump's recent act is the new precedent. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=129.16s)]
*  I mean, I don't know why Israel is stopping the war now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=132.86s)]
*  I am not convinced in the story that that Trump is leveraging this, regardless, that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=141.82s)]
*  will be the narrative. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=147.9s)]
*  And here is Anthony Blinken saying what and this was just well as this was at the Atlantic [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=152.73999999999998s)]
*  Council in D.C. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=163.62s)]
*  When was this? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=166.14s)]
*  Just yesterday. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=167.14s)]
*  If you recall, in December of twenty twenty two, excuse me, twenty twenty three, twenty [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=168.38s)]
*  twenty three, Secretary of Defense Austin gave a speech where he said, like, you know, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=177.66s)]
*  you can you can win the battle and lose the war here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=183.98s)]
*  The idea that you were going to kill all of Hamas and rid Gaza of Hamas by attempting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=188.9s)]
*  to kill all Hamas members was ridiculous from its inception. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=201.1s)]
*  It was ridiculous from its inception because it is the. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=209.14s)]
*  It is a function of the struggle against Israel. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  And any scholar on Hamas knows this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  And any anybody who is, you know, and reporters and scholars about Hamas also know that it [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=227.22s)]
*  was Israel that built up Hamas as a way of undermining any type of Palestinian cohesion. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=233.7s)]
*  It wanted separate entity in the West Bank and a separate entity in Gaza and wanted them [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=240.38s)]
*  to keep Palestinian sovereignty from having any type of political cohesion. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=247.61999999999998s)]
*  But the idea that you can kill tens of thousands of Palestinians, tens of thousands of Palestinian [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=259.1s)]
*  children and not have Hamas regenerate itself, maybe it won't be Hamas. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=267.38s)]
*  They will be post Hamas, but not have a Palestinian independence movement and a violent one grow [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=276.22s)]
*  in its wake is just. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=289.26s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=292.5s)]
*  That's why, you know, you have Israeli historians, Israeli scholars and then obviously [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=295.86s)]
*  non-Israeli ones who and multiple NGOs that say this is a genocide. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=302.38s)]
*  You have former advisors to Netanyahu say it's an ethnic cleansing. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=309.5s)]
*  Take, you know, pick your poison. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=318.1s)]
*  Here is Blinken admitting what people knew all along. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=321.18s)]
*  West Bank is really expanding official settlements and nationalizing land at a faster [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=325.86s)]
*  than any time in the last decade. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  While turning a blind eye to unprecedented growth in the legal outposts, violent attacks [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=336.21999999999997s)]
*  by extremist settlers against Palestinian civilians have reached record levels. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=341.26s)]
*  Positive for a second. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=346.02s)]
*  Incidentally, turning a blind eye, that's an interesting dynamic. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=346.9s)]
*  I know that the US has done some nominal sanctions on these West Bank expansions, but, I mean, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=356.5s)]
*  you should see the other stuff that Israel is doing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=363.9s)]
*  But, God. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=365.7s)]
*  Against Palestinian civilians, every record levels. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=366.97999999999996s)]
*  We've long made the point to the Israeli government that Hamas cannot be defeated by a military [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=371.73999999999995s)]
*  campaign alone, that without a clear alternative, a post-conflict plan and a credible political [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=376.06s)]
*  rise of the Palestinians, Hamas or something just as important and dangerous will grow back. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=381.7s)]
*  That's exactly what's happened more than once since October 7th. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=389.17999999999995s)]
*  Each time Israel completes its military operations and pulls back, Hamas bill is to regroup and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=392.5s)]
*  reemerge because there's nothing else to fill the void. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=398.5s)]
*  Indeed, we assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=402.06s)]
*  That is a recipe for enduring insurgency and perpetual war. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=408.53999999999996s)]
*  Wow, that's shocking. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=414.94s)]
*  What? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=416.1s)]
*  So, in other words, you have destroyed every, almost every hospital in Gaza. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=418.34s)]
*  You have destroyed every university, nearly every school. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=426.38s)]
*  You have shattered the lives of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, a million children. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=432.46s)]
*  You have left thousands of orphans. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=442.34s)]
*  You have killed off entire bloodlines and families. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=446.41999999999996s)]
*  You have turned Gaza into dust and rubble. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=452.61999999999995s)]
*  I mean, this is something that, you know, what child of the million plus children there [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=460.58s)]
*  of the million plus children there in Gaza. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=468.02s)]
*  Their lives are not going to be completely dictated by this their entire lives. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=473.94s)]
*  And. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=480.34s)]
*  You have not essentially changed the number of Hamas fighters there are. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=483.97999999999996s)]
*  You've killed some of your own hostages. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=491.74s)]
*  And the only thing you've accomplished is killing probably at a minimum, a hundred, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=496.06s)]
*  hundred and fifty thousand Palestinians ruin the lives of four times that many, five times [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=505.62s)]
*  that many caused billions of dollars worth of destruction. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=514.58s)]
*  And for what? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=522.86s)]
*  For what? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=525.9s)]
*  Zero, zero, zero gain, all destruction. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=528.98s)]
*  I mean, it's like a five times that many. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=539.58s)]
*  It's like, I mean, it's like a fetish. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=542.1s)]
*  Just horrible. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=548.0600000000001s)]
*  Here's Chris Hayes. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=549.66s)]
*  I don't know if we should play all this. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=550.94s)]
*  It's long, but good for him. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=552.54s)]
*  Last Friday night on MSNBC talking about how Biden's legacy is disgraceful because of this. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=555.54s)]
*  Since the end of the last World War, there have been basically two kind of competing [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=568.02s)]
*  visions of America's role in the world, at least among the two major parties. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=572.22s)]
*  There's an international liberal international view, right? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=576.34s)]
*  That the human rights should matter, that there should be a uniform standard globally [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=579.3s)]
*  that applies to every nation, including us, the US and our allies, a regime of international [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=582.98s)]
*  norms and most importantly, international law, like real international law, that the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=588.42s)]
*  US could shape and strengthen. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=591.74s)]
*  Now, to be clear, I wasn't born yesterday. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=593.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm not born in the US. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=595.9399999999999s)]
*  I wasn't born here. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=596.82s)]
*  I wasn't born yesterday. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=597.82s)]
*  I'm not completely naive. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=598.82s)]
*  Yes, that standard is one that is very, very often only given lip service to while the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=599.82s)]
*  US pursues pure power politics. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=604.6600000000001s)]
*  But it is a meaningful and important standard, as is the aspiration towards reaching it and [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=608.62s)]
*  the people that advocate holding it as a standard. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=613.1400000000001s)]
*  So that's one vision. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=615.7s)]
*  And then there's a kind of standard reactionary vision, right wing vision, which is that might [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=617.4200000000001s)]
*  makes right. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=622.3000000000001s)]
*  Norms are fictions that can never really constrain us. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=623.98s)]
*  We're the greatest country on earth. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=626.3s)]
*  And because we are the greatest nation, it's just definitionally impossible for us or our [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=627.5s)]
*  allies to be on the wrong side of international law, which doesn't exist. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=632.06s)]
*  And that view is strong and has a very long tradition. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=636.22s)]
*  You can say it might have peaked or reached its apogee in the Cold War under Henry Kissinger, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=639.5s)]

*  policy in the last 60 years. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=672.86s)]
*  And now Salvador, where US back forces fueled a civil war and murdered Catholic bishops, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=676.22s)]
*  Catholic nuns and social workers, an outrage that led the Carter administration to suspend [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=682.46s)]
*  military aid to the nation. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=687.6600000000001s)]
*  And as the Cold War finally wound down, there was one lawmaker who made an indelible contribution [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=690.3000000000001s)]
*  to rolling back these abuses and attempting, again, attempting to set a standard for American [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=695.46s)]

*  That was Senator Pat Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, in 1997. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=706.06s)]
*  So called Leahy Law expands our current law and seeks to ensure the United States assistance [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=710.9799999999999s)]

*  that in our efforts to support foreign security forces that we respect human rights, we also [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=725.3s)]
*  prevent those who abuse human rights from receiving our assistance. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=730.9399999999999s)]
*  And straightforward, Leahy Law barred the Pentagon and the Department of State from [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=735.4200000000001s)]
*  transferring US arms to countries that we thought were committing human rights abuses. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=738.98s)]
*  And that is what I keep thinking of as I process the news that on the way out the door, the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=744.02s)]
*  Biden administration is going to transfer eight billion dollars more in weapons to Israel, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=748.98s)]

*  Eight million dollars in weaponry given over to an ally waging what I think can only be [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=760.1s)]
*  described as total war in Gaza that has, according to I think multiple independent [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=764.58s)]
*  experts and reports, reporters and NGOs been committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=770.0200000000001s)]
*  according to a former Israeli defense minister where Israeli soldiers say they have been [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=776.26s)]
*  ordered to target and kill innocents arbitrarily, including children, and that they have used [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=781.74s)]
*  Palestinians as human shields for their operations in Gaza. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=787.26s)]
*  As whistleblowers and detainees say, the Israeli authorities regularly torture Palestinian [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=791.46s)]
*  prisoners. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=796.98s)]
*  The UN says Israel is using starvation as a strategy in Gaza. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=798.26s)]
*  Amnesty International says Israel is committing a genocide. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=802.62s)]
*  Dozens of doctors, nurses and paramedics who volunteered in Gaza and were there and saw [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=807.3000000000001s)]
*  up close told the New York Times they'd seen, as you see the images there in front of you, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=812.34s)]
*  multiple children who were shot in the head or chest, in the head or chest, bullets. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=818.62s)]
*  And they even brought back the x-rays you're seeing right now to prove it so people would [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=825.66s)]
*  believe that they had seen children with bullets lodged in their skulls. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=829.6999999999999s)]
*  As Congresswoman Katie Porter pointed out in a House hearing last year, the US ban on [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=835.4599999999999s)]
*  arms transfers to human rights abusers, the Lady Law, has one big exception. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=838.9s)]
*  The United Department says that aid should stop immediately if there's a problem, does it? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=845.18s)]
*  It totally depends on the circumstances and situation. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=852.8599999999999s)]
*  Does it depend on the country that's getting the aid? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=854.9399999999999s)]
*  It also depends on the country receiving the aid, yes. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=856.78s)]
*  So what country does aid not stop immediately under Leahy? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=859.2199999999999s)]
*  I'd have to go back and look through my notes. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=864.42s)]
*  You don't know what country that is? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=866.18s)]
*  It's only one in the entire world. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=868.0999999999999s)]
*  Except for Israel. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=870.98s)]
*  Even now, former Senator Pat Leahy, who is no longer in the Senate, says Israel is getting [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=879.7s)]
*  a pass in violation of the spirit, if not the letter of the law, that he'll pass. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=884.14s)]
*  Beginning in the early 2000s, I wrote to successive secretaries of state about the failure to [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=888.4200000000001s)]
*  apply the Leahy Law to Israel. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=892.22s)]
*  Their responses were either inconclusive or inaccurately claimed the law was being applied [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=894.38s)]
*  to Israel the same as to other countries, which the State Department continues to insist [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=898.02s)]
*  today. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=902.5799999999999s)]
*  Leahy added, the State Department's dismissive response not only beggars credulity, it also [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=904.14s)]
*  makes a mockery of the law. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=908.02s)]
*  This is Pat Leahy, a liberal senator, not a radical, right? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=910.46s)]
*  Not a fringe voice in American politics. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=915.18s)]
*  Someone who knows this issue, who spent decades working on this issue, and not just about [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=917.66s)]
*  Israel, but all kinds of American allies. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=921.34s)]
*  And yet here we are. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=925.78s)]
*  President Biden is going to hand a blank check for Israel over to the incoming Trump administration. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=928.86s)]
*  I don't think it's coincidental that yesterday on Capitol Hill, the House overwhelmingly [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=933.8199999999999s)]
*  passed a bill to sanction officers of the International Criminal Court to punish them [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=938.02s)]
*  for moving to charge top Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=942.9s)]
*  with war crimes. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=947.38s)]
*  Keep in mind, the ICC also indicted leaders of Hamas for their war crimes appropriately. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=948.38s)]
*  And their holding of Israeli hostages, which continues to this very day. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=955.3s)]
*  And 45 Democrats joined all Republicans to support this bill. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=960.74s)]
*  We know which vision of American global engagement the Trump administration will carry out. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=965.34s)]
*  But it isn't just Trump who this week is making an absolute mockery of every last lecture [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=971.38s)]
*  we deliver to the Russians or the Chinese or anyone else about respecting human rights [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=975.78s)]
*  and international law. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=981.22s)]
*  It is President Joe Biden to leaving a disgraceful legacy. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=982.3000000000001s)]
*  A liberal president doing untold damage to the liberal international order. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=988.62s)]
*  That was about as good as you're going to see on national television. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=997.58s)]
*  Another way to put that is in Foreign Policy magazine in November. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=1003.02s)]
*  Noam Chomsky has been proved right. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=1007.4200000000001s)]
*  All that stuff was fluff. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=1010.1800000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=1012.7s)]
*  Let me know on Twitter, Blue Sky, if you see actual Dem politicians express anger about this. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=1019.94s)]
*  I'm seeing some media and it's nice of 60 minutes to dust off some footage they've had [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=1024.94s)]
*  for eight months to talk about it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=1029.02s)]
*  But I'd like to see some- About the Leahy law. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=1030.38s)]
*  About Biden and not pushing Israel to stop this before the election. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=1032.1000000000001s)]
*  I'd like to see some electeds or some higher up people start some recrimination a little [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=1036.74s)]
*  bit. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=1042.18s)]
*  It's shocking to me that there's not any of that. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N4lGbv-ULE&t=1043.18s)]
