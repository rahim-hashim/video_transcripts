# Has Israel Already Lost? | David Hearst | TMR
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM)
*  We are back and we are joined now by David Hearst, co-founder and editor in chief of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=0.0s)]
*  Middle East Eye, his recent piece for Middle East Eye is entitled, Israel Has Already Lost [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=4.44s)]
*  the Gaza War. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=8.78s)]
*  It Just Doesn't Know It Yet. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=9.78s)]
*  David, thanks so much for coming on the show today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=10.78s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=13.32s)]
*  So I almost want to start with where your piece ends with this sentence, Israel may [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=14.8s)]
*  win each battle as the Americans did in Vietnam, but it will lose the war. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=20.6s)]
*  Can we work back from there? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=26.46s)]
*  What brings you to that hypothesis based on what we've seen of, you know, a year and a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=27.76s)]
*  half of genocide at this point? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=33.56s)]
*  Well, it's not an original thought. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=35.2s)]
*  It's been said by quite a few people who have actually fought quite hard on Israel's behalf, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  not least its former Mossad chief. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=44.44s)]
*  It is the feeling that they win every battle because technologically they're just so much [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=49.88s)]
*  superior to the Palestinians and what the Palestinians can reply. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=56.92s)]
*  But that there are two things that Israel is not under Israel's control. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=63.28s)]
*  It can't crush the Palestinian spirit or as the Palestinians would say, the Palestinian [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  resistance, which could be violent or nonviolent. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  And the more it tries to to basically kill, the more it's actually hitting a civilian [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=78.72s)]
*  population and just generating another generation of fighters in 10, 20 years time, which is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=85.76s)]
*  exactly who is fighting this war right now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=92.56s)]
*  If you think of the generation that's fighting this war, this is a post Oslo generation that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=95.24s)]
*  has seen no progress since Oslo in its in in their own national aspirations, and some [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  have sold their taxes for guns and I've interviewed them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  The other thing that is that has changed in this war is international opinion. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=114.52s)]
*  And that's where the parallel with Vietnam comes in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=120.0s)]
*  You know, in fact, if you go back, LBJ was told by the CIA in 1967 that there was a stalemate [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  with the Viet Cong, but it took seven more years to actually pull out and another president [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=129.68s)]
*  under Nixon to pull out of Vietnam. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=136.68s)]
*  Here what we have is a quite rapidly deteriorating situation of Israel's image internationally. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=142.0s)]
*  And I think there is a marked change of tone now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  You know, 18 months on, I mean, for me, everything that Israel has been criticized of today could [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=154.08s)]
*  have been said in October or November 2023. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=162.84s)]
*  But the fact that it's being said now is, I think, interesting. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=166.72000000000003s)]
*  What do you make of that then? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=172.16000000000003s)]
*  Is it the the what what do you make of the change in kind of liberal posture towards [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=174.28s)]
*  this? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=182.28s)]
*  And we can expand outside of the United States here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=182.8s)]
*  The European Union, I know, said, I guess, two days ago that they're reviewing their [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=186.52s)]
*  political agreements with Israel. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=191.88s)]
*  You see the prime minister in the UK with a little bit more of a chiding tone towards [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=195.0s)]
*  the Israelis. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Where do you see that shift having happened? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=203.84s)]
*  Yeah, there's also a joint statement of condemnation by Britain, France and Canada. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=206.28s)]
*  And that could lead to an early recognition of the state of Palestine by all three countries [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  in the not too distant future. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  Now, I don't know. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=218.96s)]
*  I just don't know what has led to this, because for someone like me that's been covering this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  and covering every death, not me personally, my website, you know, every doctor killed, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=226.8s)]
*  every hospital destroyed, every child star to death. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=234.28s)]
*  You can say, why now? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=237.32000000000002s)]
*  You know, what's actually changed? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  Is it statements about mass starvation coming from the UN? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=240.96s)]
*  Is it because Israel has only today allowed 90 trucks in after, I think, 11 weeks of total [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  blockade? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  Was it the clumsy attempt to cover up the killings of the those Red Crescent first responders [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=251.24s)]
*  in Ra'afah? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=256.24s)]
*  Is it the fear that when the International Court of Justice actually comes to a ruling [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=257.88s)]
*  on genocide, every leader, every leader that allowed Israel's campaign to continue under [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=262.64000000000004s)]
*  a spurious banner of a right to defend itself could be regarded in law as an enabler of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=267.64000000000004s)]
*  genocide? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  Or is it lip gloss, another form of cover? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=273.16s)]
*  Now, the cynical, the cynical me says it's the latter because hours after the British [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=276.12s)]
*  Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced sanctions on Israel, an RAF plane took off from a British [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  base of Akrotiri in Cyprus to conduct a surveillance mission over Gaza. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=286.8s)]
*  Lammy is not suspending arms supplies or parts of drones or parts for the F-35s. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  So and only weeks before, Lammy met his counterpart, Gideon Saar, Israeli Foreign Minister, in [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=299.0s)]
*  what was called a private visit. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=305.6s)]
*  And yet Saar is a key member of the cabinet that collectively stopped all food going into [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=307.12s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=312.24s)]
*  So you could say this is just to cover, cover a very shaky position. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=313.64s)]
*  But that said, I think the cumulative effect on Israel will be real diplomatically. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=322.16s)]
*  You mentioned the Oslo process. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  Can you take us back a little bit into that history and explain to people what, how that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=331.04s)]
*  more pro-Israel agreement than is traditionally written about in the West aided and abetted, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=339.8s)]
*  I guess, the choking off of potential diplomacy in the aftermath of it and increase the level [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=349.52s)]
*  of, I guess, impunity that Israel has experienced in the decades since? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=360.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, Paul, just going into that thing, that there's something very, very concrete that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=368.44s)]
*  Oslo allowed. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  Oslo allowed the biggest wave of settlement of the West Bank in the history of the conflict. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=373.20000000000005s)]
*  And so you had peace and you had this massive and sudden wave of settlers turning up in [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=381.08000000000004s)]
*  the West Bank. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=386.72s)]
*  I forget the numbers, but if you go back over the figures, it's very clear that I think [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=387.72s)]
*  Oslo produced for Israel something like 325,000 settlers that hadn't been there before. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  So that's what was a gain for the concept of greater Israel, because you've got to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=400.24s)]
*  remember that Israel is not terribly interested in Gaza biblically or historically or ideologically [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=404.56s)]
*  or religiously. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=410.76s)]
*  It is far more interested in the West Bank, which continues to call Judea and Samaria. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=411.76s)]
*  What Oslo did was provide a process that never came to anything for the Palestinians, but [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=419.32s)]
*  provided concrete gains for the Israelis. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  As I've already mentioned, but it also provided this paradigm, this myth that if only the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=428.92s)]
*  Palestinians got themselves together, they had the right leadership. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=436.0s)]
*  If only there was the right alignment of stars with the Israeli public, you'd have a Palestinian [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=439.72s)]
*  state, which of course never, ever happened. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=445.72s)]
*  And all of that has come, the basis of what I would call the Friends of Israel or liberal [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=449.32s)]
*  Zionism, the idea, the belief in a homeland for the Jews that could enable, that was an [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=457.56s)]
*  Israel for all its citizens, that could also enable a Palestinian state to be born in a [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=466.16s)]
*  two-state solution. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=471.64s)]
*  That has very much crumbled in Benjamin Netanyahu's hands. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=473.12s)]
*  And he has really set himself a life's mission of preventing stifling a Palestinian state [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=477.82s)]
*  at birth. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=485.12s)]
*  That is what he will go down in history for, and that is what he's proudest of. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=486.12s)]
*  And he says it openly now. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=493.12s)]
*  And in fact, on the question of a Palestinian state, this is the one issue in a very, very [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=497.92s)]
*  divided Israel, which has people, Israelis say, a civil war boiling between liberals [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=502.92s)]
*  and hardliners on the judicial front. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=510.04s)]
*  That's one point of agreement. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=514.52s)]
*  There are votes in the Knesset, which are near 100% votes on the question of whether [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=517.48s)]
*  a Palestinian state should ever be allowed to be born. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  There's complete consensus on the Palestinian question between the so-called opponents of [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu and Netanyahu himself. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=536.84s)]
*  And I think- [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=540.24s)]
*  And that answer is no. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=541.24s)]
*  That answer is no. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=542.24s)]
*  Yeah, basically the answer is no. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=544.0s)]
*  And I think the international community have yet to catch up with the reality that a two-state [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=545.32s)]
*  solution was something that could have happened with the Arab Peace Initiative in 2002, the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=551.12s)]
*  Saudi Arabian plan. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=556.72s)]
*  But that train has left the station. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=558.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=561.24s)]
*  I mean, there was, I think, some polling out of the University of Tel Aviv that shows that [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=562.24s)]
*  an overwhelming majority of Israelis support Donald Trump's ethnic cleansing plan for Gaza. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=570.88s)]
*  So the scope of what is liberal and what is conservative thought within Israel is quite [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=576.2s)]
*  different than I think a lot of Westerners would like to imagine or what we've been told [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  about what political consensus is in Israel. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=589.9200000000001s)]
*  The part that's just so striking to me is we've been having conversations about how [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=595.04s)]
*  Biden's foreign policy was so disastrous in part because he had this very archaic commitment [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=604.48s)]
*  to the post-World War II system of alliances and not speaking to enemies, but building [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  up NATO, building up AUKUS, and not necessarily being hawkish with China, not re-engaging [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=620.48s)]
*  in the Iran nuclear deal, which was Obama's arguably greatest foreign policy achievement [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=630.72s)]
*  during that time period. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=636.9599999999999s)]
*  You have Trump come in, right? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=639.36s)]
*  And he's breaking down the traditional liberal foreign policy orthodoxy, eschewing liberal [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=640.72s)]
*  interventionism and saying this is a failed strategy, which he's right about, but then at [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=646.72s)]
*  the same time, it just feels like that is just about enriching himself, right? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=653.52s)]
*  So I'm grateful to see this kind of change in this national security pattern and orthodoxy [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=658.64s)]
*  and this death spiral that we've all been watching. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=668.88s)]
*  But if it's not paired with a policy of restraining Israel, then I guess is there a benefit just [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=672.48s)]
*  purely to breaking up this orthodoxy or this way of thinking? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=680.72s)]
*  Because it just seems like Trump is mostly only interested in corruption here. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=684.48s)]
*  Well, I think that's a very, very good point. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=689.12s)]
*  And I can't really answer it in a short form. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=690.88s)]
*  I mean, I think Biden's foreign policy collapsed under the weight of what was going on in Gaza. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=695.2s)]
*  I think he had levers and he had room to conduct liberal interventionism and continue to conduct [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=707.52s)]
*  that classic set of foreign policy, which failed in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=716.32s)]
*  Syria and Russia when I was in Russia in the 1990s. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=723.28s)]
*  That was a form of liberal interventionism completely collapsed to produce Putin. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=729.52s)]
*  But he still had the opportunity or the wheel room within that failed policy of applying a [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=736.0s)]
*  lot, lot more pressure on Netanyahu, principally by cutting off the arms and saying so. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=741.6s)]
*  But Netanyahu knew he never would. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu has got a very, very clear reading of what's going on in Capitol Hill. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=749.2s)]
*  And he's always had an iron grip on analysis of just how weak the Democrats are [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=756.72s)]
*  and how he can manipulate the Republicans. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=763.92s)]
*  And it could now be paradoxically that Trump, who's only interested in his pocket and where [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=768.88s)]
*  the next golf course is going and his next visit to the Queen and how much money he's [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=775.28s)]
*  loading up in his personal coffers, complete corruption, could actually prove more of a [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=782.3199999999999s)]
*  problem to Netanyahu than Biden could because he only thinks in transactional terms about, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=788.4s)]
*  doesn't think of good or evil, doesn't care a damn about the Palestinians. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=796.9599999999999s)]
*  And his plan is to create a larger ethnic cleansing, three times larger, in fact, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=800.8s)]
*  of Palestinians than actually happened in 1948. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=809.04s)]
*  And considering that all of this conflict arises from that one single event in 1948, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=811.6800000000001s)]
*  how much more conflict are we storing up for ourselves generally? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=817.84s)]
*  Even if you smash Hamas, smash Hezbollah, even if the whole place goes quiet and the whole place [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=820.96s)]
*  falls under Israeli military control and everything's quiet, you're going to store up [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=829.44s)]
*  a huge explosion in 10, 20 years down the line. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=835.04s)]
*  So it is so imperative now that we change our thinking about Israel, that Democrats change [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=840.24s)]
*  their thinking about Israel, that progressives change their thinking about Israel. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=847.52s)]
*  And it's so imperative, I think, that we have a clear-sighted view of actually [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=851.44s)]
*  which country we're supporting. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=857.2800000000001s)]
*  When we say we're a friend of Israel, what sort of Israel? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=858.48s)]
*  Are we a friend of apartheid? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=860.6400000000001s)]
*  Are we a friend of genocide? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=862.32s)]
*  Are we a friend of ethnic cleansing? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=863.84s)]
*  Of course we're not. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=865.44s)]
*  And we've got to stop thinking of Israel in these sort of idealized terms of a country [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=866.48s)]
*  that is genuinely good but is just being overtaken, has just been seized by the wrong sort of people. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=872.0s)]
*  It's not that anymore. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=878.96s)]
*  And there has to be a rethinking of the West's relationship with Israel. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=880.8000000000001s)]
*  Whatever happens to the Palestinians in Gaza, whatever happens to Hamas? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=886.9599999999999s)]
*  I hadn't planned on playing this for you, but you brought me here because when we're [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=893.28s)]
*  just speaking about how the Democrats need to kind of have a reckoning with liberal Zionism [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=898.48s)]
*  and with support for Israel, there is a fork in the road and you have even, it's not just [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=906.16s)]
*  members of the squad in the House or the more progressive members like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=914.08s)]
*  Anil Han-Omar, Rashida Tlaib. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=919.2800000000001s)]
*  Some senators like Chris Van Hollen, who you wouldn't have said is going to be an advocate [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=921.76s)]
*  for Palestinians, he's diverged from his own leader in the Senate, who I like to call here [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=927.9200000000001s)]
*  Mr. 17% approval rating, Chuck Schumer. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=934.32s)]
*  This is from a little while ago, but this is how he speaks about Israel. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=937.44s)]
*  And you've done decades of reporting in the Middle East. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=942.0s)]
*  This is almost indistinguishable from how every Republican speaks about both the United Nations [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=946.24s)]
*  and international aid organizations. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=951.52s)]
*  This is under a minute, but I'd love your response here, David. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=953.36s)]
*  So yes, it's very emotional and to almost all Jewish people, we all have relatives and we know [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=957.84s)]
*  about this has happened. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=965.04s)]
*  Again, genocide is a vicious, vicious word to use. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=966.96s)]
*  I will say it's a word that a UN special committee has used. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=972.56s)]
*  Please, the UN has been anti-Israel, anti-Semitically against Israel, double standard. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=976.8s)]
*  Moynihan was my idol. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=984.56s)]
*  He became famous when in 1976 they tried to pass a resolution, Zionism is racism. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=985.84s)]
*  To say that the Jewish people should not have a state when every other people should have a state [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=992.88s)]
*  is anti-Semitism, the old double standard, ipso facto. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=998.88s)]
*  And the international organizations, I have no faith in them being fair. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1004.0s)]
*  These same international organizations, when horrible things go in in Darfur or China or [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1007.68s)]
*  whether they look the other way. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1012.32s)]
*  That's actually the opposite of the truth. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1016.08s)]
*  These international organizations and the United Nations are western in their construction, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1018.0s)]
*  by definition. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1023.52s)]
*  The criticism of the ICC, for example, has been that they basically will prosecute warlords or [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1025.5200000000002s)]
*  leaders in poorer countries that the United States has problems with and doesn't go after [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1032.3200000000002s)]
*  the people most aligned with the West when they commit human rights atrocities. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1038.8000000000002s)]
*  But the ICC had no choice in the case of Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1045.1200000000001s)]
*  In response, the United States is sanctioning the International Criminal Court. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1050.16s)]
*  There's just your response to that, David, because it sounds like every Republican. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1055.3600000000001s)]
*  This is a leading Democrat politician arguing against a rules-based world order. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1060.4s)]
*  It's a Democrat arguing against the ICC. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1070.0s)]
*  This is a Democrat arguing against the rule of law. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1073.68s)]
*  Would he have said the same thing about Putin, which the ICC sanctioned within months of the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1077.2s)]
*  attack on Ukraine? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1083.12s)]
*  This is unbelievable. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1085.52s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1088.32s)]
*  I'm not surprised by that. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1090.8799999999999s)]
*  I've heard that clip before. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1092.0s)]
*  I'm not suddenly waking up to it. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1094.7199999999998s)]
*  But this is a really prime-faceted example of how that whole system of liberal Zionism [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1096.56s)]
*  is undermining itself. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1104.08s)]
*  He said many, many claims there, which were all very, very mixed up, all about [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1104.9599999999998s)]
*  Jews' right to a homeland, which is Balfour. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1109.68s)]
*  We're not talking about Jewish right to a homeland. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1114.88s)]
*  We're talking about the Palestinian right to a homeland as well. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1116.96s)]
*  We're not talking about the right of Jewish self-determination. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1120.0800000000002s)]
*  I come from a family of Jewish refugees from Vienna. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1125.1200000000001s)]

*  Others went. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1134.0800000000002s)]
*  To link what has happened to all Jews, the suffering of all Jews, to what's happening [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1135.12s)]
*  in Israel is exactly what Israel does. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1142.32s)]
*  And as someone who is Jewish, I'm uniquely offended by that. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1144.96s)]
*  I have to stop frothing at the mouth almost because I know that's not the case. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1149.12s)]
*  I know it's not true. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1155.84s)]
*  I know that Israel does not stand for all Jews. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1157.6s)]

*  They are at the forefront of demonstrations against Gaza. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1170.32s)]

*  I'm afraid Chuck Schumer has put himself into the dustbin of history. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1177.04s)]
*  He's put himself in many ways an honorable man on many other issues, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1182.8799999999999s)]
*  but he's put himself on Israel literally on the wrong side. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1188.24s)]
*  He's justifying whether you call it genocide. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1194.0s)]
*  I'm not an international lawyer, but an awful lot of lawyers seem to think that's a word [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1198.16s)]
*  that can only be used. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1202.72s)]
*  But we cannot have a situation and we cannot tolerate a situation where one [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1204.56s)]
*  politician after another, one generation of politician after another, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1209.76s)]
*  says those sorts of things. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1213.2s)]
*  And in so doing divides, a genocide occurred in Srebrenica, a genocide is occurring in Sudan, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1215.44s)]
*  but it cannot happen by Israeli, at the hands of Israeli troops. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1224.48s)]
*  When there's the evidence that Gaza war is unlike Vietnam, the most filmed and documented war ever. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1230.16s)]
*  And the evidence of that, even from the mouths of Israeli politicians, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1239.28s)]

*  of killing babies. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1254.24s)]
*  If anyone else said that, you would call that anti-Semitic or blood libel. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1256.0s)]
*  This is an Israeli politician saying this. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1260.1599999999999s)]
*  So I think that clip shows you very, very clearly what has to change within the Democrat party, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1262.08s)]
*  and to change for the side of fairness, for the side of decency, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1268.96s)]
*  and also for the sake of Israelis and also for the sake of Jews around the world, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1273.28s)]
*  because that sort of performance has to stop. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1277.6s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you mentioned Vietnam. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1281.28s)]
*  Gaza's 141 square miles. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1284.32s)]
*  You wrote this in your piece. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1287.2s)]
*  In the span of eight years, the US dropped more than five million tons of bombs in Vietnam, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1288.3999999999999s)]
*  making it the most bombed place on earth. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1292.8s)]
*  By January of this year, Israel has dropped at least 100,000 tons of bombs on Gaza. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1294.8799999999999s)]
*  I just want to repeat that. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1303.84s)]
*  In the span of eight years, the US dropped five million tons of bombs on Vietnam, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1305.28s)]
*  a much larger swath of territory than 140 odd square miles. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1309.52s)]
*  100,000 tons of bombs on Gaza. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1316.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1320.96s)]
*  And yeah, go ahead, David. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1321.28s)]
*  I mean, in terms of historical patterns, that is as a comparison of per square mile. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1323.52s)]
*  Per square mile, it works out at something like 18 times as many bombs. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1327.84s)]
*  But in terms of historical bombings that have horrified the world since, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1332.8s)]
*  there's a massive amount of work done on the bombing of Dresden and the bombing of Hamburg, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1339.12s)]
*  whether that was a war crime or not by the RAF and the fire bombing that took place. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1347.44s)]
*  It turns out that if you compare the amount of bombs dropped on, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1354.48s)]
*  American bombs generally dropped on Gaza, that is more than was dropped on Hamburg and Dresden [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1360.0s)]
*  and Coventry in the whatever it is, seven years of the World War II. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1369.4399999999998s)]
*  And that was within two or three months. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1378.08s)]
*  So it was an immense, so, you know, we talk about Biden's weakness. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1379.4399999999998s)]
*  What actually happened was that Biden sanctioned this enormous dropping of American bombs. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1383.28s)]
*  This could not have been possible before. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1388.56s)]
*  And I don't make that claim sort of loosely or lightly. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1390.48s)]
*  There was an Israeli general, I forget now whom, who said an Air Force officer who said, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1394.1599999999999s)]
*  had America not resupplied us with those 2000 pound bombs, within two, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1399.28s)]
*  we would have had to stop bombing Gaza within two months. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1405.2s)]
*  So there are two elements to this war. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1408.8799999999999s)]
*  One is the total nature of it triggered by the Hamas attack. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1410.56s)]
*  And the other is the length of time it has been permitted to go on. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1417.44s)]
*  I mean, Blair, Blair, thought Blair, but he was one of the leaders who stopped [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1420.8s)]
*  an early incursion into Gaza and just, you know, after 44 days and said, right, enough already. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  That's it, finished. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1433.6s)]
*  But that hasn't happened. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1434.8s)]
*  And so Israel has behaved and Netanyahu has behaved in a way that is completely predictable [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1436.24s)]
*  with his alliances and with what he says. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1443.3600000000001s)]
*  What is I couldn't have predicted in October 2023 is how long the West, America, Britain, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1445.76s)]
*  France would have tolerated this. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1454.48s)]
*  Now they're coming to the end of it. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1456.5600000000002s)]
*  But why has it taken so long and so many deaths to do so? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1458.3200000000002s)]
*  And to wrap up with you, David, you also write about how the despite [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1463.0400000000002s)]
*  kind of some lip service from Mohammed bin Salman and other leaders in the in the neighboring [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1470.16s)]
*  countries, they're doing these deals with Donald Trump, these financial deals with him [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1477.8400000000001s)]
*  without really meaningfully addressing Palestinian plight. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1486.0s)]
*  You know, there's like a political situation for these undemocratic leaders in the Middle East, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1490.96s)]
*  which, by the way, the United States props up because it's much more streamlined if we can [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1497.84s)]
*  give military aid to these monarchs, essentially, than, you know, actually encouraging democracy [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1502.56s)]
*  in the Middle East, which is just it's just so crazy how opposite of the truth it is. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1510.8799999999999s)]
*  But what is the complicity of these leaders in the region who have basically [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1516.8799999999999s)]
*  publicly supported Palestinians, but have privately been more than happy to kind of [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1526.88s)]
*  do deals both with Israel and the United States because that's where the money is? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1532.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think there are two things that one, they represent a new generation of autocrat. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1536.4s)]
*  Their fathers had the Palestinian issue, you know, stamped on their brow. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1541.28s)]
*  This generation has, you know, YouTube and, you know, TikTok stamped on their brow. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1546.0800000000002s)]
*  They're not interested and they don't regard the Palestinian issue as remotely [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1553.6s)]
*  theirs. They're interested in making money and they think that, and, you know, they calculate that, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1560.8799999999999s)]
*  in fact, a so-called normalization with Israel is the route to Washington's heart. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1570.6399999999999s)]
*  And so they use this strategy. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1576.72s)]
*  Mohammed bin Zayed, who's the president of the United Emirates, introduced a young and [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1580.0s)]
*  unknown prince who was then called Mohammed bin Salman to the Trump clan, you know, before [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1587.6000000000001s)]
*  Trump's first term, basically through Israel. Bin Salman visited Netanyahu several times secretly [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1598.48s)]
*  and courted pro-Israeli opinion in America by saying he personally didn't give a damn what [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1611.3600000000001s)]
*  happens to the Palestinians. And that was very, very much the formula of the Abraham Accords, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1618.0s)]
*  which was to sort of pave over, cement over the Palestinian problem and use Palestinians as sort [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1625.76s)]
*  of gas darbiter, you know, as foreign workers across the Arab world. I mean, the tragedy of [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1632.64s)]
*  the Palestinian conflict has always been that Arab rulers have sold them down the river. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1640.64s)]
*  And they're doing the same thing now. They managed to turn temporarily [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1647.44s)]
*  the policy on bombing Yemen. That has stopped, which is a good thing. And they turned [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1656.32s)]
*  and they persuaded Trump not to assassinate Ahmed Sharah, who's the new leader of Syria, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1664.32s)]
*  that Israel definitely wants to depose and divide into three, but to support him and remove sanctions, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1671.36s)]
*  although whether the sanctions will actually be removed is a different matter. It takes a long [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1679.44s)]
*  time to do that. But not a word about Palestine. And I think it's a day of shame for the Arab leaders [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1685.36s)]
*  because quite apart from anything else, forget, forget humanity or forget moral principles. If [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1694.9599999999998s)]
*  you have two million Palestinians floating around the space having been ejected from [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1701.76s)]
*  Palestine, they'll go anywhere and they will disrupt the stability of any of their, you know, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1709.52s)]
*  polite little rich states because there will be a force of destabilization. And that is about the [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1718.0s)]
*  last thing these rulers want. I mean, the real problem, one last comment, the real problem about [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1727.6000000000001s)]
*  normalization is this is a deal, as you said, between a deeply dubious Israeli leadership [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1733.52s)]
*  or ideologically motivated right wing Israeli leadership that wants to recreate the borders of [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1742.3999999999999s)]
*  greater Israel and people with almost no legitimacy, people who are rulers simply because [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1748.08s)]
*  they are the sons of other rulers. And what they fear through normalizing with Israel is a revolt [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1757.3600000000001s)]
*  of their own population because and Mohammed bin Salman has actually admitted this. He said, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1766.32s)]
*  I couldn't sign a normalization deal with Israel. Otherwise I might meet the same fate as Anwar Sadat [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1772.4s)]
*  who was shot. And it's true. And you would meet the same fate. That's true. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1779.28s)]
*  Right. But then that's but that's what you're the conclusion of what you're saying is, is that [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1785.68s)]
*  if Israel is only accepting an ethnic cleansing plan for the Palestinians and these Arab rulers [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1791.84s)]
*  are doing this secretly because they're fearful of the backlash with their population, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1801.92s)]
*  but they don't want to take on millions of Palestinian refugees to absorb them into their [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1806.24s)]
*  country, that it feels like a handshake agreement for genocide then. Yes, it is. It is. And the only [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1811.84s)]
*  thing stopping genocide or the major thing stopping genocide is the determination of Palestinians. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1818.48s)]
*  And I've met who say I would rather die on my land than leave. And if you go around the West Bank, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1823.52s)]
*  where they're being ejected from their farms on hillsides in South Hebron and they're not Hamas, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1832.16s)]
*  that they haven't got a gun there and they're facing armed settlers. That's what they say. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1837.8400000000001s)]
*  That's what they do. They die on the land rather than rather than leave. And I think Gaza will do [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1841.8400000000001s)]
*  the same thing. I'm surprised that Gaza has held out for as long as it has. I'm surprised there [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1846.8000000000002s)]
*  aren't more anti Hamas demonstrations taking place. I'm really surprised that this has gone on [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1852.88s)]
*  because this is like being starved into submission. But we're under a big, big illusion [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1858.72s)]
*  if we think we've got rid of resistance groups by doing this. I think you've just handed the [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1866.4s)]
*  torch to an even more violent generation. The Fatah will not benefit or the Palestinian authority [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1873.6000000000001s)]
*  will not benefit if Hamas is crushed. Quite the reverse. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1882.64s)]
*  Well, David, I really appreciate your time today. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1887.76s)]
*  Sorry for being so gloomy. I mean, I- No, I mean, but overall it is so much suffering. But in terms [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1891.0400000000002s)]
*  of the overarching theme of your piece, they're winning these battles. They will win every battle. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1899.1200000000001s)]
*  Like Palestine doesn't have an air force. It doesn't have an airport. Like the way I mean, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1907.04s)]
*  a lack of symmetry here. They control the borders of the area that they're bombing. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1912.32s)]
*  Like there's no way for this to be an equivalent military conflict. And yet overall, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1918.0s)]
*  because of the barbarity, I think you're right in the overarching view of Israel's loss here. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1925.04s)]
*  David, thanks so much for your time today. Middle East Eye does wonderful work. Everybody should [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1932.4s)]
*  check it out. Thanks so much for your time today. Really appreciate it. Thanks, Emma. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFecIa1waZM&t=1937.36s)]
