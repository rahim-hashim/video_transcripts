# Netanyahu Glazes Trump While Cutting Off Water To Palestinians
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [March 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs)
*  Israel has decided to prevent any humanitarian aid to reach Palestine, Palestinians in Gaza now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=0.0s)]
*  Which is an admission that they could do it. I just want to point that out. We heard for so [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=8.08s)]
*  many months that Hamas, I mean, Hamas is blocking it and stealing all of the aid and we're trying [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  to get all of these trucks in, but the terrorists are thwarting us. And now they're just essentially [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=20.88s)]
*  saying, now we're cutting it all off. And there was a top Likud official that was saying, oh, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=26.0s)]
*  actually bomb the aid that's already in there. And they've cut off water salination for all [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=30.48s)]
*  of central Gaza. And the photos of devastation, like they were doing Ramadan celebrations amidst [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=36.56s)]
*  this rubble, there's nothing left, barely any homes left. And now they're trying to, I think, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=42.56s)]
*  execute their final solution in Gaza by starving them to death. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=50.24s)]
*  Ostensibly, it is about the hostages, but Israel has been breaking the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=56.56s)]
*  ceasefire deal over and over again. Three days ago, was it? Four days ago, they announced that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=66.64s)]
*  they would not be leaving the Philadelphia corridor, which of course, also contrary to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=72.8s)]
*  the ceasefire deal. And the US government, once again, consistently saying, oh, you're [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=79.36s)]
*  violating a ceasefire deal? Well, perhaps you would like $4 billion more in aid. Here you go. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=90.0s)]
*  That's what we're going to seeing. Here is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=96.24s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu on Sunday, thanking Trump for his unwaiving support of Israel. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=103.44s)]
*  I want to thank President Trump for his unwavering support for Israel. During my recent visit to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=112.63999999999999s)]
*  Washington, I said that Donald Trump is the greatest friend that Israel has ever had. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  In the White House. Now, and President, I was there for a second. This is Sunday. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=125.6s)]
*  Two days after. J.D. Vance is in the White House with Donald Trump telling Zelensky that he hasn't [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=133.68s)]
*  properly thanked the president. Now, incidentally, Jay Zelensky at the beginning of that press [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=141.68s)]
*  conference did in fact thank the American public. The Ukrainians are running like training schools [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=148.16s)]
*  for the US and EU on what they've learned in the three year fight that they've had with Russia, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=157.12s)]
*  which is a which, you know, is obviously pulling people away from the front and the fight. But [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=164.16s)]
*  that type of payback is invaluable, whereas Israel is probably just spying on our top government [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  officials based upon just based upon past experience. Yeah. But here is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=179.52s)]
*  Netanyahu coming out, making sure to do a very splashy thank you to Donald Trump. It's almost [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=187.28s)]
*  as if there is a nexus between Russia and Israel and the US in this instance. Yep. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=193.84s)]
*  Is the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  And President Trump shows that friendship each and every day. He has shown it through his visionary [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=207.28s)]
*  plan for Gaza. This is a plan which Israel fully supports. He's shown it by sending us all the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  munitions that were being held up this way. He's giving Israel the tools we need to finish the job [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  against Iran. Sorry, it's just you don't even need to take it down, but just want to clarify that's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  2000 pound bombs that the one thing Biden did was block, even though he let Israel commit genocide [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=230.48s)]
*  the entire time. It can take out two football fields of people. And he has shown it by fully [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=235.6s)]
*  backing Israel and putting the pressure to release the hostages where it truly belongs on Hamas. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=245.6s)]
*  Israel has accepted President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff's plan to extend the temporary [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=253.44s)]
*  ceasefire by 50 days. During that time, we can discuss the conditions for a permanent ceasefire [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=259.6s)]
*  that will end the war in Gaza. In Witkoff's plan, half of the hostages would be released right away [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=265.92s)]
*  and the remaining half would be released if we reach an agreement on a permanent ceasefire. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=272.32000000000005s)]
*  Again, Israel has accepted this plan. I accepted this plan. Okay, I'm sorry. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=277.68s)]
*  He's lying here again. So Jeremy Scahill tweeted this. He has connections with people at [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=283.12s)]
*  in the high levels of Hamas that they didn't even see Witkoff's plan or were not briefed about it [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=289.44s)]
*  at all, according to Scahill prior to Netanyahu coming out publicly and saying that they had [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=295.92s)]
*  rejected Witkoff's plan and the ceasefire deal that initially they'd agreed to had said that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=301.2s)]
*  if negotiations are still ongoing about the second phase of the ceasefire deal and the hostage [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=307.2s)]
*  release that you can't violate the ceasefire. You still have to be engaging in these negotiations. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=313.12s)]
*  So he's claiming that Hamas is violating it even though they weren't briefed on this new Witkoff proposal. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=319.12s)]
*  Israel has accepted this plan. I accepted this plan, but so far Hamas has rejected it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=328.88s)]
*  No. Hamas had also put forward positions for a permanent ceasefire that are totally unacceptable. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=334.88s)]
*  Israel has decided to stop letting goods and supplies into Gaza, something we've done for [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=340.88s)]
*  the past 42 days. We've done that because Hamas steals the supplies and prevents the people of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=345.52s)]
*  Gaza from getting them. It uses these supplies to finance its terror machine, which is aimed [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=351.76s)]
*  directly at Israel and our civilians. And this we cannot accept. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=357.76s)]
*  Pause it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=361.2s)]
*  We will. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  So we are to believe that they are turning around. They're completely surrounded. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  The only way to get supplies in to Gaza is through Israel, right? Because they're at the Philadelphia [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  quarter and they're obviously in their northern border. So the argument is that somehow Hamas [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=379.44s)]
*  is selling all of these supplies in, I would imagine, like great prices to all the people [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=387.35999999999996s)]
*  in Gaza who have been completely wiped out. It's not like, you know, there's ATMs on every corner [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=398.47999999999996s)]
*  in Gaza. Prior to everything being leveled, 50% of the people were unemployed. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=407.28s)]
*  People are starving there, yet they have enough money to buy all these supplies from Hamas [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=413.28s)]
*  so that Hamas can build, use this money to weapons. Like, where is Hamas selling these supplies? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=422.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  It's just absurd. It's just impossible. They don't have some type of like, they have this [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=429.84s)]
*  underground railroad. They're selling these supplies in the Sinai desert. They're selling [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  the supplies in the Sinai desert. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=441.6s)]
*  It's insane. I mean, he's under ICC. You know, there's a warrant out for him. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=445.92s)]
*  And one of the crimes that is alleged is starvation as a part of the genocide that he's [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  committing. And then in this video, he's laughably trying to claim that he cares about people [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  starving. So what's the alternate, if you're so concerned that Hamas is taking all the aid [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=465.36s)]
*  and it's not going to people, how are you going to get aid to them? Because he doesn't answer [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=470.4s)]
*  that second part of the question, because the whole thing is just a pretext for starvation [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  to kill them all. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=479.52s)]
*  Hamas presumably is selling all the food aid to like McDonald's or some type of big [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=482.08s)]
*  restaurant chain. And that's how they're getting all this money. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=488.08s)]
*  Which is aimed directly at Israel and our civilians. And this we cannot accept. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=492.4s)]
*  We will take further steps if Hamas continues to hold our hostages. And throughout this, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=497.28s)]
*  Israel knows that America and President Trump have our back. Thank you again, President Trump. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=502.56s)]
*  Thank you for all you're doing to return our hostages, bolster our security and provide a [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=509.2s)]
*  future of prosperity and peace for all the peoples of the Middle East. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=518.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump is out there. This is the free speech warrior. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=519.68s)]
*  He announced on Truth Social. And again, I don't think he has the legal authority to do this. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=530.9599999999999s)]
*  But I think people are, you know, at least the mainstream media completely missing the point. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=540.48s)]
*  But he writes all federal funding will stop for any college, school or university that allows [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=545.68s)]
*  illegal protests. What are illegal protests? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=551.68s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=556.4s)]
*  Agitators will be imprisoned or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=558.8s)]
*  American students will be permanently expelled or depending on the crime, arrested. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=564.64s)]
*  No masks. Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=569.12s)]
*  Oh, that is so revealing because remember, we covered that story about how Nassau County, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=572.48s)]
*  Long Island banned masks. That's not about it. That's not about covid. I mean, some parts of [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=577.0400000000001s)]
*  the country it is. It's really about this. It's about it's about protests against Israel. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=583.44s)]
*  But people don't seem to understand, you know, you watch mainstream reporters going like, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=591.76s)]
*  mainstream reporters going like, how is this more efficient? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=597.6800000000001s)]
*  And but this is really going to hurt these agencies that they supposedly want to help. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=600.72s)]
*  Like, do people not understand what the agenda is here? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=605.2s)]
*  The agenda. This is the feature. This is not the bug. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=609.0400000000001s)]
*  All they care about is creating this type of confusion, making it relentlessly hard [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  for federal workers to do their jobs. This is just, you know, a sop to, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=620.8s)]
*  I guess, you know, Miriam Adelson [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=628.64s)]
*  and the Zionist lobby and the yeah, the Zionist lobby, APAC. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=632.64s)]
*  Do we have the RFK thing too? I just oh, yes. Here is Maha. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=638.8s)]
*  You know, there's a meals outbreak throughout the country. I saw some reports of there's an [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=644.8s)]
*  increase in dysentery in the Pacific Northwest. But this is how we have to really worry about [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=648.8s)]
*  making America healthy again. They fired incidentally all at the USDA accidentally. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=655.28s)]
*  All the people who were in charge of keeping the bird flu under control on in our AV, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=661.28s)]
*  their chicken populations, basically, upholstery populations. Here is Secretary Kennedy [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=668.0799999999999s)]
*  talking about the need for vaccination and public health. Oh, no, I'm sorry. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=674.0s)]
*  Talking about college students. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=681.04s)]
*  Anti-Semitism like racism is a spiritual and oh, let me help. Yes. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=685.2s)]
*  Anti-Semitism like racism is a spiritual and moral malady that sickens societies and kills [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=690.0s)]
*  societies and kills people with lethalities comparable to history's most deadly plagues. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=699.92s)]
*  In recent years, the censorship and false narratives of the woke cancel culture. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=707.2s)]

*  So embarrassing. The false narratives of the woke cancel culture have transformed our great [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=720.88s)]
*  universities into greenhouses for this deadly and virulent pestilence. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=728.8000000000001s)]

*  as he's talking about speech, freedom and open debate? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=754.0s)]
*  It's the same thing. It's the same project. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=757.44s)]
*  It's the exact same project. It's so grotesque. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=759.6s)]
*  Michael Brooks said one of the reasons he was over enrolled his eyes at standpoint [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=762.48s)]

*  And I think it's a real shame that this is the way we've ended up. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=790.32s)]
*  And as these universities get attacked and like Peter Thiel's on Dave Rubin saying, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaI-Lvo7YSs&t=794.4000000000001s)]
