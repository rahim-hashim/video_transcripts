# MAGA Warns Trump: STAY OUT OF ISRAEL-IRAN
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4)
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene believes there are Jewish space lasers. So when Bibi Netanyahu says something [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=0.0s)]
*  That sounds threatening. He has control over the weather lasers and whatnot [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=8.44s)]
*  with that said [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=14.32s)]
*  she apparently has decided that it's in her best interest to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=15.84s)]
*  Parlay her anti-jewish [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=21.78s)]
*  Beliefs into something a bit more palatable, which is this kind of and again [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=24.04s)]
*  Yeah, this is Pat I can't list off. Yep. This is the same stuff back in I remember back in oh four [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=29.2s)]
*  Oh five I would be brought on Pat Buchanan show on MSNBC [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=37.64s)]
*  He would sometimes be filling in I think for Tucker or something and Buchanan would bring me on because I was the only Jew we [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=43.04s)]
*  Could find who is willing to criticize Israel and it gave him some measure of cover [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=49.56s)]
*  And it took me a while to realize this yeah to be honest with you I was a little bit naive at that time [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=56.0s)]
*  It didn't occur to me until I think I was at the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=64.36s)]
*  2004 Democratic Convention talking to some right-winger on radio row. He didn't realize [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=67.48s)]
*  That I was [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=73.92s)]
*  Well, I think he knew that I was at Air America, but he didn't realize much else when he said to me [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=75.88s)]
*  I'm not like one of those, you know neocons. I'm like, you know, Pap you can't a guy those neocons [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=80.68s)]
*  They're all Jews [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=86.68s)]
*  Hello clarifying Candice Owens is also in that bucket Tucker Carlson to write [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  So those are the people that for right now we need them if we want to pressure Trump not to go into war with Iran [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=95.72000000000001s)]
*  Well, we'll exist whether we need them or not. They're there fair enough. We'll take work. I guess sure [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=101.84s)]
*  Congresswoman green you have been a voice of reason and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=107.54s)]
*  America first policy. Tell us how you see this conflict between Israel and Iran [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=111.86000000000001s)]
*  Matt I see it just as you do and you laid that out so well, that's the America first message [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  But it's also the truth that the American people have woken up to we've watched for decades [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=124.06s)]
*  Propaganda news I'll call out Fox News and the New York Post they're known to be the neocon [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=129.86s)]
*  Network news we have propaganda news on our side just like the left does and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=135.34s)]
*  The American people have been brainwashed into into believing that America has to engage in these foreign wars [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=140.46s)]
*  In order for for us to survive and it's absolutely not true [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu said I saw on video [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=153.66s)]
*  He said today that America first is America dead and that sounds like a threat to me and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=156.78s)]
*  I completely completely disagree with him on that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=163.18s)]
*  In order for America to not be dead [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=166.86s)]
*  It's to stay America first and this is what the American people want. It is not anti-semitic [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=169.34s)]
*  To say that we do not want to go to war against Iran or any other country [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=175.9s)]
*  That is not that is not anti-semitic at all. It's actually rational [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=181.66s)]
*  It's saying and it's loving to people all over the world a middle-class country [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  All over the world a middle eastern war will will pull America back [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=191.5s)]
*  20 years just like you showed [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=196.7s)]
*  In in your intro for your show, it's exactly the lies that we were told after 9 11 and many people know it's not true [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=199.42s)]
*  So i'm completely opposed to this war [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=207.42s)]
*  Of course, we don't want to see the people in israel bombed [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=210.78s)]
*  But they're only being bombed because israel attacked iran first [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=214.22s)]
*  And that's the truth that we need to be talking about and and matt I want to add on one more thing that I think is incredibly [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=219.66s)]
*  important [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=225.88s)]
*  Because fox news and and all these other news stations are not talking about it last week on thursday [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=227.1s)]
*  They held a vote in the knesset and net yahoo only won by two votes [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=233.1s)]
*  Because the polling is showing that if an election was held today he would lose [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=239.18s)]
*  Um what he's doing is not popular among the people in israel. They are tired of war. They they are so [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=244.61999999999998s)]
*  devastated after october 7th [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=251.16s)]
*  Um, but they are tired of war and he that vote happened last thursday [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=253.26s)]
*  um and then [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=258.86s)]
*  All right. I mean she's rambling here, but um, that part's not true [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=260.38s)]
*  They're they love the genocide part. I'm a real lot of them ready for war too, but but [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=264.38s)]
*  Interesting I think this is a little interesting just a little bit just a little bit right while she's doing uh, like I as you pointed out [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=269.90000000000003s)]
*  She's doing what trump did in 2016 [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=278.14000000000004s)]
*  Yes, and why is there low-hanging fruit here for her to go pluck like this? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=281.82000000000005s)]
*  It's because chuck schumer was recently saying trump is a taco for not standing up to israel exactly [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=285.74s)]
*  because you had uh chuck schumer [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=291.74s)]
*  Going out there and basically saying that trump was not [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=295.18s)]
*  Was complaining that trump was not attacking iran. No side deals. No side deals. Mr. Trump. Tell the american people [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=299.42s)]
*  We gotta figure out what the hell is going on. Yeah on one hand [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=306.06s)]
*  I can look at a video [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  Of a u.s [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=314.06s)]
*  Senator being tackled by ice and handcuffed and i'm not going to react until I get more information on the other hand [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=315.18s)]
*  Why are we not invading iran? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=323.66s)]
*  What kind of bull is this all over the lot [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=326.14s)]
*  That's what he said. He's all over it's it's crazy town [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=329.98s)]
*  I mean, I have it right here if this is what if I mean, it's just an abdication of leadership, right? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=334.38s)]
*  It's an abdication of leadership by by chuck schumer the corruption of leadership by both him and jeffries. What the hell [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=340.54s)]
*  I mean, this is the thing. How can any democrat who takes uh apac or dmfi money be trusted on this issue? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=346.53999999999996s)]
*  Who's the best one who's the best democrat at standing up to war that has taken that money to run their campaigns [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=352.85999999999996s)]
*  Chuck schumer in that video. It was just so astounding to me. I asked godheimer [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=358.38s)]
*  I was actually showing that video on friday with some family because I was just like this is just I want you to watch this [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=363.65999999999997s)]
*  So you can see what my criticisms are of democratic leadership? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=369.26s)]
*  And I said, can you see what the message is that comes out of this video that chuck schumer put out there? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=372.94s)]
*  There's no clear message [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=378.14s)]
*  There's nothing actionable about it that would galvanize people politically all it is is saying one trump's chickening out on being more hawkish with iran [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=379.34s)]
*  By negotiating and two that he's all over the line [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=387.17999999999995s)]
*  He's flip-flopping like even if you were in favor of war with iran or something like that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=390.85999999999996s)]
*  But you were a democrat you're supposed to have attacks that hit them in a clear way [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=396.29999999999995s)]
*  And schumer's attack is just that he's vacillating. No [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=401.17999999999995s)]
*  Side deals who's the constituency for this outside of the israel lobby and the donors that they're going to come to you [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=404.86s)]
*  Yeah, can we can we just though for a moment? Yes point out the fact that you were doing this on the eve of your wedding [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=411.18s)]
*  Yes [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=419.90000000000003s)]
*  It was during the daytime [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=422.38s)]
*  First of all, i'm so happy you're all here to celebrate my wedding. But first [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=424.94s)]
*  This critique of chuck schumer. Yep. Yep. We won't rest [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=430.78000000000003s)]
*  We won't risk [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=434.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they know what they're getting with me I know [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=437.90000000000003s)]
*  That's awesome. Hey for weeks. All we've heard is how trump's big beautiful bill will cut medicaid [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=442.3s)]
*  But almost no one's reporting on a buried provision that would make trump untouchable [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=448.06s)]
*  Go to ground.News slash majority to see how this bill would block judges from enforcing court orders [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=452.86s)]
*  Unless you the citizen post a bond first [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=459.90000000000003s)]
*  Highly credible sources warn most people can't actually afford to do this and that's pretty obvious [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=463.34000000000003s)]
*  So if this bill passes and trump violates the law it wouldn't even matter [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=469.1s)]
*  And nobody even knows which means the g.o.p's flood the zone strategy is working [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=473.9s)]
*  And it's why I think ground news is the best tool to expose these blind spots before it's too late [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=479.02s)]
*  My partner's built the only app and website pulling in news from across the globe [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  Than breaking down each source's bias credibility and the news the right tries to bury [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=490.14s)]
*  And considering most people take the first article they see online as fact their browser extension is essential [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=496.46000000000004s)]
*  What it does is it flags the source's bias and links other credible reports to verify the information [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  Ground news is a better version of how we're already staying informed [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=508.94s)]
*  So I got you 40 off the same unlimited access vantage plan that i've been using [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=512.7s)]
*  That's just five dollars a month when you go to ground.News slash majority [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=518.14s)]
*  Scan my qr code or redeem the code majority if you're using the app [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=522.86s)]
*  With at least another four years of this they're counting on you to be distracted [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=527.9s)]
*  This app is how you stay focused [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn3hSYDK9o4&t=532.6999999999999s)]
