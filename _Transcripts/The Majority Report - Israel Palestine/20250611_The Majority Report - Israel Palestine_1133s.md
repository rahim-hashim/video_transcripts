**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM)
*  This luminary here, Dave Portnoy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=0.0s)]
*  has some thoughts about what he hopes happens. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=4.34s)]
*  What he hoped would happen. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=8.38s)]
*  I guess this was last week. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=10.72s)]
*  This is also in the same. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=12.18s)]
*  I don't know. People might have saw he made, you know, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=13.42s)]
*  beat his chest over not making anti-Semitic jokes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=15.36s)]
*  Maybe we can play that. This is no. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=17.98s)]
*  We'll play that second. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=19.22s)]
*  I want I want people to see how this freak [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=20.32s)]
*  can say this and then say what he says next. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=24.3s)]
*  This is the Zionist, you know, two facedness that you get. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=27.34s)]
*  Have a little pressure on you as being a very prominent. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=31.94s)]
*  So should Jewish person. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=34.54s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, you have to kind of be in this position. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=36.74s)]
*  You're fighting the battle. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=39.32s)]
*  I'm out there. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=40.52s)]
*  A Jewish person in entertainment. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=41.52s)]
*  I don't know. Die alone. Another well played job. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=42.88s)]
*  But the Internet's different now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  Like this is the right one. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=46.82s)]
*  Oh, no, this is the right one. This is the greater one. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=48.46s)]
*  Yeah, this is when he lets the like anti-Semitic remark fly. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  But their slide. OK. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=54.5s)]
*  But then he goes on. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=56.86s)]
*  Great. No, it's in the same clip. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=58.6s)]
*  Me neither. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=60.36s)]
*  It is crazy, though, if we're being honest, this is also my whole story. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=62.26s)]
*  Jews control the media. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=65.84s)]
*  It's like, well, we're not doing a great job of it right now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=67.0s)]
*  You are. You are. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=70.4s)]
*  Who's ever like they're asleep, like at the helm. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=71.74s)]
*  But now you I just got to say Zionists and this includes Zionist Jews. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=75.24s)]
*  This is not just like Josh Hawley, who is more comfortable to say this about [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=79.78s)]
*  are actively cultivating anti-Semitism with this goddamn bullshit. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=84.12s)]
*  Like he's literally granting the premise that Jews control the media. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=88.46s)]
*  Are you joking? Like that's anti-Semitic. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=92.26s)]
*  So Brandon doing the same shit yesterday, like, oh, we can say what we want [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=94.86s)]
*  because we have a Jew producer, literally what he said. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=97.94s)]
*  I mean, and this will get no call out from the ADL [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=101.24s)]
*  because they're on the same team, which is the nationalist team. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=106.44s)]
*  It's not the anti-hate team. It's the nationalist. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=108.98s)]
*  They're on the team with Elon Musk, who did the sick aisle. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=110.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=113.2s)]
*  Who's ever like they're asleep, like at the helm. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=114.4s)]
*  But now you you should just go over to Gaza. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=117.94000000000001s)]
*  We can do unnamed. You can be live. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  I'll jump on ground. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=122.54s)]
*  Jump on Greta Van Forsten or whatever that girl's she's sailing there. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=123.72000000000001s)]
*  Whoever that fuck. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=128.32s)]
*  I hope they hit a fucking like a missile on her boat. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=129.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, I hope they hit a missile on the boat. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=133.66s)]
*  I hate when I hit a missile on a boat down, Greta, whatever her name. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=137.9s)]
*  Bloomberg, I believe, right? Yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=141.68s)]
*  Yeah. Have a little. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  Thanks for the correction there. You little. Hmm. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=144.85999999999999s)]
*  This is exhausting. Dave Portnoy age. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=148.56s)]
*  Oh, I was going to say he's 50, but it's a little [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=153.4s)]
*  he's 48, to be fair to him. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=157.96s)]
*  He still has some growing to do. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=160.0s)]
*  I'm shocked that this guy who [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=162.85999999999999s)]
*  chooses to make his living as this provocateur, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=166.38s)]
*  but also encouraging gambling addiction among his followers, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  doing these reckless bets that he advertises like putting a million dollars [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=173.94000000000003s)]
*  on certain games, that he doesn't see the saliencing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=177.4s)]
*  what Greta's talking about, about an economic system of colonialism, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=180.28s)]
*  capitalism and exploitation that puts short term profits over human beings. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=183.58s)]
*  I know somebody that used to work with that guy, a good friend of my fiancee. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=188.98000000000002s)]
*  He's got some skeletons in his closet, got to say. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  And I mean, they're not even really in his closet. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=195.96s)]
*  They're actually just public. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=199.14000000000001s)]
*  But he denies, denies, denies the multiple sexual assault allegations [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  that were published in Business Insider, the public union busting [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=204.68s)]
*  that this guy engaged in. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=208.88s)]
*  Mistreatment of the people who work underneath him that I've seen online. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=211.08s)]
*  The women that, yeah, that have worked underneath him, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=214.52s)]
*  let alone the just like the guys at Barstool Sports. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=217.38s)]
*  These two little men. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=221.82s)]
*  This is the time this is so this is such a toxic, toxic [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=223.9s)]
*  kind of like incentive structure for media that is geared towards men right now. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=228.78s)]
*  And they get off on this, does it like like the obsession with Greta is both [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=234.92s)]
*  it in particular also, it's also misogynistic. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=240.42s)]
*  And they are intimidated by the fact that she's a young woman [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=243.84s)]
*  who doesn't really who doesn't care about male approval [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=248.98s)]
*  and is solely focused on activism, being strident and being principled [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=252.5s)]
*  and not appealing to the male gaze or to male comfort is threatening to those guys. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=256.56s)]
*  That's primarily what they're responding to. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=261.34000000000003s)]
*  As a man, I just have to say it is disgraceful that this has been put forward as the model. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=263.0s)]
*  These two schmucks, I've never seen him in my life before. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=268.26000000000005s)]
*  Letting their boss walk all over them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=270.64000000000004s)]
*  You hear him say he wants to drop a missile on the boat. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=273.68s)]
*  And the only thing you can do afterwards is correct his pronunciation of her last name [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=276.92s)]
*  and not object to it, because you know why? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  Because you're under his thumb. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=284.26s)]
*  Because he writes your checks. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=285.46s)]
*  Because you have no fucking courage. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=286.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=287.58s)]
*  Because the second you do that, you're out of a job. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=287.96s)]
*  And who the fuck are you then? A nobody. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=290.38s)]
*  And I mean, this just this little thing, this little soliloquy, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=292.76s)]
*  portnoy went on. This is how much like it's interesting. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=296.02s)]
*  Now, it's all these people that would downplay sort of SJW language or whatever [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  until it becomes about Zionism. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=303.29999999999995s)]
*  And then it's oh, actually, no jokes. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=305.29999999999995s)]
*  Let's play this. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=308.17999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, now it's now let's hear this this this guy cry [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=309.14s)]
*  now after he made an anti-Semitic joke, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=313.18s)]
*  after he said he hopes this activist, who's this 22 year old young woman's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=315.66s)]
*  boat is bombed, which it was a month and a half ago, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  right before she was going to board it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=325.22s)]
*  This is how he reacts when they basically these guys. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=327.66s)]
*  I don't agree with the statement that everybody should be able to be joked about. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=331.0s)]
*  I think jokes are funny usually when you're punching up [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  and not when you're punching down. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=337.0s)]
*  But their whole thing is we get to joke about whatever. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=338.70000000000005s)]
*  And then Portnoy has one exception to that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=341.94s)]
*  I think right now you probably OK, no, nothing. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=345.3s)]
*  Silence everything. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=349.02s)]
*  What do you every comedian? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=350.46s)]
*  Don't tell a joke about it because that's how the world works. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=351.86s)]
*  I agree. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=355.46s)]
*  I don't go back to your question. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  When does freedom of speech impinge your question? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=357.62s)]
*  Not mine. That was your question. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=359.74s)]
*  Answer it. How many deaths? Yeah. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=360.82s)]
*  I don't. I'm sorry. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=364.82s)]
*  This conversation is already insane. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=365.94s)]
*  They're talking about jokes about he says jokes about Jews. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=367.78s)]

*  Talking about the I think it was after the two people were shot, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=378.65999999999997s)]
*  the people who worked for the Israeli embassy in Washington. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=382.5s)]
*  Yeah. You know, three Palestinian students were shot last year. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=386.5s)]
*  None of you guys gave a fuck. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=388.85999999999996s)]
*  And that was caused by the exact same thing that the violence in Colorado was, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=390.61999999999995s)]
*  which is the ongoing genocide that our government is supporting, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=393.97999999999996s)]
*  which is raising the temperature on all this stuff. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=396.46s)]
*  So, yeah, they can talk about whatever they want. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=398.26s)]
*  This is him saying you can't make Jewish jokes. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=401.14s)]
*  And the thing is, is like a Jewish jokes or like jokes about Israel or whatever. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=404.02s)]
*  I don't know what these jokes were. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=409.02s)]
*  But this whole thing about like there's there's an on [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=411.02s)]
*  the way about religion. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=415.7s)]

*  In my mind, he is a supporter of the state of Israel. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=423.17999999999995s)]
*  He's like Michelle Bachman. He's like Mike Huckabee. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=426.02s)]
*  He's like Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=427.82s)]
*  That's the that's the classification I make on this. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=429.14s)]
*  He's an American Zionist. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=431.34s)]
*  This has nothing to do with his religion or anybody's religion. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=432.62s)]
*  This has to do with our foreign policy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=435.34s)]
*  And they use it like a shield and they should know what that means. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=437.85999999999996s)]

*  are the ones that were like the one he just made, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=445.5s)]
*  you know, a minute and a half ago on the same podcast. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=448.65999999999997s)]
*  They control the same podcast. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=451.18s)]
*  He says it's in the same show. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=452.9s)]
*  They control the media because Greta Greta is getting some sympathy in it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=454.22s)]
*  Oh, some any. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=457.58000000000004s)]

*  I mean, he sounds he's literally he sounds like the Likud people in that poll. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=464.14000000000004s)]
*  I just cited basically half of Israelis think that Fox News is too [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=467.18s)]
*  sympathetic to Palestinians. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=470.82000000000005s)]
*  And that's where Dave Portnoy is at. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=472.38000000000005s)]
*  And that's that's that's the terminal point for anybody who supports Israel. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=473.86s)]
*  Is you're going to be Likud? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=477.38000000000005s)]

*  I agree. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=489.78s)]

*  So now what? So now what do we do? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=507.14s)]
*  So maybe maybe you stop with the fucking Jew jokes and act like it's not a big [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=508.62s)]

*  We got to criminalize that free speech, according to him. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=615.5s)]

*  Like we already have laws about this. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=638.58s)]

*  owning the media and wanting to drop a missile on Greta Thunberg. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=645.78s)]

*  I'll recover from that, Dave. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=653.1s)]

*  So how many motherfucking Jews have to be killed before you stop? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=679.5s)]
*  Then everybody should. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=684.66s)]
*  I don't think what what we're seeing here is. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=685.78s)]
*  Fascist hysteria. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=689.86s)]
*  How many Palestinians need to be killed by the state of Israel [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=691.62s)]
*  before Dave Point? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=695.86s)]
*  And I wonder, is like, hey, maybe this rising anti-Semitism [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=696.74s)]
*  that has people coming to my bar is being somewhat provoked [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=700.78s)]
*  by the genocidal state that's saying it's doing so in the name of all Jews. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=704.1s)]
*  And by the way, Dave Portnoy supports it. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=707.22s)]
*  He who he got real red there. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=710.62s)]
*  I mean, look, I understand that if you're tanning that often, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=713.86s)]
*  there's like a baseline of redness that you got to. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=716.62s)]
*  Is there some drinking or drinking? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=719.02s)]
*  That's another possibility or some other intake or, you know, some others. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=721.62s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=726.3000000000001s)]
*  What else? Where else is that happening with the religion or people? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=728.66s)]

*  Are the worst people on the earth should do that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=735.38s)]
*  Do you think it's all related? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=737.42s)]
*  But Dave, you're telling a comedian not to make a joke. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=739.5s)]
*  It's not just came in the background with you, but you said stop. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=741.78s)]
*  Oh, you're screaming. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=745.3s)]
*  Jew jokes of that nature. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=747.5s)]
*  Sorry, I'm sorry. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=749.54s)]
*  Back 10 seconds, I talked over it, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=750.46s)]
*  but I just noticed that his dog appeared in the background [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=753.02s)]
*  because of the screaming go on. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=756.22s)]
*  Am I going for a walk scene? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=758.7s)]
*  But Dave, you're telling a comedian not to make a joke. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=760.46s)]
*  It's not a comedian. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=762.58s)]
*  I'm with you, but you said stop all jokes. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=765.1s)]
*  Jew jokes of that nature. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=768.42s)]
*  Right now, we'll ban you jokes of that nature. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=770.78s)]
*  We'll get the Constitution. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=773.78s)]
*  We'll get Congress and stop Jew jokes. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=774.98s)]
*  I'll go back to this. Yeah. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=777.22s)]
*  When does freedom of speech impinge on freedom of religion? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=780.18s)]
*  Well, I'm only freedom of speech. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=784.5799999999999s)]
*  I think freedom of speech is the most important thing in this country. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=786.38s)]
*  OK, so people can go kill the Jews and there's no responsibility [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=789.38s)]
*  if someone goes and kills Jews. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=792.5799999999999s)]
*  No, we have not legislation. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=794.14s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=797.02s)]
*  If people kill, that's literally the definition of murder, not speech. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=799.1s)]
*  No, no, like, look, graffiti and something. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=803.02s)]
*  What if you go up to a Jewish person and you say, I am on Hitler time. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=804.86s)]
*  I think we should kill the Jews. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=809.5400000000001s)]
*  That's against the law. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=811.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, honestly, these men, they just can't. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=814.4200000000001s)]
*  They can't be trusted to make decisions. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=818.02s)]
*  They're too emotional, Dave. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=819.82s)]
*  I mean, who am I as a man supposed to look up to here? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=821.94s)]
*  Yeah, we got other we got we got Stavi. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=825.4200000000001s)]
*  He's our he's our this is supposed to be because the right wing is all like [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=827.8199999999999s)]
*  the male role models. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=831.5799999999999s)]
*  Who am I supposed to look up here? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=833.02s)]
*  The guy on the left who's not saying shit, the guy on the right [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=834.3s)]
*  who like tries to flex his spine a little bit and then gets put directly in his place [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=837.22s)]
*  and just has to sit there and take it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=841.06s)]
*  I can't imagine like [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=842.5s)]
*  I I I'm angry at basically all three of these guys, but I it's [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=844.5799999999999s)]
*  it's really pathetic. Yeah, it's pathetic here. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=849.42s)]
*  Pull this up. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=852.62s)]
*  And then, I mean, who we don't need to hear any more of this, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=853.42s)]
*  but it's just people want a sense of [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=855.82s)]
*  portnoy's deep anti Arab and anti Muslim racism [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=860.58s)]
*  as he cries about, you know, wanting to criminalize certain hate speech. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=864.5400000000001s)]
*  Let's see how he engaged. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=870.1s)]
*  This is like pretty early on in their show. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=871.5s)]
*  Not sure when this was. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=875.1800000000001s)]
*  It's funny because the one good guy that works there is on the top left. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=876.98s)]
*  Sort of good, although, again, it's the we're talking in degrees here. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=881.0600000000001s)]
*  And by comparison, Big Cat, who mocks him at the end. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=884.98s)]
*  But this is just like how he thinks about Arab people and Palestinians. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=889.22s)]
*  This just came out in a live stream they must have done like 10, 15 years ago. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=893.26s)]
*  Oh, Capra, not standing to the national anthem has become a huge story. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=897.38s)]
*  So I'm going to say something that's racist, but I don't think it's right. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=903.34s)]
*  I don't think if you think something and don't say or act upon it, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=906.58s)]
*  you can be called a racist. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=910.74s)]
*  But you're saying, oh, but you're going to say. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=911.86s)]
*  I'm going to say it. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=914.82s)]
*  When I heard the story, I didn't read it. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=916.14s)]
*  I didn't know why I was saying that. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=917.78s)]
*  I was like, oh, he's an ISIS guy. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=919.42s)]
*  Like, that was my original thought, because he kind of looks like [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=921.14s)]
*  he is very confusing. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=925.62s)]
*  He is very confusing. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=927.02s)]
*  I will give you that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=928.26s)]
*  I mean, go ahead. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=929.22s)]
*  Brattle on this. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=930.78s)]
*  We you thought he was not standing for national anthem [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=932.42s)]
*  because he wanted to like kill all Americans? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=935.1s)]
*  No, I thought he maybe had some terrorist our Arabic. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=938.62s)]
*  Listen, maybe it was maybe it was like a Palestine side or something. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=943.18s)]
*  That's dumb. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=947.54s)]
*  That's an interesting comment. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=948.86s)]
*  It gets worse. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=950.54s)]
*  But he is first team, all racial confusion. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=952.82s)]
*  I don't know what's going on there. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=956.54s)]
*  You know, the fear is crazy. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=958.46s)]
*  He's got to do like he's got to do it. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=960.5s)]
*  You throw your terrorist beard, terrorist skin. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=962.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So I didn't give much thought of it. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=966.14s)]
*  I was like, why won't he stand? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=969.46s)]
*  I didn't. I'm not like, oh, it never. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=971.54s)]
*  He's not. He thinks black people, which I guess he's black. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=974.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=979.1s)]
*  OK, so I didn't know that. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=980.98s)]
*  I thought he was Arabic. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=982.26s)]
*  So I when I think an Arabic [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=984.06s)]
*  Arab person is not standing for the national anthem. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=987.78s)]
*  I go terrorists right away. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=990.58s)]
*  I just can't be held against me. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=992.5s)]
*  It's just how my brain works. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=994.42s)]
*  You can't say someone's. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=995.7s)]
*  I don't think I would never do anything. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=997.18s)]
*  But that's how my brain worked. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=999.26s)]
*  I'm just being honest. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1000.34s)]
*  That's what I can't. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1001.7800000000001s)]
*  I can't laugh at you because I went down this road without Al Jazeera. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1004.46s)]
*  Sometimes your brain just goes terrorism. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1008.46s)]
*  And so I, you know, Dave, Dave's is Colin Kaepernick. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1010.6600000000001s)]

*  I'm not racist. Now we're doing. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1019.82s)]
*  You can't hold my racist brain against me. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1022.1s)]
*  Against me. Bill Parcells, Bill Parcells. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1025.74s)]
*  No offense to the Japs. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1028.58s)]
*  That's it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1029.82s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1033.74s)]
*  Did that just prove my point for me, right? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1034.8600000000001s)]
*  But some Israelis were killed after keeping people in a concentration camp [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1037.5s)]
*  for decades and decades and decades. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1041.5s)]
*  So free speech is over now. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1043.18s)]
*  What happened to if you don't act upon it, it's not racist. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IEFi93vaM&t=1044.7s)]
