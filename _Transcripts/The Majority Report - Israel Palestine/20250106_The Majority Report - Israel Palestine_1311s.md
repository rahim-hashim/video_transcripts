# Gaza Faces Ongoing Devastation In 2025
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA)
*  Meanwhile, the American Historical Association, this is an association that represents like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=0.0s)]
*  10,000 historians in this country. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Academics voted over, I guess it was on, maybe it was on Sunday, they voted 428 to 88. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=10.24s)]
*  This is at the group's annual conference. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=17.76s)]
*  That is an overwhelming number of people to approve a resolution opposing scholasticide [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=20.42s)]
*  in Gaza and the US government's funding of Israel's war. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=27.08s)]
*  Scholasticide means the intentional eradication of an education system. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=34.16s)]
*  The resolution, which says Israel's military campaign has effectively obliterated Gaza's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=38.44s)]
*  education system, calls for a permanent ceasefire and for the association to form a committee [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=43.12s)]
*  to help rebuild Gaza's educational infrastructure. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=48.44s)]
*  I've seen some people sort of say like, you know, what's the point of this? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=52.16s)]
*  Where's the material? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  The value of this, aside from it being recognized by scholars as to what's happened there, and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  increasingly we're seeing more and more Israelis as well recognize that what's going on there [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=69.56s)]
*  is genocide. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=76.6s)]
*  What the value is, is that on college campuses, where we have seen administrators attempt [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=79.92s)]
*  to shut down protests about what the US is doing in support of Israel and of Israel, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  and claim that is a function of anti-Semitism, I have no doubt there are anti-Semites on [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=98.8s)]
*  campuses, there are anti-Semites that have always been on college campuses, there are [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=106.44s)]
*  also vehement anti-Palestinians on college campuses. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=110.84s)]
*  But the idea that you have academics being punished by the administration for being supportive [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=118.2s)]
*  of Palestinians, for speaking out against Israel, this is going to make it a lot harder [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=125.36s)]
*  to do. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=132.94s)]
*  And it's going to make it a lot harder to justify these crackdowns because these protests [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=135.18s)]
*  are going to continue. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=141.98000000000002s)]
*  And it's also just important to have it on the record. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=144.46s)]
*  I just want to ponder that for a moment, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=150.86s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of children who have not had any education and have been out of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  school at the very least, but also experiencing high levels of starvation and malnutrition [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  and dehydration and the trauma of that since October 2023. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  This entire generation, if anybody who does survive, will both have physical scars and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=172.7s)]
*  you see images of children, little girls with their hair falling out from stress because [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  of how sad and terrified they are, but also just a generation lost in terms of being able [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=185.9s)]
*  to educate themselves and grow in a normal developmental pattern, even within the existing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=193.06s)]
*  structure of being inside of an open-air prison that Gaza was previously. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  And let's be clear, about a million of the two million people there, maybe more, are [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=204.62s)]
*  below the age of 18. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=212.54000000000002s)]
*  So when you have wiped out an entire education system, you're talking about like the, you [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=215.42s)]
*  know, this is not some platitude, the future of these people. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=225.1s)]
*  I mean, like this is a very, very like substantial material implications. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=231.54s)]
*  I mean, aside from all the other horrors that are going on there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=237.26s)]
*  There is an UNRWA official describing conditions in what she saw in Gaza, a Gaza hospital. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=240.54s)]
*  Again, we've reported in northern Gaza, virtually, not virtually, there are no medical facilities [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=253.42s)]
*  in the rest of Gaza. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=262.82s)]
*  There's barely any. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=264.18s)]
*  So I've been in Nasser hospital after one of these mass casualty events, so the strike [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=267.54s)]
*  in Mawasi, and it's exactly as the last couple of days has been described in the hospital. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=271.62s)]
*  It's chaos. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=277.06s)]
*  There is blood on the floor. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=278.06s)]
*  There is no hygiene equipment. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=279.06s)]
*  Doctors are trying to mop up the blood with water. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=280.94s)]
*  They're spreading infection. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=283.46s)]
*  You go to one room, I've had a woman scream at me in absolute despair and horror because [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=285.1s)]
*  her son was killed in a strike in the so-called humanitarian zone. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=290.46s)]
*  Her daughter was lying on the bed next to us, paralyzed, and she's screaming at us [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=294.94s)]
*  because she said the Israelis told us to move here because it was safe. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=299.02s)]
*  My son is killed. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=302.54s)]
*  My daughter is paralyzed. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=303.54s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=304.82s)]
*  Where do I go? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=305.82s)]
*  In the next room, there's a toddler who has lost two limbs with no parents. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=306.82s)]
*  And this is just on repeat. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=312.74s)]
*  This is what we see after every incident. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=314.65999999999997s)]
*  Now the Israelis are talking about ceasing quite soon cooperation with UNRWA. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=318.02s)]
*  If they do that, what happens to the large amounts of aid needed every single day to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=322.02s)]
*  be trucked into the strip? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=326.62s)]
*  When I left Gaza just a few days and weeks ago, the people were being crushed to death [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=328.46s)]
*  waiting for food, for flour, and children have now started freezing to death because [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=334.29999999999995s)]
*  they don't have enough shelter items. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=340.06s)]
*  This is the situation with UNRWA on the ground. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=342.28s)]
*  This is the situation with the largest humanitarian organization doing everything they can with [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=344.64s)]
*  the rest of the United Nations. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=349.1s)]
*  Healthcare workers have been saying this. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=357.22s)]
*  It's been falling on deaf ears. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=361.5s)]
*  We have- [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=363.26000000000005s)]
*  It's been evident for over a year. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=364.26000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=365.26000000000005s)]
*  In October, there was a letter that we encouraged people to sign from 99 U.S. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=366.26000000000005s)]
*  American, not terrorists, American physicians, surgeons, nurses, midwives who had volunteered [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=372.58s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=380.7s)]
*  And they said that the death toll was at minimum based on their calculation, 118,000. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=382.5s)]
*  And we're still seeing this like 45,000, 43,000 death toll number being repeated. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=388.62s)]
*  That's just so everyone who comments on it, like establishment newspapers, can feel slightly [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=395.65999999999997s)]
*  better when they say sit down with Anthony Blinken over a kale salad. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=400.98s)]
*  They say like, oh, what about the 40,000 people that have been killed? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=405.46000000000004s)]
*  Because if you actually said, hey, you in your Senate confirmation said that the Chinese [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=408.62s)]
*  were doing a genocide against the Uighurs. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=416.66s)]
*  Could you also use that word with what's going on in Palestine? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=419.06s)]
*  And Blinken just says no. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=421.98s)]
*  And that- [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=423.38s)]
*  Well, let's listen to that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=424.38s)]
*  Let's listen to this- [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=425.38s)]
*  Or read it, right? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=426.38s)]
*  It's a text interview, I think. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=427.46000000000004s)]
*  No, we have an interview. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  This is number 10. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=430.46s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=431.46s)]
*  This is, I don't know if it's specifically that interview you're referencing. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=432.46s)]
*  No, mine was the Financial Times. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=436.34s)]
*  This is- [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=437.94s)]
*  New York Times. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=438.94s)]
*  This is the New York Times. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=439.94s)]
*  Secretary Blinken worry that perhaps you have been presiding over what the world will see [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=443.06s)]
*  as a genocide? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=452.94s)]
*  No. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=455.46s)]
*  It's not, first of all. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=459.6s)]
*  Second, as to how the world sees it, I can't fully answer to that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=461.56s)]
*  But everyone has to look at the facts and draw their own conclusions from those facts. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=469.32000000000005s)]
*  We have. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=477.96000000000004s)]
*  And my conclusions are clear. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  This is misinformation. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=482.16s)]
*  There is, in the wake of this horrific suffering, the traumatization of the Israeli population, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=483.64000000000004s)]
*  the Palestinian population, and many others, there's also a light- [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  All right, I can't. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=499.16s)]
*  I know. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=501.36s)]
*  Look, it has been my position, it doesn't matter what you call it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  But it does matter to them. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=510.84s)]
*  But this is what's fascinating. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=514.36s)]
*  Click on that. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=517.56s)]
*  This is just a Holocaust museum in Houston. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=518.56s)]
*  There was apparently, according to a Holocaust museum in Houston, and I don't know, maybe [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=523.68s)]
*  it's not recognized by other Holocaust museums, I'm not sure. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=528.76s)]
*  But well, you could go, I guess you could go to the United States Holocaust Memorial [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=536.04s)]
*  Museum. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  But let's just stay here. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=545.9599999999999s)]
*  Genocide in Bosnia. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  Let's just scroll down. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=550.8399999999999s)]
*  Starting in 1992, Serbia set out to ethnically cleanse Bosnia and Herzegovina by systemically [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  moving all Bosnian Muslims. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=556.4s)]
*  Serbs attacked Bosnia with former Yugoslavian military equipment. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=560.88s)]
*  The Security Council decided that these enclaves should be safe areas, protected by a contingent [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=566.68s)]
*  of UN peacekeepers. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=574.12s)]
*  Serbs committed the largest massacre in Europe in one such area. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=577.0s)]
*  An estimated 23,000 women and elderly people were put on buses and driven to Muslim-controlled [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=580.08s)]
*  territory, while 8,000 battle-aged men were slaughtered and detained. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=585.08s)]
*  Now my understanding of people who complain about the saying that what's going on in [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=591.2s)]
*  Gaza, where incidentally in northern Gaza, most people have been expelled relative to [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=595.44s)]
*  who were there a year ago, have been expelled and driven south. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=601.52s)]
*  More than 8,000 men have been killed in Gaza. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=611.56s)]
*  We know that that's probably three times that amount of children have been killed. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=618.28s)]
*  But my understanding from people who say it's not a genocide is like, well, not everybody's [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=625.4s)]
*  dead. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=629.8s)]
*  It's just objectively a genocide. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=634.8s)]
*  Everyone's dead. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=637.64s)]
*  Like, OK, maybe if it gets to 200,000, we can call it a Holocaust or something like that. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=638.64s)]
*  It's just a genocide. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=642.64s)]
*  There's no ambiguity. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=644.12s)]
*  And it's a fake. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=648.6s)]
*  The idea that there is is just a waste of time. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=649.6s)]
*  I mean, I wish that I don't know what that New York Times reporter did if she followed [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=651.48s)]
*  up with, I mean, she did good follow ups with JD Vance prior to the election with his interviews, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=654.8s)]
*  but she should have said, is Amnesty International? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=660.64s)]
*  Are they full of anti-Semites? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=663.02s)]
*  Because they just concluded that Israel's... [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=664.9399999999999s)]
*  How about the human rights watch? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=666.7600000000001s)]
*  He was good enough to say other people might think it is. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=669.0400000000001s)]
*  I just don't. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=671.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=673.7600000000001s)]
*  I mean, he should be locked up, frankly. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=676.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=677.9200000000001s)]
*  That's as you say, it's the banality of evil, right? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=678.9200000000001s)]
*  Where you're sitting there doing PR spin for them. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=681.72s)]
*  I mean, he could be locked up and people could just simply say, like, you think you're locked [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=686.5200000000001s)]
*  up, but we don't. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=691.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=692.8800000000001s)]
*  I don't see you in one of the stock. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=694.08s)]
*  I don't see your arms and head through a stockade right now. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=696.24s)]
*  You might think and feel like they're in a stockade. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=699.2s)]
*  And this is just... [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=701.6400000000001s)]
*  I saw the movie The Brutalist last week, right? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=703.24s)]
*  Which is about the Holocaust in many ways. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=706.4000000000001s)]
*  And there's a character there who has osteoporosis from her malnutrition in a concentration camp [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=708.88s)]
*  and can't walk. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=715.6s)]
*  And all I could think about was Gaza and how many thousands of Palestinians are going to [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=717.88s)]
*  experience similar health outcomes if they're lucky enough to even survive this. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=724.9399999999999s)]
*  Their lives will be destroyed. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=729.5799999999999s)]
*  And if you don't see that connection there, you know, he's incentivized not to because [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=731.22s)]
*  he would be complicit in the genocide. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=736.26s)]
*  But if you also can't see it and you can only see it from the perspective of because the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=738.38s)]
*  United States was on the right side of that war and because the Holocaust has been used, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=743.5799999999999s)]
*  frankly, by the United States to paint ourselves internationally as the good side that's standing [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=750.42s)]
*  up against tyranny and domestically, that's how a lot of people perceive us. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=757.42s)]
*  If you can't see that we're inflicting that same exact damage, even if it's slightly indirectly [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=762.06s)]
*  with Israel right now and see that historical through line, then that's just a little bit [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=766.7399999999999s)]
*  of racism because you don't see Palestinians with the same level of humanity that you do [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=770.8599999999999s)]
*  people who are of whiter skin tone, who you may know in your personal life. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=776.34s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=782.7800000000001s)]
*  This is from a YouTuber, Corey Gill Schuster, interviewing people in Jerusalem. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=783.7800000000001s)]
*  Now, I'm convinced that in any cohort, you can find individuals who are going to say [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=792.9s)]
*  bad crap, crazy things that are not reflective of the broader cohort. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=800.14s)]
*  But there is absolutely zero indication from amongst the Israeli population and hashtag [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=809.1s)]
*  not all Israelis. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=819.54s)]
*  But but in terms of the majority, this is based upon polling. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=822.14s)]
*  This is based upon the fact that Netanyahu is in a much better position than he was a [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=829.5400000000001s)]
*  year and a half ago. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=834.94s)]
*  That this attitude and frankly, I will also say I don't have any Israeli relatives, but [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=837.7s)]
*  I definitely have people in my extended family whose perspective on this is very similar. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=851.3000000000001s)]
*  The idea that there are no Palestinians, they're just Arabs, which if you were to use that [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=859.42s)]
*  formulation about any other ethnicity, race, whatever you want to say, would be considered [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=870.46s)]
*  so reprehensible that none of these people would say it like you would never say, hey, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=881.26s)]
*  there's a war in the Congo and people are in South Africa. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=888.14s)]
*  There's black people all over Africa. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=895.1800000000001s)]
*  Why can't they just go into this country like you can't? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=896.98s)]
*  The idea of someone saying that, like I don't even remember anybody saying that during the [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=900.66s)]
*  height of support of South Africa and apartheid, even on the right, like nobody would ever, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=905.4200000000001s)]
*  ever think to say, look, the entire continent is full of black people living in other countries. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=911.94s)]
*  Why can't they just go there? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=920.58s)]
*  They're not South Africans. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=922.58s)]
*  This woman says that and worse. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=926.34s)]
*  How many civilians have been killed in Gaza from what you know? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=928.74s)]
*  Who gives a shit? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=933.3000000000001s)]
*  Okay, but don't you feel like, for example, children? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=935.46s)]
*  Children grow up to be Arabs. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=938.1s)]
*  I shouldn't say this. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=943.94s)]
*  I know I read the numbers last week. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=946.74s)]
*  My memory died and went to heaven. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=948.74s)]
*  I don't think children should suffer, but there are always casualties. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=950.98s)]
*  And since they do a lot of poor food, that is a natural result. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=955.7s)]
*  Do you understand why the world is so angry? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=962.5s)]
*  Because they keep seeing so much. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=969.0600000000001s)]
*  Overall, the world does not really understand what's going on here. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=971.5400000000001s)]
*  They do not understand, Grace, the concept that Israel was attacked. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=979.46s)]
*  And Palestinians, there is no such thing as Palestinians. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=984.58s)]
*  They're Arabs who have many countries to flee to and nobody wants them to. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=988.9s)]
*  But if we do call them Palestinians, their parents use them as human shields to gain sympathy. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=994.66s)]
*  The natural instinct of a Jewish mother is to protect her child. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1002.5s)]
*  Palestinian women do not have that. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1007.46s)]
*  How do you know this? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1011.0600000000001s)]
*  From years of living here. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1013.94s)]
*  Can you give an example of something you've seen? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1016.02s)]
*  Um, that is you just see in real time the dehumanization. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1018.26s)]
*  I'm a mother. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1024.5s)]
*  I have the motherly instinct like a human being to protect my children. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1026.1s)]
*  The Palestinians, they don't have that inherently, is what she's saying. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1030.1799999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1034.5s)]
*  We've heard from Israelis about Palestinians for decades. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1036.5s)]
*  But that, I want to just show, I mean, that sentence there says everything you need to know. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1040.26s)]
*  We are superior to them. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1045.46s)]
*  I am loving towards my children. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1047.14s)]
*  They put their children in harm's way. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1049.46s)]
*  Like that is basically how you make an entire population of human beings into essentially animals. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1051.7800000000002s)]
*  And like look at this lovely walk she's on. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1057.38s)]
*  I don't know where she's at, but wearing her son hat and walking around in some place in Israel, it seems. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1059.38s)]
*  Like that is the zone of interest when we're drawing parallels. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1064.9s)]
*  That is on the other side, just miles away, people are being systemically exterminated. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1068.26s)]
*  And here's essentially her saying it is what it is. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1073.5400000000002s)]
*  And like that's just brainwashing. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1077.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1080.66s)]
*  Palestinian women do not have that. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1082.1000000000001s)]
*  How do you know this? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1085.6200000000001s)]
*  From years of living here. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1088.5s)]
*  Can you give an example of something you've seen? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1090.66s)]
*  As I said, my memory died and went to heaven, but I read newspapers every single day. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1095.22s)]
*  And I've heard many different... [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1099.6200000000001s)]
*  Pause it. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1102.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1102.8200000000002s)]
*  Didn't she say from living here for years? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1103.22s)]
*  I can read newspapers. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1105.46s)]
*  I don't live there. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1106.58s)]
*  Was there something you've seen? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1109.3799999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1112.98s)]
*  In other words, like my total bigotry and racism is just founded upon what I've read to support that for years and years. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1113.3799999999999s)]
*  The idea of [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1124.1799999999998s)]
*  of [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1128.18s)]
*  parents not just using their kids as a prop to get sympathy. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1132.18s)]
*  It's just so twisted. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1139.78s)]
*  It is so twisted. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1144.18s)]
*  I mean, really, you don't even need comment. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1146.66s)]
*  And everybody knows. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1149.1399999999999s)]
*  The circular logic of we are more human because we care about the children, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1150.1s)]
*  but they don't because they put their children in harm's way, which is why we have to bomb the children. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1156.98s)]
*  And over and over again, there's no end to that. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1161.86s)]
*  It's just another... [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1166.02s)]
*  Point out the logical fallacy about their so-called humanity. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1170.1s)]
*  They just come up with another reason why they're superior to Palestinians. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1173.78s)]
*  It's not sincere. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1176.58s)]
*  It's not sincere that they think... [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1177.4599999999998s)]
*  They're just trying to rationalize racism. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1179.9399999999998s)]
*  And publicly too, because I got to feel a lot of these people if they said, look, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1181.78s)]
*  if some kid wasn't being used as a human shield, but was in a completely different area, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1186.18s)]
*  but that's still got a bomb dropped on him, that's just what happens. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1189.94s)]
*  Well, she said that. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1192.82s)]
*  I don't actually care. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1193.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1194.26s)]
*  She said, who cares? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1194.82s)]
*  Oh, I shouldn't say that. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1195.86s)]
*  And then uses this. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1196.98s)]
*  And then does the propaganda line. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1197.94s)]
*  But this is actually a lot, frankly, more refreshing than what we deal with from the [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1199.3s)]
*  State Department or the press that says, oh, this is actually just a difficult military thing [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1204.4199999999998s)]
*  where people are trying to... [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1210.82s)]
*  No, this is the actual sentiment that's being delivered for. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1212.18s)]
*  Every time Joe Biden puts billions of dollars of arms out across the Atlantic, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1214.66s)]
*  this is what's being delivered for. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1219.7s)]
*  And you want to keep going? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1222.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1223.5400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1223.94s)]
*  But I read newspapers every single day and I've read many different stories where [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1225.78s)]
*  the woman took her child and put her in front and then she thought this is going to [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1234.5800000000002s)]
*  gain sympathy with her readers around the world. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1239.8600000000001s)]
*  And it does. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1243.7s)]
*  It is successful for them. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1244.66s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1246.82s)]
*  Because Israel is in a different way. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1247.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1249.38s)]
*  I don't want to hear her pissing herself about some rocket attack alarm. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1249.8600000000001s)]
*  So they're going off in Israel then. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1255.46s)]
*  Because if that's the case, basically, the Palestinians live under constant brutalization, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1256.98s)]
*  but we're supposed to have endless sympathy for her perspective on this. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1264.3400000000001s)]
*  Class was delayed in Haifa because of, yeah, who cares? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1267.06s)]
*  Stop blowing up every single educational building in Gaza. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1270.58s)]
*  Maybe people might care. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1273.94s)]
*  Really twisted. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1277.22s)]
*  I don't know how people... [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1278.26s)]
*  I mean, there's... [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1282.9s)]
*  It's a population that needs a signal from America that this is not acceptable. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1285.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1289.46s)]
*  And we don't do that at all. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWk5k5UGswA&t=1289.86s)]
