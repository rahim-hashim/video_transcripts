# Ben Shapiro Suddenly Cares About Trump's Corruption
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA)
*  Does Ben Shapiro suddenly find some integrity and realize, wait a second, I've been shilling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=0.0s)]
*  for Donald Trump and conservatives for so long. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=6.38s)]
*  I have been, there's been no thing that the Republicans or conservatives could do that [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=9.72s)]
*  I would find absolutely reprehensible unless, of course, it is in some way possibly linked [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=17.26s)]
*  to supporting the end of the killing and starving and bombing of Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=27.44s)]
*  Then all of a sudden, Ben Shapiro finds bribery a little distasteful, a little bit distasteful [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=37.92s)]
*  that the Trump administration is now preparing to accept a super luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=44.92s)]
*  jet from the royal family of Qatar. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  It is a $400 million gift available for use by President Trump as new Air Force One until [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=56.04s)]
*  shortly before he leaves office, at which time, according to the deal, the plane doesn't [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=62.36s)]
*  stay with the United States government. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  It then moves to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=67.4s)]
*  According to ABC News, the gifts had been expected to be announced when President Trump [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  was on his visit to Qatar. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=75.72s)]
*  A senior White House official said, it's not going to happen in Qatar anymore, presumably [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=78.0s)]
*  thanks to social media blowback. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=81.36s)]
*  President Trump put out a statement on Truth Social about the blowback saying, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=83.56s)]
*  So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a gift free of charge with 747 aircraft [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=87.56s)]
*  to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One temporarily in a very public and transparent transaction [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=91.56s)]
*  so bothers the crooked Democrats, they insist we pay top dollar for the plane. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=96.56s)]
*  Anybody can do that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=99.56s)]
*  The Dems are world-class losers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=100.56s)]
*  MAGA. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=102.56s)]
*  So, again, the arrangement itself is, shall we say, I believe the technical term, the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=104.56s)]
*  legal term, is skeezy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=110.56s)]
*  Sources told ABC News, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=112.72s)]
*  He's such a coward. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=114.72s)]
*  Such a coward. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=116.72s)]
*  It's skeezy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=117.72s)]
*  Is it skeezy? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=118.72s)]
*  Is it skeezy? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=119.72s)]
*  That is such a weird way to describe it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=120.72s)]
*  This is the first skeezy thing Trump has ever done. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=122.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=124.72s)]
*  Donald Trump is not a skeezy person. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=125.72s)]
*  We can't ever imagine that he would do something skeezy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  And the U.S. government has never done anything skeezy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=130.12s)]
*  Oh, the entire bloated $900 billion defense department budget. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=133.28s)]
*  That's not skeezy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=143.27999999999997s)]
*  There's nothing skeezy going on there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=144.27999999999997s)]
*  I mean, he is such a coward. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=146.0s)]
*  Even when he's being critical of Trump, he cannot say that this is like corruption. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=148.04s)]
*  And this must be the first time that Donald Trump has accepted bribes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=153.0s)]
*  Because, I mean, Ben's finally deciding to speak out about it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=156.2s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure that Ben Shapiro was screaming at the rooftops. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=160.44s)]
*  How can all of these people go to Trump hotels? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=164.12s)]
*  And I'm sure, I mean, really, I remember from the election just less than a year ago when [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=167.84s)]
*  Maryam Adelson said, I'm going to give you $100 million and you're going to help annex [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=174.32s)]
*  the West Bank. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=178.72s)]
*  Ben Shapiro was outraged about how skeevy it was and how transparent it was. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=180.72s)]
*  And he was hosting the Zionists at his golf course in Bedminster and saying, I'm going [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=186.32s)]
*  to do this kind of thing for you in a transaction. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=191.2s)]
*  I'm sure Ben Shapiro was on top of that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=193.64s)]
*  Or is it just when Arab people do it? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=196.4s)]
*  Well, I don't even know if it's just when Arab people do it, because I don't remember. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=198.56s)]
*  Oh, the Saudi thing? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=204.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=205.4s)]
*  Ben Shapiro ever going after Jared Kushner on the $2 billion Saudi Arabia deal that he [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=206.4s)]
*  had? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=215.68s)]
*  Well, that was in service of the Abraham Accords and, you know, potentially normalizing with [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=216.68s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  I guess this is what this is all about. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  It might be about Israel more than the racism. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  It must be also why Chuck Schumer has decided to finally grow a spine and is going to begin [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=225.36s)]
*  placing a hold on all President Trump's DOJ nominations because of this Qatar plane idea. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=231.56s)]
*  I didn't know there was a in case emergency break glass still case to break Chuck. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=237.84s)]
*  But now all of a sudden it's time to break it open. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  Did Chuck Schumer wake up? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=246.16s)]
*  He woke up. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=247.56s)]
*  That red APEC phone call. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=248.56s)]
*  The Bailey's called me. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  They're outraged about this plane. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=251.36s)]
*  Bailey's in Tel Aviv. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  Democrats, they insist we pay top dollar for the plane. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=256.92s)]
*  Anybody can do that. The Dems are world class losers. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=259.48s)]
*  Maga. So again, the arrangement itself is, shall we say, I believe the technical term, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  the legal term is skeezy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=269.6s)]
*  Skeezy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=271.24s)]
*  Sources told ABC News that lawyers for the White House Counsel's Office and the Department [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=272.24s)]
*  of Justice drafted an analysis for the Defense Department, concluding it's legal for the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=276.16s)]
*  DOJ to accept the aircraft as a gift and then later turn it over to the Trump Library and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=281.56s)]
*  then somehow does not violate laws against bribery or the Constitution's prohibition [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=285.64s)]
*  on emoluments. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=290.12s)]
*  The Constitution literally says the U.S. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=291.64s)]
*  Government cannot accept official gifts from any king, prince or foreign state. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=293.0s)]
*  You don't have to agree to go back, but I just want to say that I am willing to bet [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=296.04s)]
*  that this is the first time Ben Shapiro has said the word emoluments or emolumint clause [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=301.68s)]
*  without mocking people bringing up the emolumint clause. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  When you had like the presidential ethic chief from the first administration, basically [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump administration, you know, light his hair on fire about emolumints. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=321.24s)]
*  So just continue. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=325.8s)]
*  This is just hilarious. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=327.0s)]
*  Apparently, Attorney General Pam Bondi and the top White House lawyer, David Warrington, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  concluded it would be legally permissible for the donation of the aircraft to be conditioned [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=333.76s)]
*  on transferring its ownership to Trump's presidential library before the end of his term. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=337.79999999999995s)]
*  And apparently, Pam Bondi, who it should be mentioned at this point, was once a national [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=343.56s)]
*  fair registered agent acting on behalf of the government of Qatar, provided a legal [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  memorandum. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, pause it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=353.28s)]
*  I wonder how many times Ben Shapiro brought that up in the past. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  It's odd. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=358.0s)]
*  It's odd because this was all stuff, you know, when she was nominated, we talked about [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=359.79999999999995s)]
*  this. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=363.32s)]
*  But now he's upset about it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=365.35999999999996s)]
*  I wonder where he's going with this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=366.96s)]
*  Pam Bondi, who it should be mentioned at this point, was once a national fair registered [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=369.28s)]
*  agent acting on behalf of the government of Qatar, provided a legal memorandum addressed [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=375.08s)]
*  to the White House counsel's office last week after Warrington asked her for advice on [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  the legality of the Pentagon accepting such a donation. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=382.35999999999996s)]
*  We'll get to more on that in a second. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=385.44s)]
*  First, choosing simply safer. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=386.55999999999995s)]
*  OK, can we go? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=389.4s)]
*  Is there anything it is worth? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  Free as simply safe dot com slash Shapiro. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=394.88s)]
*  There is no safe like similar to speed dating. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  However, instead of meeting potential romantic partners. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=399.56s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=401.88s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=402.28s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=402.76s)]
*  I think. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=403.76s)]
*  No, no, that's not it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=404.64s)]
*  He comes back to it, doesn't he? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=406.55999999999995s)]
*  He must after the ad break. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=409.23999999999995s)]
*  You know, maybe we're getting too much agency to the players here. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=411.32s)]
*  It's like you ever throw a coin into a fountain and it's like you're wishing for good luck. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=414.56s)]
*  The Navy has bucked like three fighter jets off of aircraft carriers in the Red Sea in [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=420.68s)]
*  the past few weeks. So maybe that's like, you know, the sea is just returning the Navy [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=426.24s)]
*  a jet. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=431.28s)]
*  OK, I say let's start off with Qatar is not allegedly giving President Trump a four [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=432.4s)]
*  hundred million dollar jet out of the goodness of their sweet little hearts. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=437.4s)]
*  No matter what, special envoy Steve Woodcock says they try to stuff money in pockets and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=441.12s)]
*  totally bipartisan fashion. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=445.44s)]
*  Just rewind a few years while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, Qatar gave a million [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=447.0s)]
*  dollars to the Clinton Foundation for Bill Clinton's birthday. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=451.28s)]
*  And didn't even bother to inform the State Department, as they promised they would do. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  So, again, Qatar will court anyone it thinks will have power, Republican or Democrat. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=457.67999999999995s)]
*  It's an equal opportunity. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=461.76s)]
*  And as long as you can help whitewash their image or smooth over the fact that they are, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=462.88s)]
*  in fact, the world's largest proponents of terrorism on an international scale in terms [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=467.8s)]
*  of PR and in terms of putting money in pockets. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=472.48s)]
*  Qatar likes to present a modern Western friendly face. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=474.76s)]
*  Positive. Now, Qatar, why do I why does that name sound familiar? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=477.64s)]
*  Oh, I know what it was because I was reading about how Netanyahu shuttled money to Hamas [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=482.68s)]
*  for years. Mm hmm. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting because Qatar comes up because it is a partial funder of Al Jazeera. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=490.68s)]
*  Al Jazeera was really the only media outlet that was able to get out footage of the genocide [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=498.91999999999996s)]
*  until, you know, Israel's crackdown and also killed a record number of journalists in this [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  genocide. So they don't let Western outlets in unless it's very highly monitored by the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=511.47999999999996s)]
*  Israeli government, again, because they control Gaza's borders, land and sea. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=517.16s)]
*  And then for journalists who are Palestinian or who may be working for Al Jazeera, time to [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=519.96s)]
*  assassinate them. But we report we covered this maybe a month ago that when Netanyahu came and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=526.6s)]
*  visited the United States, he met reportedly or Tim Pool admitted it, that he met with him. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=533.24s)]
*  And I guess it was also Dave Rubin, among others. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=539.88s)]
*  Yeah, and this is why I think it's interesting because we're getting report. We know that the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=543.56s)]
*  Daily Wire, Ben Shapiro's office in some financial trouble. We know that Netanyahu met with two guys [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=548.5999999999999s)]
*  who had a record of taking Russian money, not asking many questions and taking Russian money, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=557.16s)]
*  and were victimized by it, both in Tim Pool and Dave Rubin. And according to the Jerusalem [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=565.0s)]
*  or sorry, not the Jerusalem Post, Jewish insider back then, Pool asked Netanyahu if there was a [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=570.68s)]
*  quote, a Qatari quote op to manipulate social media algorithms to make anti-Semitic and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=579.88s)]
*  anti-Israel episodes appear to receive an outsized number of views in order to incentivize [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=586.12s)]
*  podcasters and YouTubers to make more anti-Semitic content. Netanyahu was not committed on his [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=590.76s)]
*  content. Netanyahu was not committed on his response saying only that it's possible. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=596.76s)]
*  The prime minister emphasized in the context of Qatar as well as Iran that Israel and the U.S. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=601.8000000000001s)]
*  share the same adversaries. And I just think it's funny that the prime minister of Israel chose to [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=606.52s)]
*  meet with two YouTube streamers and that within the context of this conversation, Qatar's [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=612.84s)]
*  as a nation's ability to manipulate conversation around Israel was brought up when we know that [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=620.44s)]
*  it's really just like first person footage that people are seeing on TikTok of children getting [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=627.96s)]
*  blown apart. So I don't know. Add to what you're saying. Yair Netanyahu was tweeting about the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=632.76s)]
*  Qatari connection just days after the Tim Pool thing that we were talking about. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=639.48s)]
*  And you hear what Shapiro just said there that Qatar, you know, what was what he was saying, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=644.2s)]
*  like that it can they can look for bipartisan lay people to bribe or whatever. Doesn't matter. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=650.76s)]
*  Sounds just like they're projecting a lot a lot because this is what the Israel lot. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=657.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't think they need to bribe Ben Shapiro. I think they just need to support Ben Shapiro [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=664.12s)]
*  because Ben Shapiro is going to say that in the same way. Now, I'm like Tim Pool. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=671.08s)]
*  Tim Pool, I think you could actually pay him to change his mind about something. Right. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=675.24s)]
*  It would take, you know, he'd have to turn the ship a little bit slowly. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=679.8000000000001s)]
*  Dave Rubin, it would take about 15 minutes, it seems to me. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=682.84s)]
*  Why did you say that? I would also even I would also even be surprised [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=686.2s)]
*  if Pool asked that question on his own. That's what I'm trying to say. Like that's what I'm [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=690.5200000000001s)]
*  trying to say. You bring this up so that we can get a an American expert online perspective [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=695.96s)]
*  that maybe that Qatar is the villain here. You bring that up as a question and then we'll [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=703.32s)]
*  let that question hang out there. No, no, I think Tim Pool originated [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=709.32s)]
*  that thought independently using his own brain research skills. I'm just wondering. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=712.52s)]
*  I'm just wondering why Netanyahu felt that he had he it was a good idea to meet with two streamers [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=719.32s)]
*  who were just in the news for taking money from a foreign government on his second visit to the [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=727.32s)]
*  United States. We followed Tim Pool. And the Daily Wire is in some financial trouble. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=731.8000000000001s)]
*  Ben Shapiro is a rabid Zionist and anti-Palestinian racist on his own. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=736.7600000000001s)]
*  But I'm just flagging this for future reference. Well, the real the progressives are the real [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=740.9200000000001s)]
*  regressives. Is there any more to this? This [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=748.6s)]
*  to Islamic terrorists under the table. This is a regime that has for literally decades funneled [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=760.6800000000001s)]
*  billions of dollars into the hands of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Taliban. We're talking about [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=765.96s)]
*  Israel ongoing financial support that has strengthened Hamas's grip on Gaza, provided [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=770.9200000000001s)]
*  them with the resources and, yes, enabled terror attacks that killed innocent civilians. Doha, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=775.4s)]
*  which is the capital, their five star hotels are basically a retirement home for Hamas leaders. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=779.9599999999999s)]
*  Qatar has been incredibly accused by the Treasury Department, by international watchdogs, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=784.04s)]
*  by regional allies of allowing financiers, Volcaida, ISIS and the Muslim Brotherhood to [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=788.04s)]
*  operate within its borders. This is a country that has repeatedly failed to crack down on [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=792.4399999999999s)]
*  terrorist financing even after being pressured by the United States and its neighbors. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=796.84s)]
*  In 2017, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, quote, I don't know instances in which [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=800.52s)]
*  Qatar aggressively goes after networks of Hamas, Taliban or Al Qaeda. Qatar has, of course, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=804.68s)]
*  transferred almost two billion dollars to come out over the years, which, again, is one of the [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=809.7199999999999s)]
*  reasons it's so sick to send down Alexander to meet with the Emir of Qatar. If that's a thing [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=813.9599999999999s)]
*  that ends up happening here is the former Saudi foreign minister again. I was positive for a [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=818.3599999999999s)]
*  second. This is CNN reports December 12th, 2023 headline Qatar sent millions to Gaza for years [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=823.3199999999999s)]
*  with Israel's backing. The Times of Israel just three days ago report Netanyahu aid [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=834.2s)]
*  Yurik received payments. The senior advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin, you receive payments [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=842.76s)]
*  from Qatar dating back after just after a year after the war broke out. The Times of Israel in [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=848.12s)]
*  2023, Netanyahu propped up Hamas. Israel has allowed suitcases holding millions in [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=855.64s)]
*  Qatari cash to enter Gaza through its crossing since 2018. NPR, why Israel back in 2015, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=863.56s)]
*  back in 2015, why Israel lets Qatar give millions to Hamas? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=871.64s)]
*  Surely Ben Shapiro has Google. They haven't turned off the internet daily wire yet, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=880.12s)]
*  have they? Unclear. I mean, this is going back to 2015. You've got stories about it with NPR. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=885.4s)]
*  Netanyahu admitted it, that it's important that they continue to aid Qatar in subsidizing Hamas [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=894.76s)]
*  because they wanted to keep the Palestinians in the West Bank segmented from the Palestinians [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=903.4s)]
*  in Gaza. Like that was a part of their deliberate strategy. It's such a good point that Ben Shapiro [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=909.24s)]
*  makes about how this Qatari money could be going on to both Republicans and Democrats, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myWars8o1bA&t=914.44s)]
