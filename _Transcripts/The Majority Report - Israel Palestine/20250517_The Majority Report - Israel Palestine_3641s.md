# Trump Cashes In On US-Middle East ‘Diplomacy’ | Jeremy Scahill | TMR
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc)
*  Sam Cedar, Emma Vigeland on the Majority Report. It is a real pleasure to welcome back to the program, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=0.0s)]
*  Jeremy Scahill, investigative reporter, war correspondent, co-founder of The Intercept, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=4.88s)]
*  and now co-founder of DropSight News. Jeremy, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=11.44s)]
*  Thank you both for having me back. So you just, I guess it was about a week or two ago, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=18.88s)]
*  published an interview you had with Usef Hamdan, the, one of Hamas' leaders. And it is a stunning [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=26.4s)]
*  thing, I have to just say right up front, I want to ask you, you know, what your idea was behind it, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=40.4s)]
*  but it is stunning for Americans, for English speakers to be able to watch something like this, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  because it is so rare that we, who are following what's happening with the assault and genocide [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  and ethnic cleansing in Gaza, to hear from, directly from any Hamas, nevermind spokesperson, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  but leader in such a fashion. I mean, you know, I mean, starting around October 8th, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  I, it was almost impossible as an American not to know the names of about a half a dozen Israeli [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=81.52s)]
*  spokespeople. And, you know, at that time, in particular, you're like, there's not a single [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=88.0s)]
*  Palestinian, nevermind someone from Hamas. What, just tell us what your thinking is as a journalist [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=96.08s)]
*  in covering this. I mean, I think it's somewhat obvious, but reiterate that for us. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=104.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one way of thinking about it, Sam, is that, you know, much of Western media coverage [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  of wars in general is both literally and psychologically embedded journalism, that it's, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=116.55999999999999s)]
*  you know, it's, you're often embedded with the forces of the occupier or the invading force, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=124.0s)]
*  whether it's the United States or Israel, and this is a very common dynamic. But also, there's a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=129.84s)]
*  psychological embedding that takes place where journalists often prioritize overwhelmingly the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=134.4s)]
*  narrative of whether it's the United States or Israel. And this is journalistic malpractice not [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  to go to the other side of the barrel of the gun that is pointed at other nations or people around [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=147.84s)]
*  the world and say, you know, let's, let's actually talk to those people. Let's understand their [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=153.68s)]
*  perspective. So, you know, throughout my 25 years in journalism, a lot of what I've done is gone to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=158.8s)]
*  countries where the United States is engaged in a military action or a war and talk to the people [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  living under the bombs. And that often includes then talking to people like Al-Qaeda in the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  Arabian Peninsula in Yemen or the Taliban in Afghanistan or al-Shabaab in Somalia. And I've [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=176.24s)]
*  done all of that. In this particular war against the Palestinians of Gaza, the Israelis have [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=181.84s)]
*  prevented any international journalists from entering Gaza. And so the only responsible [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=188.72s)]
*  journalistic practice in my view to try to counter or to counterbalance the propaganda coming from [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=196.24s)]
*  the U.S. and Israeli side is to work with Palestinian journalists on the ground in Gaza so [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=202.72s)]
*  you can get actual reporting from the ground, not just opinions, but also talk to the officials [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=208.0s)]
*  from the organization that the United States and Israel have compared to the Nazis, have set our [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=214.48s)]
*  terrorists in the vein of ISIS and al-Qaeda, and to fact check the allegations of the powerful, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=219.36s)]
*  but also understand what is their motivation. And when you do that and when you give a space for [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  people to actually hear their perspective, then you understand that there's a lot more nuance [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  to the story than you've been shown. And I'll say that as someone who's also monitoring media [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  coverage, it's not that officials from Hamas, including Osama Hamdan, who I interviewed, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  are never on Western media. CNN has people from Hamas on occasionally. The New York Times interviews [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=251.28s)]
*  people from Hamas occasionally. But often what happens is it's just a re-litigation of the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=256.8s)]
*  events of October 7th where the same exact questions are asked over and over and over again. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=262.08s)]
*  And so what I wanted to do was say, let's treat our audience as smart people and let's sit down [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=267.76s)]
*  and have an in-depth, in this particular case it was a 90-minute conversation in English, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=274.48s)]
*  with a leader of Hamas who's been in the organization since its very early stages. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=281.2s)]
*  He became a member of Hamas in 1992. He's a chemist by training, and he's served as Hamas's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  chief in Lebanon, in Iran, and as the head of its international relations division. And he was one [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=293.44s)]
*  of two senior Hamas officials that met directly with Adam Bowler in those direct talks that took [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  place and was involved with the recent deal that resulted in the release of Edan Alexander, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=303.68s)]
*  an American citizen who served in the Israeli army and was taken prisoner by Palestinian fighters on [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=308.64s)]
*  October 7th while in an Israeli military uniform as an active-duty soldier. And I want to get to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=313.84s)]
*  his release in a moment, but let's go back, and I guess more broadly, how did you find him? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=325.52s)]
*  Because, you know, like you say, the perspective that we have on Hamas in this country is [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  they're designated a terrorist group by the United States, all its leaders are on the terrorist watch [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=344.23999999999995s)]
*  thing, and we are just told that it's impossible to have conversations, there's no, they want the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=352.4s)]
*  death of Palestinians, etc. etc. What was your perspective? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=358.0s)]
*  You know, when we launched DropSite News in July of 2024, we're coming up on one year of publishing [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=364.56s)]
*  at DropSite, the first stories that we did were a series of stories where I interviewed officials [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=370.88s)]
*  from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. You know, I've been working as a journalist in the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=376.0s)]
*  Middle East for much of my adult life and, you know, have contacts, and so, you know, the act of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=381.6s)]
*  like how do you get in touch with them was not necessarily the most, you know, difficult part of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  this, but we're operating in an environment where Donald Trump is clearly trying to expand the laws [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=394.24s)]
*  on what constitutes material support for terrorism, is going after non-profit news organizations, and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=401.92s)]
*  so when you try to do your job as a journalist and it involves talking to people who are [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=408.72s)]
*  designated by the U.S. State Department as terrorists, and I've interviewed multiple [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  people who are State Department designated, you know, then you really are committing an [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  act of journalism that this White House does not want you to engage in, which is ironic given that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  they're engaged in direct talks with literally with the very people that I was speaking with, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=428.64000000000004s)]
*  but, you know, I think that to put it in a broader historical context, Palestinians have been so [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=434.32s)]
*  broadly dehumanized and the Palestine exception is so ferocious and the portrayal of Hamas, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  we can have a discussion about what are Hamas's politics both locally in Gaza and, you know, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=449.12s)]
*  their broader view of the world, but to compare Hamas to ISIS or Hamas to Al-Qaeda is such a [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=454.4s)]
*  fallacy and a lie that it is risible, that it is utterly ridiculous. Hamas has never conducted [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=462.0s)]
*  an operation outside of the borders of historic Palestine, of what it considers to be the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=469.52s)]
*  territory that it is fighting to liberate. It's not going and blowing up aircraft. It's not attacking [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=474.88s)]
*  U.S. embassies abroad. In fact, I've had multiple Hamas officials say to me, we have no problem [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=480.4s)]
*  whatsoever with the United States outside of the context of its support for an apartheid [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=486.24s)]
*  colonial regime that is seeking to just permanently occupy us. So we should have an [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=490.64s)]
*  honest and open discussion about Hamas, but let's get the historical facts right. Let's set [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=495.52s)]
*  Palestinian armed resistance in a proper context. So I don't even bother to take on the lies or the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=500.47999999999996s)]
*  propaganda that is thrown at anyone who dares to speak with them because I think that you're then [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=507.68s)]
*  playing their game. Our readers, the viewers of this show, are smart enough, have independent [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=513.12s)]
*  enough minds where you can provide them with an opportunity to hear a voice and they make [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=518.96s)]
*  their own assessment of what they think of what that person is saying. Can you expand a little bit [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=523.84s)]
*  on that history of Hamas and how they differ from those other groups that you mentioned? Because [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=529.36s)]
*  frankly, that flattening is just Islamophobia that a lot of the Western press relies on [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=535.0400000000001s)]
*  because in part, there's no Western journalists in Gaza. Israel has blocked it and they're killing [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=540.32s)]
*  at a record pace the journalists that are in Gaza and they're basically saying that they're [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=547.36s)]
*  associated with Hamas so you can't trust them. It's a way to block out, I think, all information [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=552.48s)]
*  until they can continue the genocide. But there's this overall flattening of Hamas' role in Gaza [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=558.72s)]
*  where they are, in part, a governmental organization. They were, of course, involved in the October 7th [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=568.72s)]
*  attacks and orchestrated them. But what is their role in, or what has been their role, in society, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=575.76s)]
*  in Gaza? And how do those differentiations look? To back up a little bit before, a large segment [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=583.36s)]
*  of the Palestinian armed resistance prior to the 1980s was sort of secular and left-wing in [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  orientation. And some of the groups that form the core of the Palestine Liberation Organization or [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=600.72s)]
*  Palestinian resistance in the 60s and 70s are still very active and some of them as second-tier [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=606.96s)]
*  or second-wave participants also engaged in the October 7th operations that are known in Arabic [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=614.1600000000001s)]
*  as Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. And Hamas grew out of a transitional period where the Israelis really used [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=621.44s)]
*  extreme force against the Palestinian resistance in historic Palestine, exiled many of the leaders [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=630.16s)]
*  and activists who were part of these organizations to Lebanon and elsewhere. And in exiling them, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=636.7199999999999s)]
*  they had Palestinians in camps along with Lebanese resistance fighters, Iranian resistance [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=644.24s)]
*  fighters. You had the Muslim Brotherhood rising up in Egypt against the secular government in Cairo. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=649.68s)]
*  So you had these very heady times in the late 1970s, early 1980s, and then stretching to the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=657.9200000000001s)]
*  mid-1980s where all these ideas were swirling around among Palestinians of different factions [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  and you started to have a real discussion of what is the relationship between Islam as a religion [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=669.84s)]
*  and the politics of Palestinian liberation. And out of that discourse rose groups like Hamas, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=675.36s)]
*  which originally was sort of an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood but later became its [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  standalone entity quite quickly. And you had Palestinian Islamic Jihad as well. And so Hamas [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=686.7199999999999s)]
*  formed as an Islamic resistance movement that was combining Islamic principles with the traditional [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=693.36s)]
*  politics of Palestinian resistance. And it was very controversial in the 2006 elections in Palestine [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=700.8s)]
*  among Islamic resistance forces that Hamas decided to stand for the elections. And the leader of the [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  party at the time was Ismail Haneeh, who was assassinated last summer in Tehran, Iran, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=713.92s)]
*  by Israel when he went to attend the inauguration of the new Iranian president. Israel assassinated [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=721.28s)]
*  him. He was also the chief negotiator for the Palestinian side. So Hamas wins the elections. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  They defeat the preferred U.S. candidates not just in Gaza but in all Palestinian territories. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=733.12s)]
*  So Ismail Haneeh from Hamas, the Islamic resistance movement, was supposed to be, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=739.52s)]
*  according to the democratic process, the prime minister of Palestine. Well, the United States [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=744.56s)]
*  went and Israel of course went nuts about this. The U.S. and other western countries say we have [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=750.24s)]
*  to impose sanctions. The wrong people won the free and fair election. So Israel then imposes a [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=754.64s)]
*  blockade. And Hamas has a civil war in 2007 with Fatah, the party of Mahmoud Abbas, the 89-year-old [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=760.4s)]
*  head of the Palestinian Authority, whose popularity in Palestine is lower than Sam's, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=768.96s)]
*  as who wouldn't people want to be in charge of Palestine. Sorry, Sam. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  That's fair. Fair. Very fair. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=778.08s)]
*  There was a civil war. And essentially what happened is that Mahmoud Abbas consolidated [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  his control of the occupied West Bank and Fatah was the dominant political force there. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=786.96s)]
*  And then Hamas becomes the government and dominant political force of Gaza, even though roughly 50% [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=791.44s)]
*  of people in Gaza did not vote for Hamas. This is an important fact to remember. And if you look, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=798.4s)]
*  I've read opinion polls over the years. As a government, people had the same gripes about [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=802.72s)]
*  Hamas that people in New York have about trash collection or humans anywhere. We always have to [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=807.84s)]
*  remember this because it's never allowed. Palestinians have the same issues we have about [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=813.12s)]
*  their government. Not everything is, oh my God, do we want Hamas to be attacking Israel? Do we [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=816.72s)]
*  believe in armed resistance? Basic things, are we paid on time? Are people picking up the trash? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=821.52s)]
*  Are our schools okay? So those kind of governance issues, Hamas has had to deal with since 2006. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=826.4s)]
*  And because there have been no other elections allowed, Hamas has now just been the government [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=831.76s)]
*  for all this time without ever having to go to the ballot box again. And Israel is constantly [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=836.8s)]
*  bombing, tightening the siege in the lead up to October 7th. And from my conversations with [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=842.9599999999999s)]
*  people from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, they're watching a number of factors. They're watching [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=849.28s)]
*  the Saudis get closer to normalizing relations with Israel. They watched what happened under [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=853.92s)]
*  the first Trump administration. Israel was tightening the blockade even further. You had [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=858.4s)]
*  increased attacks against Al Aqsa Mosque, one of the holiest sites in Islam and the holiest site [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=863.36s)]
*  of Islam in historic Palestine. And you also had a lot of pressure internally in Gaza that the [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=868.64s)]
*  status quo was getting worse and worse, that things were crumbling. People were irritated [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=875.5999999999999s)]
*  with Hamas as a government. So all of these factors and a sense that there had to be a [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=880.48s)]
*  calling of the question on Israel or else the Palestinians would be subjected to a slow death [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=885.2s)]
*  led to the decision to launch the October 7th attacks. And so now we have a situation where [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=890.5600000000001s)]
*  Israel had a well-oiled propaganda machine. They come out of the gates and they're saying [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=898.24s)]
*  Hamas is Daesh, Hamas is ISIS, Hamas is Al Qaeda, Hamas is representing a threat to the entire world. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=903.52s)]
*  And the narrative was completely riddled with outright falsehoods and lies to manufacture the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=909.92s)]
*  consent for what would become the zenith moment of Netanyahu's career, which was always about [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  the annihilation of the Palestinians as a people and the removal of them from their land. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=922.64s)]
*  All right. I just want to fill in a couple of things because I think the misunderstanding is [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=927.12s)]
*  to what Hamas is, aside from how they've been designated by the United States as a terrorist [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=931.36s)]
*  organization, like you say, they've been in the business of trash collection, of governance. So [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=943.76s)]
*  I mean, there is a much broader portfolio they have than just being an armed militancy. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=952.8s)]
*  Should also say that my understanding, and I wonder, I don't know how much of this [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=962.64s)]
*  you've gotten into in these conversations, but I imagine over the years that the Muslim Brotherhood's [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=971.12s)]
*  perspective was essentially as a Reader's Digest version, that you start with a certain [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=976.56s)]
*  piousness as a Muslim and that will bring about liberation for the Palestinian people. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=985.92s)]
*  And Hamas inverted that and said, we first must liberate the Palestinian people and then [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=992.4s)]
*  we will be able to attain a certain level of piousness within the context of Islam. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1000.0s)]
*  Following the elections, and the elections, if I remember correctly, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1011.2s)]
*  and I think you and I were probably having conversations about Iraq at the time, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1014.4s)]
*  was a unilateral decision by the Israelis and to some extent with encouragement from the Bush [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1018.88s)]
*  administration because they thought that it would disempower Hamas. And the absolute wrong thing [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1028.8000000000002s)]
*  happened because the whole development of Hamas was helped by the Israelis to create a conflict [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1036.8000000000002s)]
*  within the Palestinian society so that there was no single voice in which they had to negotiate with. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1044.48s)]
*  So they could argue, we have no partner for peace because the Palestinian people can't [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1051.76s)]
*  even get on the same page. And that was why we saw the rise of a fatah at that moment because [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1058.0800000000002s)]
*  Israel sort of pumped the brakes and then did a fallback position. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1066.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot to unpack there. First, you're correct that we have to remember, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1073.6000000000001s)]
*  and it's so crazy that this is true, but Hamas is often spoken about as though they're foreigners [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1079.2s)]
*  that came into Gaza, as though the organization itself in all of its layers is not comprised of [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1085.52s)]
*  people that grew up in the concentration camp of Gaza themselves, whose families were expelled [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1093.44s)]
*  during the Nakba beginning in 1948, or that Palestinians view them as somehow separate from [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1098.8s)]
*  the fabric of Palestinian life or discourse. And Hamas primarily views itself as a national [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1104.8799999999999s)]
*  liberation movement. It doesn't primarily view itself as we're going to establish the caliphate. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1112.08s)]
*  Hamas is an Islamic resistance movement and the emphasis is on the word resistance. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1118.24s)]
*  And while everyone uses the word Hamas like it's Kleenex to describe every single group, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1122.96s)]
*  there were more than half a dozen armed factions that participated in one way or another [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1129.28s)]
*  in the October 7th attacks. And some of them are Christian in their religious confession, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1134.8s)]
*  some are Muslims, some are secular, some are religious. Hamas also has the Al Qassam Brigades, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1141.44s)]
*  which is its armed wing. And while there is influence from the political leadership of Hamas, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1148.0800000000002s)]
*  and so far when the political leadership has signed a ceasefire or a truce deal, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1154.72s)]
*  Al Qassam Brigades have respected that. But there is autonomy. There is quite a bit of evidence to [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1159.28s)]
*  suggest that most of Hamas's political leadership, with the exception of Yahya Senuar, the late [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1164.3200000000002s)]
*  political head of Hamas, who was widely believed to be the kind of intellectual mastermind of [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1170.4s)]
*  October 7th, that very few of the members of the political leadership of Hamas knew in advance that [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1176.24s)]
*  this was going to happen or when it was going to happen. I bring that up because the U.S. narrative [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1182.4s)]
*  is so often filled with oversimplifications or inaccuracies, not to mention the Israeli narrative, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1189.2s)]
*  which is outright propaganda and total lies. But the U.S. portrayal of Hamas as akin to ISIS is so [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1194.72s)]
*  far from the truth. And the fact of the matter is that armed resistance and the right to armed [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1201.76s)]
*  resistance remains one of the single highest policy positions among all Palestinians, not just [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1206.48s)]
*  in Gaza, but throughout the West Bank and those that live in what's called 48 territory, Palestinians [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1212.72s)]
*  who live within what currently constitutes the state of Israel. Can you speak a little bit more [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1218.16s)]
*  about that armed resistance and how the Abraham Accords, crossing over from the Trump administration [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1223.76s)]
*  to being continued under the Biden administration, affected Hamas's decision to stage the October 7th [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1231.92s)]
*  attacks? And if you could even put that even into further context into what their armed resistance [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1238.64s)]
*  is even capable of when you compare it to, say, the Israelis, you know, there's no Air Force, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1244.72s)]
*  their military capabilities are limited by design because of Israel's blockade. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1251.6000000000001s)]
*  But why Saudi normalization would be such a threat to them because of that complete [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1258.72s)]
*  gap in firepower, basically, with the Israelis? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1267.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, very, I mean, good questions. And I should say, you know, while I have interviewed [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1272.88s)]
*  many Hamas officials about the question that you're asking me, I don't feel like I have a [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1278.24s)]
*  clear enough sense of what the actual truth is. I can share with you vignettes or things that [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1284.88s)]
*  I've heard, but I want to make clear I'm not here offering the definitive history of Hamas's [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1290.72s)]
*  perspective or motivations for October 7th, but having said that, I'll share with you some of what [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1296.4s)]
*  I do understand. I think the issue of Saudi Arabia was this, that you had all of these, let's say, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1300.24s)]
*  lesser important countries to the geopolitical situation between Israel and Palestine that had [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1306.16s)]
*  normalized, that were not considered to be a huge problem for the Palestinians because it didn't, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1312.72s)]
*  they didn't really carry much weight. In the case of Saudi Arabia, this would be by far the most [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1319.44s)]
*  powerful economically and otherwise nation, Arab nation, to normalize with Israel since the decades [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1325.28s)]
*  ago when Egypt and Jordan both entered into their peace agreements with Israel. So if the Saudis were [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1332.56s)]
*  to normalize with Israel and to not insist that a Palestinian state be part of the deal, this would [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1340.48s)]
*  have been the most significant blow to the Palestinian cause delivered by the decisions [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1348.32s)]
*  of an Arab ruler in many, many decades. And I don't think we can understate how significant [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1352.72s)]
*  that would have been because the Saudis understand that both Israel and the United States desperately [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1358.32s)]
*  want Saudi Arabia to normalize with Israel. So if the Saudis were to take that off the table, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1364.48s)]
*  then you would essentially have an entirely incapacitated Arab, broader Arab nation with [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1371.6s)]
*  no ability whatsoever to influence the position of the United States, not to mention Israel. So I think [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1379.76s)]
*  in a nutshell, that's what I think was the issue there. It was more of a high-level [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1384.96s)]
*  political analysis. On the issue of the weapons though, Emma, let's remember that most of the [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1389.44s)]
*  weapons that Al Qassam brigades have and that Islamic Jihad have on the ground in Gaza are [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1396.24s)]
*  domestically manufactured by engineering corps that have been doing this for decades. They're [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1404.24s)]
*  manufacturing their own bullets. They're manufacturing their own sniper rifles. They're [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1410.48s)]
*  manufacturing their own rockets. They are taking the debris from munitions fired at Gaza by Israel [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1414.32s)]
*  and they are retrofitting them into their own weaponry. There's an old Al Jazeera documentary [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1419.92s)]
*  from 2006. It was an Al Jazeera Arabic. It's called Hosted by the Rifle. And it's a documentary where [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1426.72s)]
*  an Al Jazeera correspondent goes into Gaza and he interviews people from Al Qassam Brigades [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1434.08s)]
*  engineering corps and they show him the process of manufacturing their own grenades, their own [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1440.3999999999999s)]
*  rockets, their own rifles. And in that, he does an interview, the correspondent, with Mohammed [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1444.96s)]
*  Daif. Mohammed Daif was widely credited as being the Palestinian that modernized Al Qassam brigades [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1451.04s)]
*  into a fighting force capable of doing an operation like occurred on October 7th. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1460.4s)]
*  And so they have created factories in the tunnels for the manufacture of their own weapons, often [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1466.48s)]
*  using ordinance that Israel has fired at them and then repurposing it to create their own weaponry. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1473.52s)]
*  What happened on October 7th was in the context of Palestinian resistance, utterly spectacular. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1479.6000000000001s)]
*  Whatever you think about the actions, who was killed, how they were killed on October 7th, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1486.8s)]
*  what they managed to do was a total shock to the system, the national security system of Israel. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1493.84s)]
*  They were able to breach multiple Israeli military facilities with almost no resistance [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1500.1599999999999s)]
*  whatsoever and come away with upwards of 250 captives, including many dozens of Israeli [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1506.3999999999999s)]
*  soldiers, not to mention seizing computer hard drives, papers, and other intelligence [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1513.6s)]
*  from these Israeli bases and bring them back into Gaza with them. It was the most stunning [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1519.28s)]
*  and successful attack that any Palestinian resistance forces have ever launched against [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1525.12s)]
*  the state of Israel. And it was all planned in total secrecy using weapons that were overwhelmingly [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1531.52s)]
*  manufactured in the tunnels underneath Gaza. I want to move forward to this sort of where we've [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1539.12s)]
*  been this year, particularly under the Trump administration. And I want to go back to what [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1547.9199999999998s)]
*  was happening in March when the first sort of, it wasn't the first ceasefire, but it was what [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1553.1999999999998s)]
*  appeared to be the first sort of potentially extended one and process. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1563.04s)]
*  Just tell us about that. It is since the Israelis unilaterally ended that process, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1570.48s)]
*  but tell us what that process was and how it came about. And then I want to talk about [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1576.72s)]
*  a Bolart, Adam Bolart, who is the special hostage envoy for the United States. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1582.8s)]
*  All right. So rewind a little bit further back. In May of 2024, Joe Biden, who was president at [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1590.48s)]
*  the time, stands up in front of the American people at a press conference and says that there's a [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1596.24s)]
*  breakthrough on the verge that based on an Israeli idea that the Biden administration had come up with [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1600.8s)]
*  a framework for a ceasefire that it believed was going to be able to bring a resolution to the war [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1608.0s)]
*  in Gaza. And then Biden and his administration do not veto a UN resolution that happens. They were [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1613.52s)]
*  constantly vetoing all these ceasefire resolutions. They sit this one out. They let the United [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1621.44s)]
*  Nations endorse what Biden at this point then was calling the Biden proposal. They go back to Hamas [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1625.44s)]
*  and Israel. There's a little bit of back and forth. July 2nd, 2024, Hamas formally signs with the [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1630.96s)]
*  mediators a commitment to enter into a three phase ceasefire deal with Israel that was based on what [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1636.72s)]
*  Joe Biden called the Biden plan. Israel then proceeds to blow that deal up and totally [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1642.72s)]
*  humiliate Biden. And instead of putting any consequences on Netanyahu, Biden continues the [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1649.04s)]
*  flow of weapons and then nothing ever happens again. Trump again emerges as, you know, he quite [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1653.84s)]
*  likely is going to win. He starts saying on the campaign trail that, you know, within hours of [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1660.16s)]
*  getting into office, he's going to end the war. Then once he becomes the president elect, he [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1664.64s)]
*  starts threatening and says, you know, mostly he was saying to Hamas, but it was clear it meant [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1668.72s)]
*  both sides that if there isn't a deal before I'm sworn in and hostages don't start coming home, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1672.56s)]
*  there's going to be all hell to pay. That actually meant something. So you then had Steve Witkoff, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1678.88s)]
*  a golf billionaire buddy of Donald Trump's, get signed on during the transition to be Trump's [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1683.76s)]
*  envoy. He starts attending these negotiations with the regional mediators from Qatar and Egypt [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1689.28s)]
*  alongside the outgoing Biden administration team. And there's a famous story where Witkoff basically [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1694.72s)]
*  says he's going to fly into Israel, even though it's Shabbat, and Netanyahu's people are saying, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1700.48s)]
*  well, he can't meet you on this day. And Witkoff is saying, no, you are going to meet me on that [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1705.1200000000001s)]
*  day. By all accounts, it's quite clear from Hamas's side and Israel's side, had Trump not been [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1708.96s)]
*  elected, that ceasefire wouldn't have happened. But what's interesting is that the terms of the [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1716.32s)]
*  ceasefire signed on January 17th of this year, three days before Trump gets sworn in, was almost [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1722.08s)]
*  to the letter identical to the May proposal that Joe Biden had put forward. So there was nothing [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1727.76s)]
*  that changed except for the political pressure that was placed on Netanyahu by someone who wasn't even [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1733.76s)]
*  the president yet in Donald Trump. Netanyahu, though, Sam, starts saying, yeah, we signed this [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1741.6s)]
*  three-phase deal, but actually we're only going to respect the first phase of it. And actually, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1748.88s)]
*  we're not going to fully respect the first phase of it because we're going to still keep bombing [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1753.44s)]
*  them during the ceasefire, but we're going to go through the motions and try to get as many Israeli [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1756.5600000000002s)]
*  captives out as we can. So for a month, that's what happened. You had these exchanges where [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1760.24s)]
*  the Palestinian side was giving over Israelis. The Israelis would then release a large number of, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1764.88s)]
*  at the beginning, it was Palestinian children and women. There are 10,000 Palestinians that [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1770.4s)]
*  Palestinians consider to be hostages that Israel is holding. 2,000 Palestinians have been taken [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1775.44s)]
*  from Gaza just for the purpose of exchanging them in these deals. So as it's moving along, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1780.4s)]
*  a couple of weeks into that first 42-day phase, Israel is supposed to send technical negotiators [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1785.68s)]
*  who are going to work out the details of the second 42-day phase. That second 42-day phase [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1790.96s)]
*  stipulated all Israeli forces are out of Gaza. All remaining Israeli captives are freed. Netanyahu [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1797.3600000000001s)]
*  had said, I'm not going to do this. He told Trump he's not going to do it. He told Biden he's not [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1803.52s)]
*  going to do it. Biden and Trump both gave him what are called side letters saying if Israel decides [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1807.36s)]
*  it's not in its best interest, it can continue the war. March 1st comes, end of phase one. Israel [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1811.84s)]
*  makes clear it's not moving toward a phase two. March 2nd, they impose a full blockade, not an [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1816.8799999999999s)]
*  ounce of water, not a grain of wheat, no pill of medicine. Nothing will enter Gaza. By the way, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1821.84s)]
*  it's still that. It's been over two months now. Right. So then, Witkoff, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1827.2s)]
*  and Bowler start kicking into gear because they start to get concerned that if Netanyahu just [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1833.68s)]
*  continues to go full scorched earth, that Trump's other agenda in the Middle East is going to be [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1839.92s)]
*  messed with. None of this is actually about the Palestinian people. It's about two things, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1845.44s)]
*  getting the Israeli and the US citizen captives out of Gaza, whether living or dead, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1851.04s)]
*  and bringing this to some resolution so Trump can go out about the business of the Trump family [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1857.28s)]
*  business and a little bit for the United States in the Middle East. Let's be really clear that's [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1861.44s)]
*  what's going on. But Witkoff and Bowler then start saying we should talk directly to Hamas. We have [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1865.44s)]
*  our own citizens there. Netanyahu's plan seems to be that it's okay if captives keep dying. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1871.76s)]
*  So they open a direct channel. Adam Bowler, by the way, is one of Jared Kushner's college roommates [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1879.1200000000001s)]
*  and a very close friend of Jared Kushner, the son-in-law. By the way, when I spoke to Hamas [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1884.0s)]
*  officials about it, they were saying to me, oh, did you see how Adam Bowler got smeared? But then [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1888.24s)]
*  he was brought back into Trump. Why do you think that is? They were asking me. And I'm like, you [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1893.28s)]
*  guys don't know? Like you have an intelligence wing? This is a friend of Jared Kushner's. Like [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1897.2s)]
*  he's a personal friend of the Trump family. You guys are following me here. That's what they said. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1901.52s)]
*  They send Jared Kushner's frat buddy to be the guy directly meeting with Hamas. So you've got his [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1905.28s)]
*  golf buddy, Witkoff, and his son-in-law's college roommate are the lead negotiators now with Hamas. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1912.16s)]
*  And the irony is there's probably a finder's fee for whatever deal ends up coming in. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1920.24s)]
*  I mean, there's total speculation, but we just saw the Qataris offering a $400 million plane. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1928.5600000000002s)]
*  Who knows what deal down the road they think is going to come out of this? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1936.16s)]
*  But I want to take this moment. So Bowler goes and has a conversation with Hamas, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1940.32s)]
*  and it creates a huge... And he goes around the Israelis. And this is how he is met. This is on [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1946.8799999999999s)]
*  March 9th. Let's just start with Jake Tapper's introduction of Bowler. I found this fascinating [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1953.2s)]
*  because I had seen it contemporaneously, but after listening to your interview, I went back. And it's [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1959.84s)]
*  fascinating to see how Tapper introduces this guy. Joining me now is the man who sat across the [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1966.88s)]
*  proverbial table from Hamas, U.S. hostage envoy Adam Bowler. Adam, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1974.96s)]
*  Let's start on these direct negotiations with Hamas. First of all, obviously controversial to [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1981.1200000000001s)]
*  directly negotiate with terrorists. How much sign-off did you get from President Trump beforehand? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1987.44s)]
*  And this is just my personal curiosity. As a Jewish American, did you have to steal yourself [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1992.8s)]
*  before sitting down to deal with people who are definitionally anti-Semitic murderers? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=1999.44s)]
*  Well, I'll say meeting with... Okay. So I just wanted to just... [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2006.32s)]
*  Yeah. They are not definitionally anti-Semitic murderers. I want to get to the rest of the [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2010.1599999999999s)]
*  Bowler, but speak, because I know that you asked Hamdan about what is the basis of this resistance [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2018.56s)]
*  movement. Do you hate... I don't know if you asked specifically, do you hate Jews, but he addressed [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2026.6399999999999s)]
*  this. I don't ask that because I'm not a child. I'm a student of history. And look, since 2017, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2032.08s)]
*  the Hamas Charter has stated quite explicitly that the official position of Hamas is that it [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2041.76s)]
*  will accept a two-state arrangement with Israel along the pre-June 4th, 1967 borders with East [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2047.76s)]
*  Jerusalem as its capital. That's been the position since 2017. What people like Jake Tapper and [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2055.04s)]
*  others who make these claims rely on is a combination of having swallowed far too much [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2061.44s)]
*  Israeli propaganda and statements that have been made over the years about Jewish people by various [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2067.28s)]
*  people affiliated with Hamas, that Hamas itself doesn't deny. And if you actually pay attention [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2075.44s)]
*  to what they say, there have been several Hamas officials, including Abu Barzuk, one of the most [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2080.96s)]
*  senior officials in Hamas in a recent court filing in Britain, acknowledging that there were things [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2085.6s)]
*  said that don't reflect the views of the organization. You can take that or leave it, but Tapper is [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2090.88s)]
*  engaged in reckless, irresponsible, erroneous journalism when he poses a question like that to [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2095.6s)]
*  Adam Bowler. It's amazing that that's also the first question too. No, but this is typical. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2103.36s)]
*  I mean, Jake Tapper has been, unfortunately, I used to have respect for Jake Tapper during Obama, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2108.4s)]
*  when it was drone war stuff, Jake Tapper would ask good questions. Jake Tapper totally checked [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2113.52s)]
*  his principles at the door on October 7th when it came to covering this. He's been a rabid partisan. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2118.88s)]
*  He's been part of a media operation that has normalized and facilitated this genocide. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2124.7200000000003s)]
*  These people are not journalists. They have been propagandists in a very dark way for a U.S. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2131.52s)]
*  facilitated genocide. I think we just have to say that very, very clearly. They have had people on [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2138.08s)]
*  that have said demonstrably false things about events that took place on October 7th, and they [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2143.3599999999997s)]
*  have never, ever retracted it, nor has the New York Times. And Jake Tapper was part of that lie [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2147.6s)]
*  machine that was meant to dehumanize Palestinians. But on the issue of Adam Bowler, they then have [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2153.04s)]
*  Adam Bowler sitting there. I talked to Hamas. They found Bowler fascinating. They said that he [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2158.24s)]
*  was inquisitive, that he wanted to understand not just the events of October 7th and forward, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2164.3999999999996s)]
*  but wanted to go back. He asked them about the foundation of Hamas, about their views on a wide [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2169.6s)]
*  range of issues. They felt like it was a very, very productive meeting. And they said, they told me, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2173.7599999999998s)]
*  that Bowler kept saying that he really was surprised at what he was hearing in the room, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2179.3599999999997s)]
*  that it's so different from what he had been told was going to be said in that room, and kept [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2185.04s)]
*  emphasizing that to them. And they told me something that hasn't been made public. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2189.68s)]
*  What Bowler told them is that the next step in this is going to be, we're going to set up a [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2194.48s)]
*  direct meeting between Hamas and Steve Witkoff, and we're going to discuss a much broader framework. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2198.32s)]
*  And what Hamas was just stunned to see was Adam Bowler not just going on CNN, but going on Israeli [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2204.72s)]
*  television and stating that Hamas has put forward a proposal for a long-term truce of five to ten [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2211.44s)]
*  years with Israel. So Adam Bowler, who is the special envoy on hostages for Trump, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2219.36s)]
*  and college roommate of Jared Kushner, goes in, meets with Hamas, the first time there's been [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2227.6s)]
*  direct talks between the American government and Hamas, and comes out of it with clearly a much [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2232.16s)]
*  more nuanced understanding, which is what you need in diplomacy, where Antony Blinken and others [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2237.84s)]
*  failed. Somehow this guy kind of gets it and comes out and accurately says, this is what the position [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2243.6000000000004s)]
*  is of Hamas. It was an extraordinary moment. Whatever the motivations are of Trump and company [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2251.04s)]
*  beyond it, from the position of Hamas, they're saying, look, we didn't know any, we've never [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2257.2000000000003s)]
*  heard of this guy before, but he seemed interested in actually what we think. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2260.8s)]
*  What's your read on that, Jeremy? What's your read on that? Just the idea that he's not a part [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2264.72s)]
*  of the national security kind of establishment, WestExec group. He is basically a health care, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2269.4399999999996s)]
*  like VC type of person. But I just think like there's something really important to underline [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2277.4399999999996s)]
*  there. The rot at the core of the national security consultant class that basically was running the [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2283.3599999999997s)]
*  show for Biden who couldn't put string two sentences together, they begin to believe their [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2291.12s)]
*  own BS or whatever they're spewing to the public is so disconnected from the reality that you have [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2297.92s)]
*  Sigma Chi bro come in and just have some common sense reaction. There's two elements that I think [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2305.12s)]
*  are really important to kind of flesh out is that one, these people maybe have more of a layman's [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2312.08s)]
*  kind of reaction to what's happening here. And two, Trump has this transactional element to him [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2319.28s)]
*  where there's some hope here in the sense that, you know, he has these Arab Americans for Trump [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2325.6800000000003s)]
*  that reportedly maybe made some connection. I take Barack Ravids reporting with a boulder of salt, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2331.52s)]
*  but I'm just trying to say that like, I want to get there soon. But just that the, with the [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2336.5600000000004s)]
*  Qatari plane and everything like that, Trump may be wanting to look at this from a business, you [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2342.48s)]
*  scratch my back thing as opposed to an ideological Zionist perspective, where maybe we do have a shift [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2347.44s)]
*  there. I mean, you guys remember that movie from, I mean, we're all relatively similar generation, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2354.4s)]
*  that movie Dave, where the guy who looks like the guy who looks like the president becomes president [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2360.56s)]
*  when the president becomes incapacitated. And then he has his friend, his personal accountant comes to [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2366.48s)]
*  the White House and balances the budget. It was like, I think it was a 90s movie. In a way, I get [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2370.64s)]
*  some bad news for you about everybody in this office except for me, but in terms of like being [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2375.12s)]
*  aware of anything in the 90s, but go ahead. All right. All right. My apologies. I'm trying to be [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2379.68s)]
*  generous toward you, Sam, but it's okay. No, no, me. That's that was late in my life. I said relatively, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2384.48s)]
*  which was sort of, I was talking about these guys are too young for that. They don't remember. Maybe Emma's [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2390.64s)]
*  parents told her about this movie. It's going to be a totally embarrassing moment for me. I apologize. I've outed myself, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2394.96s)]
*  but it's a movie basically about what happens if a normal person is put in charge of the United States [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2400.72s)]
*  and has to figure out like the problems of the day. And in a way, if like ordinary common sense people [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2406.0s)]
*  sit in a room and they're sort of listening, they come up with a different set of ideas than the class [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2411.8399999999997s)]
*  of people that Emma's referring to. The people that are paid by the makers of tanks to think, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2417.2s)]
*  you know, like that go in and out of government and think tank world, like the Blinkens of the [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2422.24s)]
*  world, you know, or the consulting world or whatever. Let's listen to two minutes of this, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2426.8s)]
*  of Bowler, because this comes out in these two minutes or so when he's talking to Jake [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2431.04s)]
*  Tapper. Now, of course, in the days after this interview, Bowler was attacked and these [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2436.32s)]
*  really go nuts and Republican senators then start to say to Trump, you know, we want him gone. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2442.5600000000004s)]
*  And it seemed like they were going to kick him under the bus. But then Trump was like, no, actually. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2447.92s)]
*  And while we're talking, Bowler's on his way to go. And that's, I want to get to that. But let's look [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2452.0s)]
*  at this clip. This is from again, from March 9th, that same interview. Situation. I do think [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2456.32s)]
*  there's hope. I think that Israel has done a wonderful, masterful job eliminating Habas, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2461.28s)]
*  Hezbollah, a number of other enemies in the state that makes things possible that were [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2468.0800000000004s)]
*  impossible before. And I think you could see something like a long-term truce where we forgive [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2473.36s)]
*  prisoners, where Hamas lays down their arms, where they agree they're not part of the political party [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2479.2000000000003s)]
*  going forward. I think that's a reality. It's real close. Do you have plans to sit down with Hamas again? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2485.12s)]
*  You never know. You know, sometimes you're in the area and you drop by. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2493.44s)]
*  All right. It's a very unique pop in. We got to go back. I want to get to the part where [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2498.88s)]
*  the Israelis were upset. Maybe it was a little bit earlier than this. I'm sorry. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2504.16s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry. I don't know. To help other Americans. And so it comes part and [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2508.7999999999997s)]
*  parcel of the job. I knew that I was going to meet Hamas as a result of it and we discussed it. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2514.88s)]
*  Then I think when you walk and you sit in front of somebody and you know what they've done, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2521.04s)]
*  it's hard not to think of it. I wouldn't say it's the most productive. The most productive is to [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2528.6400000000003s)]
*  realize that every piece of a person is a human and to identify with the human elements of those [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2534.08s)]
*  people and then build from there. But it definitely feels a little odd knowing what they really are. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2539.6s)]
*  So thank you for your candor. So you did get sign off from President Trump ahead of time, though? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2547.7599999999998s)]
*  Of course. Yeah. What was the result of the meeting? How close are you to a deal to get [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2553.2799999999997s)]
*  the American hostages living and dead, murdered? I guess I jump forward again. I'm sorry. I just [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2558.4s)]
*  jump forward to the Ron Dermer part. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. That's a very unique pop in, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2564.96s)]
*  I suppose. So you talked about the job Israel has done in trying to negotiate the release of [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2573.76s)]
*  the hostages living and dead. Axios's reporter, Barak Ravid, is reporting the top Israeli official, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2581.6s)]
*  Ron Dermer, strongly discouraged you from talking directly with Hamas. He said it was a tense phone [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2587.6s)]
*  call. Tell us about that. Do you understand why Netanyahu, Dermer, others might be upset? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2592.88s)]
*  I do understand. I spoke with Ron and I'm sympathetic. He has someone that he doesn't [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2599.6800000000003s)]
*  know well, making direct contact with Hamas. Maybe I would see them and say, look, they don't [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2605.84s)]
*  have horns growing out of their head. They're actually guys like us. They're pretty nice guys. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2611.36s)]
*  So he doesn't know me. And there are big stakes. He lives in a country where if it sets certain [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2616.4s)]
*  precedents, then it will hurt or help a lot of other people. So I understand the consternation [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2622.48s)]
*  and the concern and I wasn't upset. At the same time, we're the United States. We're not an agent [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2628.2400000000002s)]
*  of Israel. We have specific interests at play. And we did communicate back and forth. We had very [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2635.12s)]
*  specific parameters by which we fell. And the reality is what I wanted to do is jumpstart some [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2641.84s)]
*  negotiations that were in a very fragile place. And I wanted to say to Hamas, what is the end [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2647.84s)]
*  game that you want here? Not the dream end game. But what do you think is realistic at this point? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2654.0s)]
*  Because until we know that, it's very hard to reach some sort of truce or some sort of end [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2659.76s)]
*  to hostility. So in the end, I think it was a very helpful meeting. It was very helpful to hear [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2665.92s)]
*  some back and forth. But I think Israel knows walking out of that, it's not like Hamas got the [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2672.88s)]
*  world because I thought they were a bunch of nice guys. Right. All right. I mean, that's fascinating [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2678.6400000000003s)]
*  because first of all, you never heard an American official talk like that. And he is obviously [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2684.0800000000004s)]
*  he's being very diplomatic. But what he's saying is they don't have horns. I could have [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2691.2000000000003s)]
*  conversations with these guys. They have an agenda. They have an end game as well. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2698.32s)]
*  What is subsequent to that? I mean, that moment I found fascinating and the Israelis really, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2703.44s)]
*  I mean, sort of tip their hand here. You can't go and talk to them because we have a narrative [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2712.88s)]
*  that we're trying to control. And you're usurping that narrative. But I mean, this is the thing. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2718.0800000000004s)]
*  I am totally clear on who Donald Trump is. And I think Hamas is very clear on what Donald Trump [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2724.96s)]
*  is regarding Israel. They understand that this administration is just completely filled with [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2732.5600000000004s)]
*  Zionists. They understand that the appointment of Mike Huckabee, a fanatical Christian supremacist [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2736.88s)]
*  lunatic, is now the U.S. ambassador to Israel. They know that Trump may well tell Netanyahu, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2741.6000000000004s)]
*  they're clear on all of that. But where they see opportunity is in the form of Trump's unorthodox [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2749.6s)]
*  nature, the fact that there is really open corruption in this administration, that Trump [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2758.2400000000002s)]
*  wants to make a bunch of deals with Arab nations that actually want this war to end, that it's in [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2763.12s)]
*  play in a way it never would have been when you have a ghoulish 50-year radical Zionist like Joe [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2768.88s)]
*  Biden in the White House who spent his entire career supporting Israel at its most violent and [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2775.92s)]
*  most extreme. From their perspective, it's like these guys are kind of normal people. They said [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2780.96s)]
*  the same thing about Adam Boller that he's saying about them, that we actually find them reasonable [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2785.76s)]
*  to deal with. They don't believe they're going to get the farm from Donald Trump. They want what [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2790.96s)]
*  they feel is a fair shot. And they think they have a better chance of getting it with Boller [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2794.7200000000003s)]
*  and Witkoff. I mean, we are now in a situation, it's so pathetic and also amusing at the same [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2798.96s)]
*  time, that the best hope we have maybe for some end to this genocide is that Donald Trump's [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2805.76s)]
*  unorthodox way of approaching things, the people that he's put in charge of these negotiations not [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2811.84s)]
*  being professional politicians from the consultancy class, and Trump's corruption and prioritization [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2817.36s)]
*  beyond just supporting Zionism could end up ending this thing. This is so crazy that that's true. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2824.6400000000003s)]
*  Trump believes in one thing, and that is how much is going to be put into his pocket. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2830.88s)]
*  At the very least, if you know there's something transactional, then there's perhaps a transaction [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2839.92s)]
*  that can happen. Bring it to today. We have a situation where subsequent to that, that [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2847.28s)]
*  hostage, that prisoner was released and they were supposed to go to Qatar and meet Trump there. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2854.24s)]
*  Qatar, meanwhile, has given for, like what's going on now, and this involves Saudi Arabia too, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2863.6s)]
*  from your perspective and from what you gleaned, what is going on right now? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2870.3999999999996s)]
*  What happened is that since those meetings with Boller, Hamas has said that they're interested [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2876.8799999999997s)]
*  in freeing Edan Alexander, this kid from New Jersey who joined the Israeli military and was [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2881.44s)]
*  captured by Palestinian fighters in Israeli military uniform. I keep repeating that because [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2888.0s)]
*  people say it's a hostage as though he was one of the people taken from the music festival [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2892.96s)]
*  when he was actually a combatant in the Israeli military. Hamas originally wanted to make that [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2896.96s)]
*  part of a deal that brought them back to the original framework that contemplates full Israeli [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2902.48s)]
*  withdrawal and an end to the genocide. I think that what the calculus from Hamas' perspective is [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2907.36s)]
*  we're taking a gamble here. We're going to release the only male soldier that we've released since [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2914.56s)]
*  October 7, 2023 to the United States for nothing on paper and nothing in return in terms of a [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2919.92s)]
*  guarantee or a stamp on it. What their perspective is, is that Trump's, and I think that Trump's [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2926.96s)]
*  people indicated to Hamas in these discussions that they intend to put a lot of pressure on Net [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2932.48s)]
*  and Yahoo. Whether or not that's going to pan out, it's a huge gamble from Hamas' perspective. The [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2938.08s)]
*  only card, so to speak, that they have is the captives that they're holding. Every time they [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2943.12s)]
*  release a captive to Israel or in this case, the United States, their bargaining power gets reduced. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2948.0s)]
*  That's how they think of this, that if they didn't hold those captives, then there would be nothing [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2954.72s)]
*  to encourage the United States or any other country to put pressure on Israel. So we're in [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2960.24s)]
*  that situation. Trump, though, is in the Middle East wanting money, wanting to make deals. This [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2964.9599999999996s)]
*  has nothing to do with Net and Yahoo. He wants to make that money. And when making that money comes [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2971.52s)]
*  into conflict because Net and Yahoo is intent on just continuing his genocide, in the case of [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2977.68s)]
*  someone like Biden, no problem. In the case of someone like Trump, you're messing with my money. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2983.52s)]
*  I think that's really, to put it in just kind of the most basic human terms, I think that is part [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2988.08s)]
*  of what we're seeing here. Regarding Qatar, it's interesting. Qatar is on the one hand at the center [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2992.72s)]
*  of a huge scandal, Qatar gate for Net and Yahoo right now internally in Israel. Qatar also has [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=2998.08s)]
*  close diplomatic relations with Hamas. It also has relations with Israel and regularly meets with [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3005.2s)]
*  Israeli intelligence and has been one of the primary mediators in these negotiations over the [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3011.76s)]
*  Gaza War. But beyond that, Qatar wants to make a play to be viewed as the kind of logical American [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3016.96s)]
*  diplomatic ally in the Middle East and a close business partner of the American capitalist class. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3023.76s)]
*  So that is Qatar's view. And the airplane thing, you know, you wouldn't give that airplane to Joe [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3029.36s)]
*  Biden. You would do other deals with Joe Biden. But that's the language of Donald Trump. So from [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3035.6s)]
*  the Qataris' perspective, they're like, OK, well, these are the rules of the game. The Trumps people [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3040.0s)]
*  say it's legal. Here you go. Here's your $400 million luxury jet, you know, luxury plane. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3043.6s)]
*  The other language of Donald Trump was hinted in this clip here where he said at the end, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3048.72s)]
*  we're America. Or I'm paraphrasing it to a certain degree. Where, yeah, exactly. Where there's this [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3055.2799999999997s)]
*  discomfort with Israel, with the tail wagging the dog to an extent here. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3063.68s)]
*  You're right. I think Trump doesn't like Netanyahu at all. I mean, there's now Fox News is [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3068.9599999999996s)]
*  reporting that. Yeah. Yeah. I think he finds him a tacky, annoying person he just has to deal with. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3074.9599999999996s)]
*  Separate Netanyahu from Israel and the fact that Trump's primary, you know, his top benefactor, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3082.3199999999997s)]
*  Miriam Adelson, you know, $100 million. He has to kind of do her bidding to an extent. But I think [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3088.0s)]
*  there's a lot of evidence to suggest that Trump finds Netanyahu garish, annoying, doesn't want him [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3095.12s)]
*  around, probably doesn't like how he dresses or whatever. You know, like he finds him, doesn't [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3100.32s)]
*  like the way he chooses food. Those things actually matter in Trump world. And weirdly, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3104.32s)]
*  there are indications that Trump sort of likes Mahmoud Abbas, even though most Palestinians don't [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3109.52s)]
*  like Mahmoud Abbas. So one thing to look out for here is that Abbas, who is technically kind of [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3114.08s)]
*  in control of Palestine because he's the head of the Palestinian Authority, there may be meetings [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3119.52s)]
*  with Trump in these days involving Abbas. And I wouldn't be surprised if we started to hear [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3124.32s)]
*  that Trump's people want to make a deal involving Mahmoud Abbas to resolve the war in Gaza. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3130.0800000000004s)]
*  You know, and that could be that he goes behind the back of both Israel and kind of Hamas to just [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3137.04s)]
*  sort of say, here's what we're doing. But Emma, you're hitting it on the head. Trump is an American [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3141.76s)]
*  nationalist in his own imagination and America first. And I don't think he has any problems [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3146.1600000000003s)]
*  saying to Netanyahu, we don't take orders from you. And that's not something that Democratic [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3151.36s)]
*  presidents typically say. Yeah, he's not going to Jerusalem. And the fact that this IDF soldier was [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3156.1600000000003s)]
*  an American, I think is really key to his conception of himself as an American nationalist, that he [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3162.4s)]
*  went around the Israelis. And in terms of what Hamas got in exchange for it, they got the good [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3168.7200000000003s)]
*  ear of Donald Trump for they got to say, we made a deal with you, we scratch your back. So you get [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3174.8s)]
*  you have to scratch ours in the way that this Arab Americans for Trump story is kind of [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3180.4s)]
*  recirculating here where there's one thing Trump is transactional. He put RFK in his Health and [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3185.36s)]
*  Human Services Secretary when everyone thinks he's a crank because he felt that he delivered a [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3191.04s)]
*  specific coalition for him in the election. And I think that's where we're at here where Trump does [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3195.84s)]
*  feel like there's some transactional value in going around the Israelis from his from a political [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3202.48s)]
*  perspective. And that is where we may have an opportunity in my view. But remember, remember [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3208.24s)]
*  the backdrop of all of this that we've seen, which is totally extraordinary. Trump designates within [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3214.24s)]
*  days or a couple of weeks of coming back to the presidency, he designates Ansar Allah, the Houthis [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3219.8399999999997s)]
*  in Yemen as a full foreign terrorist organization. Joe Biden had walked that back a bit because they [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3224.9599999999996s)]
*  thought that there could be some diplomatic resolution. So Trump does that designation. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3230.7999999999997s)]
*  But then the US starts doing this heavy bombing of Yemen. And you have the Pete [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3234.8s)]
*  Hegsatz signal scandal, etc. And the fact is that the truth is that Ansar Allah was actually [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3240.2400000000002s)]
*  sticking it to the United States. They shot down record numbers of American drones. The US could [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3246.6400000000003s)]
*  not. This is a mountainous terrain. I've spent a good bit of time in Yemen. It is almost impossible [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3251.44s)]
*  for the United States to destroy their missile production capability. They tried repeatedly, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3257.2000000000003s)]
*  and they just couldn't do it. So eventually, Trump's people recognize this isn't in our [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3261.68s)]
*  interest. They make a sign a ceasefire deal with Ansar Allah, a foreign terrorist organization that [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3267.68s)]
*  Trump designated as one of the first foreign policy moves he made coming back into the White [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3274.96s)]
*  House. They make this deal brokered by Oman, and they cut Israel out of it. Do people understand [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3279.3599999999997s)]
*  what this means? They are answer a lot is saying we will not attack American ships anymore, but [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3284.8799999999997s)]
*  we're going to continue to bomb Israel. Yes, we're going to continue to attack Israeli ships. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3290.8s)]
*  That's the deal Donald Trump made his base. Some of his base. They're losing their minds over this. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3294.48s)]
*  Netanyahu is losing his mind over this that Trump made that deal. Trump is now negotiating directly [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3300.0800000000004s)]
*  with Iran. Now Trump blew up, you know, the best deal that that we had to try to ward off any kind [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3306.5600000000004s)]
*  of war with Iran that was signed under the Obama administration. And he may take us back to almost [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3312.48s)]
*  identical to what Obama had negotiated. But setting that aside and let you know recognizing [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3317.68s)]
*  there's ego at play, it's extraordinary. The Israelis don't want him doing this with Iran. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3323.6s)]
*  The Israelis have always played a huge role in dictating American policy on Iran. They certainly [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3327.8399999999997s)]
*  didn't want them signing a ceasefire agreement with Ansar Allah. They certainly didn't want Adam [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3332.0s)]
*  Bowler and Steve Witkoff to be talking directly with Hamas. So whatever anybody thinks about [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3335.7599999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump in the whole scope of American Empire, there maybe is a better shake for some [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3340.96s)]
*  of these things under these guys, golf buddies and college roommates than there was under the [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3347.12s)]
*  professional adults in the room that we were told were the answer to our problems. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3351.92s)]
*  Witkoff was just in the news in Jerusalem Post reporting that he had a meeting with the hostage [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3356.16s)]
*  families and Witkoff said we want to bring the hostages home but Israel not willing to end the war. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3365.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean and the families of those Israeli captives said to Steve Witkoff in that meeting, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3372.32s)]
*  Sam, that what you're saying is something that Netanyahu will never say to us. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3377.92s)]
*  You know that we don't hear this from Netanyahu. That those families believe, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3383.6s)]
*  and I think rightly so, that Netanyahu has prioritized the extermination of Palestinian [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3388.8s)]
*  women and kids in tents with US weapons over the freeing of their own people. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3393.76s)]
*  Witkoff and Boller, they know the truth and the truth is that Hamas is ready this moment [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3400.7200000000003s)]
*  to make a deal that releases every single captive immediately. That's the deal on the [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3405.76s)]
*  table from Hamas' perspective and Netanyahu has been blowing it up. And that involves a five to [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3410.96s)]
*  seven year truce where there would be, you know, and they would give up their leverage essentially [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3415.76s)]
*  with really no way of assuring that outside of this type of commitment. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3425.28s)]
*  All right, last question is I know you got to go. Saudi Arabia, like where are they? Because they [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3430.96s)]
*  were about to sign these accords. It seemed like Biden was en route to that. They now seem to have [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3437.84s)]
*  like, not necessarily recommitted, but they seem to be more, they're paying attention more to the [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3445.28s)]
*  situation in Gaza. I would imagine that's a function of domestic and sort of pan Arab [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3453.92s)]
*  pressures. Where, like what is it that MBS needs? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3461.52s)]
*  I actually think the Saudis have benefited from this situation tremendously because [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3468.48s)]
*  normalization with Israel is incredibly unpopular among Arab populations. You know, these rulers [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3475.12s)]
*  have been engaging in these deals. There's unrest that's brewing. It's not that there's going to be, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3482.88s)]
*  you know, that the Saudi kingdom is going to fall tomorrow or that the King of Jordan is going to [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3487.04s)]
*  fall, but there's an anger brewing in the streets. There's a resentment of these kinds of deals, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3490.8s)]
*  especially as people have watched the incineration of tens of thousands of Palestinians over these [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3496.2400000000002s)]
*  19 months. And the Saudis were under an enormous amount of pressure not to normalize with Israel, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3502.64s)]
*  just based on broader Arab public opinion. So Netanyahu doing the, you know, the Gaza genocide [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3509.04s)]
*  and mass murdering Palestinians and blowing up all of these deals and then having Trump come back [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3515.52s)]
*  into power, I think the Saudis sat back and they said, wait a minute, we don't have to talk about [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3521.44s)]
*  normalizing with Israel right now because Israel is committing a genocide. The U.S. is facilitating [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3526.0s)]
*  that genocide. We have Trump coming back in who was asking us for a trillion dollars, who wants [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvt6XUSOkc&t=3530.88s)]
