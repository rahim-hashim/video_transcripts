Annelle Sheline, a research fellow in the Quincy Institute’s Middle East program who’s latest paper focuses on the U.S.’s prioritization of weapons sales over human rights. Annelle gets into some of the thinking of her state department colleagues over this issue, which she finds to be rooted in outdated American exceptionalism. The hypocrisy is particularly noteworthy when it comes to Israel, despite growing public sentiment against Israel’s destruction of Gaza and perpetual subjugation of the Palestinian people.

# Biden Built The Framework For Trump's Gaza Brutality
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU)
*  We are back and we are joined once again by friend of the show Dr. Anel Shieline, research [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=0.0s)]
*  fellow in the Middle East program at the Quincy Institute. Anel was also at the State Department [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=4.72s)]
*  under Biden and resigned over the administration's support for the Gaza genocide. Her brief in Quincy, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  which is new, is called Under Primacy, Weapons Sales Will Always Supercede Human Rights. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=15.84s)]
*  Anel, thanks so much for coming back on the show. Thank you for having me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=22.56s)]
*  So I just wanted to start here because as I just mentioned, obviously you resigned from [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=26.48s)]
*  the State Department under Biden. We've had you on to discuss your decision on that front, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=33.36s)]
*  but now we are in this Trump era and there are a variety of just mass human rights abuses that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=39.36s)]
*  the administration is engaging in. We just covered what's happening with the El Salvador gulags, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=47.28s)]
*  but also the disappearances of people speaking out against the genocide here in this country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=52.8s)]
*  As someone who felt compelled enough morally to resign from your job over this, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=60.4s)]
*  what's been your reaction to the Trump administration's escalation of these [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=66.08s)]
*  fascistic tactics? Yeah, it is really scary. In many ways, it's been certainly interesting to see [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=71.68s)]
*  the way that Democrats are finally speaking up about what's going on in contrast to under Biden, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  where we saw much less of that sort of convenient now to speak up now that they're no longer in [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=91.04s)]
*  power. And in many ways, while it is certainly abhorrent what Trump has been doing, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=96.08s)]
*  I do just want to emphasize that Biden initiated a lot of this, again, not to the level we're seeing, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=106.56s)]
*  but in particular things like characterizing the campus protesters as anti-Semitic, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=113.84s)]
*  instructing the federal government to use the IRA, the International Holocaust Remembrance [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=120.24s)]
*  Association's definition of anti-Semitism, which does include criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=125.92s)]
*  All of these ways that Trump is kind of building on the framework that Biden established, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=134.0s)]
*  and while certainly Trump has gone a lot further, I think the metaphor I've heard that I found [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=140.88s)]
*  useful was that Biden cleaned and loaded the gun, and now Trump is firing it. Obviously, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=147.2s)]
*  firing the gun is a lot more damaging than loading it, but still, Biden set up a lot of this. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=152.64s)]
*  And so while I welcome the fact that we are starting to see a few members of Congress [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=159.2s)]
*  calling this out, and I hope increasingly they will do so because it is becoming so apparent [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  that this is not just about the matter of Palestine, but it's about free speech, it's about [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=168.64s)]
*  the Constitution, it's about authoritarianism in this country. And I'm just a little worried that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=174.4s)]
*  people may sort of look back with rose-colored glasses at the Biden administration and say how [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=180.72s)]
*  much better things were then when they weren't. Well, they were not. And I mean, what may benefit [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=185.6s)]
*  us is that even Democrats are enraged by Biden and his holding on to power in the face of this [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=194.8s)]
*  fascistic administration. He doesn't have the Obama charisma that can paper over the way that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=202.08s)]
*  Obama made many mistakes and capitulated to the right. Biden is probably cooked and is likely [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=209.12s)]
*  going to be viewed as one of the worst presidents in the history of the country. I don't know. I [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=216.24s)]
*  mean, in history, but I also, who knows how history is going to respond to these things. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I'm reminded of, and I don't know if you've covered this on the show, the fact that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=225.68s)]
*  there was that YouGov slash IMU poll that found that 29% of voters who voted for Biden in 2020 [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=231.76s)]
*  didn't vote for Harris in 2024 listed Gaza as their main issue. And that was a higher percentage [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  than people who were concerned about immigration or inflation. So they lost the White House over [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=246.88s)]
*  this and maybe cost us American democracy. So I just hope that as Democrats are thinking about, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  if we're able to have functioning elections in the future, the fact that supporting genocide is not [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=260.24s)]
*  a winning political platform. I hope so too, but we interviewed a representative from Milla [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=266.56s)]
*  Jayapal maybe a month or two months ago. And I asked her this very question, have Democrats reckoned [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=275.44s)]
*  with how their support for genocide has particularly harmed their brand with young people? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=281.12s)]
*  I'm using my example as somebody who was inspired by Obama's anti-Iraq war stance. And that's how I [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=286.0s)]
*  first got interested in politics. And she said, honestly, no. And that's the thing where it really [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=291.36s)]
*  just strikes a chord with me. And now this kind of leads into what you wrote about, like, the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=298.24s)]
*  McCarthyite era also first was brought to the fore by Democrats who thought that they could do [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=306.96s)]
*  it in a more managed way. We can repress this kind of left-wing political speech, the commies. Now [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=316.96s)]
*  it's the anti-Semites on campus, meaning people outraged about genocide. We can do it in a more [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=323.44s)]
*  managed, targeted way. And then the right inevitably takes the mantle and it's authoritarian [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=329.84s)]
*  crackdown time. We execute the Rosenbergs. We blackball anybody with loose ties to communism. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=337.44s)]
*  That's a mirror of what we're seeing right now. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=346.55999999999995s)]
*  Exactly. And as you said in the report, a big part of the argument I make is looking into the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=350.08s)]
*  historical record of the fact that it's not just Trump or it's not just sort of US foreign policy [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=357.04s)]
*  since World War II has been driven by this imperative towards military primacy, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  one crucial aspect of which is weapon sales, and that under this overarching framework, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  the United States is never going to prioritize human rights. And in the report, I wasn't [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=377.04s)]
*  introducing a lot of information that was not previously public. I mean, I'm not allowed to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=385.36s)]
*  do that as a former government employee, but it's been interesting because I think people have, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=390.16s)]
*  I think it's tapping into something that people themselves are thinking and this awareness of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=397.2s)]
*  our image of ourselves as Americans and this idea of sort of American exceptionalism. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=404.0s)]
*  Certainly this is a very pervasive idea inside the State Department or inside US government that the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  US is a force for good in the world, that the US upholds human rights. As I say in the report, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=413.52s)]
*  I mean, that myth lies buried under the rubble of Gaza. And I think for many people around the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=420.4s)]
*  world, they no longer held that assumption. And I imagine many of your listeners also [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=427.76s)]
*  didn't hold that assumption, but so many Americans still sort of believe that. And I do think it is [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=434.0s)]
*  becoming increasingly difficult to maintain that fiction. Sorry, go ahead. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=440.4s)]
*  Yeah. No, that's, I think a good place for us to dive in now is we can, let's start as broadly [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=446.23999999999995s)]
*  as we can. When did the era of US primacy begin, as you understand it? And when did that get tied [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=453.35999999999996s)]
*  into the military industrial complex piece? Yeah. So I'm partly basing this on a former [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=464.48s)]
*  colleague here at Quincy who's now at Carnegie, Stephen Wertheim's excellent book called Tomorrow [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=474.0s)]
*  the World, where as a historian, he traces this and kind of the aftermath of World War II, this [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=478.16s)]
*  decision partly informed by the experience of the US economy going through sort of military [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=483.04s)]
*  industrialization to fight World War II and how that helped move the US economy out of the Great [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=492.16s)]
*  Depression. And then the choice to sort of perpetuate that. And at the time, this was motivated by [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=497.76000000000005s)]
*  Cold War logics, which as you mentioned, later morphed and was reflected in McCarthyism and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=504.32000000000005s)]
*  the sort of boogeyman of communism writ large. And as time went on, as the military industrial [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=513.44s)]
*  complex grew to such an extent that you had people like President Eisenhower himself, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=523.92s)]
*  a military, cautioning the American people about the influence of the defense industry, of kind of [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=528.88s)]
*  the ways in which this would help, this would drive our foreign policy. Then I go through the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=537.68s)]
*  fact that in the 1970s, there was a huge expansion in the weapons production and weapons sales around [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=543.28s)]
*  the world, which corresponded to the fact that this was the first time that Congress actually [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  said that, no, actually human rights should be part of our consideration when we are establishing [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=555.3599999999999s)]
*  our foreign policy and linking weapons sales to human rights in the law. Unfortunately, that law [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=560.64s)]
*  has never been applied because that would undermine such a core aspect of how we conduct [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=567.44s)]
*  our foreign policy, which is often driven by military sales, by security assistance writ large, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=573.36s)]
*  which includes weapon sales. So we have other law, I go through this in the report, the fact that [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=579.36s)]
*  there are other laws on the books, things like the Leahy laws, which would limit security assistance [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=586.08s)]
*  to a specific unit of a military that engages in gross human rights violations. You have 620i of [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=590.4000000000001s)]
*  the Foreign Assistance Act, which stipulates that if a country is blocking humanitarian aid, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=596.88s)]
*  they're no longer eligible for security assistance. But all of these are kind of piecemeal below the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=601.6s)]
*  broader law, which says if a government has engaged in gross violations of human rights, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=607.68s)]
*  they're no longer eligible for US security assistance. And yet that, again, that law has [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=613.04s)]
*  never been applied because that would undermine so much of how we conduct our foreign policy. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=619.28s)]
*  And I want to get to Israel specifically and the Middle East in just a second, but can you talk [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  about the origin of these efforts to say, okay, we'll sell a bunch of weapons, but this came about [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=631.28s)]
*  in the 70s, as you write, let's at least give consideration to human rights, or at least that [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=640.0s)]
*  was the stated purpose of the laws. Exactly. So yeah, the timing is interesting. It came about [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=645.52s)]
*  as the country was reacting to Nixon's imperial presidency and then Ford and the lack of [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=652.96s)]
*  accountability and the Vietnam War and grappling with what it was that the United States had [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=659.5200000000001s)]
*  enabled, had pursued in Vietnam. But in particular, it was actually the public recognition or [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=666.48s)]
*  realization of the fact that the US government had been involved in overthrowing Salvador Allende [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=673.76s)]
*  of Chile and installing Pinochet as a brutal dictator. That got a lot of attention. And this, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=679.28s)]
*  it was in that context that you had activists, various groups pushing for this idea that then [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=687.12s)]
*  Congress did legislate that the United States should not sell weapons to a country engaged in [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=694.3199999999999s)]
*  gross violations of human rights. And this is why the human rights reports exist. And one thing [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=699.76s)]
*  that was ironic is while I was at the State Department working in the human rights office, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=705.36s)]
*  a huge part of our time was putting together these human rights reports. There was never [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=711.28s)]
*  any acknowledgement of the idea that the reason Congress mandated these reports in the first place [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=716.48s)]
*  was to determine a country's eligibility for weapons sales. Instead, the reports were sort of [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=721.84s)]
*  seen as an end in and of themselves, that they're useful for NGOs, which is, you know, that may well [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=727.2s)]
*  be. But the original reason Congress required them had to do with weapons sales, and yet they've never [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=735.9200000000001s)]
*  been used for that purpose. So, you know, for me, as someone who had gone into state and was working [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=743.2800000000001s)]
*  on this to then come out and look more into the history of it and to just develop a better [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=751.92s)]
*  understanding of what the law actually says here, I mean, in many ways, it's not that surprising. And [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=757.28s)]
*  maybe, you know, shifting to Israel, because Israel is such a glaring example of where we have [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=763.52s)]
*  actually relatively clear laws on the books that we simply ignore. But that's also the case for so [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=769.8399999999999s)]
*  many other countries. You think of US support for Saudi Arabia or the UAE or Egypt, and I focus on [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=777.04s)]
*  the Middle East, but obviously it's not limited to the Middle East, where the US government is [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=782.56s)]
*  happy to call out the human rights abuses of adversaries like Iran or Syria, because we're [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=790.56s)]
*  not endangering weapons sales to those countries. But we are, the State Department or the US [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=795.28s)]
*  government is much less interested in publicly calling out human rights abuses by the Israelis, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=800.88s)]
*  by the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Egyptians, because A, you know, that might necessitate [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=809.12s)]
*  legal measures and a shift in policy. But it's just, it's seen as not actually conducive to US [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=816.32s)]
*  national security, because these partnerships are seen as more important, especially now [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=822.56s)]
*  in this context of great power competition, which was a leading motivator for the Biden [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=827.28s)]
*  administration, arguably still for Trump, although under Trump, because he's all over the place, it's [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=831.36s)]
*  less coherent. Sometimes hard to parse. But clearly, I mean, China is still a major concern [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=836.88s)]
*  for Trump as it was for Biden. Yeah, and we have never, never successfully in since the passing of [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=844.88s)]
*  these laws, as you write, successfully blocked weapon sales with these laws. So there's, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=852.0s)]
*  this is window dressing or treated as such by the Senate. And that has to do with that broad [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=856.8s)]
*  industry, the military industrial complex, how much it is a major part of our economy. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=864.64s)]
*  And Israel, let's pull up this, this second chart here that Anel has in her paper. This is [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=872.88s)]
*  figure two, looking at US military aid to Israel, starting in 1959 through 2024. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=882.4s)]
*  You'll be able to see how it jumps off the screen after the October 7 attacks to 17.9 billion, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=890.88s)]
*  but you can see how we really did maintain like just a baseline level of support for Israel [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=898.56s)]
*  from the 90s on. I mean, there's some short increases and you can see that in conjunction [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=905.04s)]
*  with the two wars that the United States started in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=911.2s)]
*  But that line goes way, way up. I mean, Israel support peaked at 14 billion. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=916.88s)]
*  And that was what, 1980. Now it's at nearly 18 billion in the wake of October 7 and to help [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=925.36s)]
*  support their genocide of Palestinians. Can you talk a little bit about Israel's role in maintaining [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=935.92s)]
*  a primacy for the United States? What do people view Israel as from a foreign policy strategic [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=943.68s)]
*  perspective? And like we've speculated on the show about its strategic placement in the Suez, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=955.52s)]
*  the fact that we need somebody in the Middle East who's directly aligned with us functioning [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=962.0s)]
*  as basically our colony in the Middle East because we don't want China to have influence [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=968.4s)]
*  in that area. And we use military force to beat them back basically. But what is your understanding [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=975.44s)]
*  of it? How do people in government view Israel's role in making sure that the United States is [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=982.8s)]
*  still the world superpower, which by the way, isn't happening anymore and is like 20 years out [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=988.48s)]
*  of date and is never returning? Well, I mean, when it does come to military spending and our military [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=993.04s)]
*  footprint, that is the one place where sort of the U.S. maintains this sort of superpower status. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1000.32s)]
*  And also in weapons sales, you know, the U.S. has been the leading arms dealer of the world [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1008.16s)]
*  since 1950, and that doesn't look like it's going to change anytime soon. I mean, as far [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1012.96s)]
*  as the perception of Israel, I think that this is so often used as a justification for U.S., [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1019.84s)]
*  the sort of unconditional and exorbitant levels of support the U.S. provides to Israel. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1026.08s)]
*  But the U.S. has a massive presence in the Middle East. We have bases all over. I mean, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1031.68s)]
*  you think also at the peak of the U.S. presence in the region during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1037.28s)]
*  the vast numbers. So whether or not Israel was part of that equation, it really didn't matter. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1043.68s)]
*  The U.S. mobilized to invade Iraq, mobilized to invade Afghanistan. In many ways, this notion that [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1052.8s)]
*  kind of Israel is the unthinkable aircraft carrier is what I've heard some people refer to it as. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1062.72s)]
*  But again, the U.S. has massive numbers of troops stationed around the region in countries that are [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1069.92s)]
*  very happy to host us, you know, whether it's Saudi Arabia or Qatar, the UAE, Bahrain. I mean, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1075.04s)]
*  you think about the massive military footprint in the Middle East. In contrast, Israel is an issue [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1081.92s)]
*  of domestic policy. You know, the power of the Israel lobby is informed by the American Jewish [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1091.2s)]
*  community, but much more by the American evangelical community who operate under the [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1097.76s)]
*  biblically informed belief that the Jews need to return, you know, need to be present in [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1106.56s)]
*  Israel for the Messiah to return. I mean, this is- [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1114.16s)]
*  And a majority of them die in that instance. I feel like I wish one reporter would ask, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1118.48s)]
*  one reporter. Like, I'm sorry to cut you off here, but like, I was watching CNN, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1125.52s)]
*  God help me last night, and Scott Jennings is debating this guy about anti-Semitism wearing [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1130.48s)]
*  the Israeli hostage pin. It's like, could someone have the balls to say, I don't know what his [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1137.1999999999998s)]
*  religion is, but what is your stake in it? Because if Republicans have to explain this, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  they're, if they have to actually get into the nitty gritty of it, you are calling for like [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1147.44s)]
*  mass extermination of Jews in your biblical end time prophecy. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1152.4s)]
*  Right. Right. And they're generally pretty open about, you know, this is what the Bible says. I [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1155.76s)]
*  mean, what's wild, and I may have brought this up before, because it's still just, I find it [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1160.88s)]
*  mind boggling, is that even people like Bill Clinton stating these kinds of talking points, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1166.48s)]
*  the idea that, well, God gave them this land. And it's like, are we basing our foreign policy on [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1171.44s)]
*  biblical, on like the Bible? Like, is that really what you want? Because if we're going back to that, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1179.92s)]
*  that is completely contradictory to our entire constitution, you know, like, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1186.56s)]
*  that is not what this country was set up to be. And so just [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  the ways in which Israel is sort of this unconditional support, you know, that insane [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1197.44s)]
*  level of support that that graph shows, which again only goes up to October of last year and [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1204.24s)]
*  doesn't account for money sent since then, including under the Biden administration and credit to [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1209.68s)]
*  Stephen Semmler for that excellent graph that we used. That it is, it's sort of justified by like, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1214.0800000000002s)]
*  it is, it's sort of justified by like, well, this is necessary to our foreign policy when really [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1223.04s)]
*  it's just a matter of domestic policy, which is somewhat similar to understanding the power of [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1227.76s)]
*  the military industrial complex, or even as you said, you know, weapons production or military [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1234.24s)]
*  defense production is such an important part of our economy. But in fact, it's not actually that [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1239.2s)]
*  big. It's just that they have a very powerful lobby. And so when you have these massive wars, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1244.8799999999999s)]
*  the CEOs of these companies, the shareholders of these companies, make so much money, but they [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1252.72s)]
*  maintain this myth that this is a core, you know, this is core to America's, you know, labor, you [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1261.52s)]
*  know, if you support labor, you support American labor, you have to support weapons production, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1267.76s)]
*  which is really not true. And in part, just because when you actually break it down and look [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1272.24s)]
*  at things like where is weapons production happening, these districts are more likely to [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1276.64s)]
*  deal with higher levels of poverty. Like these are not jobs that are that are kind of bringing [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1282.8000000000002s)]
*  people up by their bootstraps. And if you look dollar for dollar at something like if the US [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1288.3200000000002s)]
*  government invested in something like education or green energy or healthcare, dollar for dollar, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1292.96s)]
*  as much as they sort of our industrial policy invests in the military industrial complex and [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1302.64s)]
*  support subsidizing weapons production, the outcome like the return on investment would be [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1307.68s)]
*  so much higher for our economy as well as for these workers themselves. So again, it's this sort of [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1314.5600000000002s)]
*  myth that the US has to continue to support Israel because it's necessary for our approach [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1322.16s)]
*  to the Middle East and our ability to sort of maintain our military footprint in the Middle [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1328.48s)]
*  East, which is nonsense. And this idea that the US, you know, that it's in our US national interest [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1333.84s)]
*  to continue to provide, you know, now a trillion dollars a year to the DOD and defense contractors [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1340.88s)]
*  to manufacture these weapons because that's good for the American worker. Like both of those are [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1347.1200000000001s)]
*  just are false. And so and that kind of both of them are also still justified under this notion [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1354.56s)]
*  that that without the United States, human rights would fall by the wayside. You know, it is the [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1364.32s)]
*  United States to, you know, hold other countries accountable for human rights or that it is up to [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1371.12s)]
*  US military power, you know, without US military primacy, you know, China and Russia would be in [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1377.36s)]
*  charge and, you know, clearly they don't care about human rights. And she's like, well, clearly [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1383.44s)]
*  our country doesn't care about human rights. So who believes that anymore? Besides, I don't know, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1387.6000000000001s)]
*  like like people's parents, people's parents, so many people at the State Department. And, you know, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1391.8400000000001s)]
*  maybe this report was really just intended for my former colleagues. But but this notion of American [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1399.6000000000001s)]
*  exceptionalism, I do think motivates people, you know, to continue to do this work. And, you know, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1407.12s)]
*  for all that I'm shocked and horrified by everything the Trump administration is doing, I do think it [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  may be useful for stripping away some of these illusions and making it harder for people to [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1419.12s)]
*  continue to lie to themselves about the role the US plays in the world. Which underwritens so many [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1424.32s)]
*  people still kind of did and and I think would have continued to do if we'd had President Harris. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1431.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and that is, I guess, the the cost of enlightening people is not worth the bodies. I [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1438.9599999999998s)]
*  mean, I don't I can't make that calculation. But if we're looking for ways to move forward, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgYimy28kU&t=1446.7199999999998s)]
