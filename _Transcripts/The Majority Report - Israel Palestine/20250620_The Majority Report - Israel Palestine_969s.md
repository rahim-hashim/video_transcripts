# One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE)
*  We are back and we are joined now by Omar Al-Aqad, award-winning journalist and novelist, author of his latest, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=0.0s)]
*  One Day Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This. The title is pretty self-explanatory, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=7.2s)]
*  but Omar, thanks so much for coming on the show. It's my pleasure. Thanks for having me. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=18.32s)]
*  First of all, I can promise you that this would be the first, maybe the first, one of your only media [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=19.92s)]
*  interviews on this book that you won't be asked to condemn Hamas. So I think, you know, you're in good hands here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=26.16s)]
*  I had the statement ready. All right, fine. I guess we'll make do. We'll make do. So you were born in Cairo. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=35.2s)]
*  Your book kind of interweaves your personal story, coming to the West as a teenager, coming to Canada, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=44.0s)]
*  where you've been in both worlds, right? And you had this [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=51.199999999999996s)]
*  shift in your world, but you had the mental clarity being an older kid at that point to kind of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=57.12s)]
*  see some of those differences in coming to the United States, sorry, to Canada. Just tell us a little bit about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=64.24s)]
*  that transition, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=72.0s)]
*  what your conception of Western values were versus how you experienced them when coming to the United States. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=74.88s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's... I mean, Canada. I keep saying United States. I mean, I ended up in the U.S. eventually, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=82.08s)]
*  about 11, 12 years ago. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=89.28s)]
*  So it's a bit of a circuitous route, right? Because I'm born in Egypt. My dad has to get the hell out of Egypt when I'm five years old. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=91.76s)]
*  And so we moved to Qatar, which, you know, pound for pound is the richest place on Earth. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=99.44s)]
*  And if you've never been, it's a very [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  relatively surreal lifestyle. You know, if you're not among the migrant laborer class who are treated like absolute dirt, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  if you're sort of middle class and up, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=115.44s)]
*  it's the easiest life in the world, in large part because you're stepping on the necks of the folks who actually sort of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=117.44s)]
*  built the place. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  But if you're not sort of born into a Qatari family, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=126.24s)]
*  you can't stay in Qatar permanently. You're always in a kind of precarious situation where your visa could be revoked or, you know, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  so on and so forth. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=135.60000000000002s)]
*  And so we had [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=137.28s)]
*  planned on that happening and my dad had decided to start the immigration process to Canada. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=139.36s)]
*  At the time, he couldn't point out Canada on the map. It was just sort of the next destination because once you leave your home, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=144.88s)]
*  that's kind of the life you live. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=152.8s)]
*  You're looking for the next harbor. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=155.84s)]
*  And the way I thought of Canada, specifically the U.S., the West generally, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  was as a kind of harbor. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  To me, it wasn't so much [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=166.56s)]
*  a place as a kind of negation. When you grow up in a place like Qatar, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  everything is censored, for example. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=173.68s)]
*  You know, I have these formative memories of holding up copies of Newsweek to the light [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=176.72s)]
*  to try and see past the black ink that the censor had used [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=180.72000000000003s)]
*  to block off whatever was, you know, deemed too dangerous for me to read. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  And so my first impression of the West [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=189.28s)]
*  was essentially just a negation of that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=192.32s)]
*  I don't care what this place is, but at least I can go there and I don't have to deal with this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=194.8s)]
*  And for the most part, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=201.12s)]
*  that is what it was for me when I first showed up to Canada. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, I go to the library and I can ask for any book I want and I don't have to worry about [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=206.08s)]
*  the possibility of getting deported if it's the wrong thing or, you know, that sort of thing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=210.96s)]
*  And for the majority of my life in this part of the world, that was enough. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=216.4s)]
*  I could deal with everything else. I could deal with the racism. I could deal with the sort of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=220.56s)]
*  petty indignities because I had that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=224.72s)]
*  And I think the book, in large part, is about the moment where [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=228.56s)]
*  that trade-off wasn't something I could do anymore, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=233.28s)]
*  where the price I was paying for that became too high for me to bear. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=236.24s)]
*  And that threshold, was that crossed in the environment after October 7th? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, what was that feeling like for you to kind of see? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=248.96s)]
*  We experienced it covering it on the show. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=256.8s)]
*  The immediate aftermath of the Hamas attack was [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=260.0s)]
*  this whole display of this ramp up of what the genocide was going to look like. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=266.16s)]
*  And I think we all foresaw that it was going to be a genocidal slaughter. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=271.12s)]
*  I don't know if we could have foreseen it being a year and eight months long, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  and us having basically no idea being completely in the dark at this point, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  about how many are dead. I mean, it's in the hundreds of thousands. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=290.08s)]
*  And yet there's still this Western narrative that it's, oh, it's 58 or it's 60,000 people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=293.76s)]
*  The slaughter that we've seen, it was quite obvious. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=301.52s)]
*  The title of your book is a version of a tweet that you put out that went viral. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=307.44s)]
*  It was quite obvious in the weeks following. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=311.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think for me, the way I've been describing it is, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  in terms of this break, at least personally for me, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=320.24s)]
*  I've been describing it the same way that sort of Hemingway's characters went bankrupt, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=325.84s)]
*  little by little and then all at once. I was a journalist for 10 years. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=329.52s)]
*  And there were things that I saw that, if I was a less cowardly person, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=334.88000000000005s)]
*  would have probably brought me to this break much sooner. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=340.56s)]
*  You know, you go to Afghanistan and you see the local soldiers being put on the front lines of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=343.76000000000005s)]
*  every forward operating base such that if the attack comes, they're the ones who die, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  not the NATO soldiers. You see the hierarchy of human life. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=353.68s)]
*  You go to Guantanamo, you see this ad hoc legal system in violation of all normal [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=357.12s)]
*  legal modes designed purely to get these convictions. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=364.48s)]
*  And in every case, I was able to compartmentalize and to say, yes, there's something kind of rotten [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=369.44s)]
*  here, but it's just this moment and it's just this situation. It's unique to this. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=375.04s)]
*  And I think what has happened over the last 20 months is that my ability to compartmentalize [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=380.48s)]
*  has imploded. You know, I keep coming back to the same three factors [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=384.8s)]
*  that make this different for me. And those are sort of intimacy, immediacy, and complicity. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=392.56s)]
*  I wake up every morning and within moments of the horrible thing happening, I see it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=403.84s)]
*  Little kids starving to death, toddlers torn apart by the force of these bombs. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=411.76s)]
*  There's an intimacy and there's an immediacy to it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=418.23999999999995s)]
*  That if I was a perfect human being, probably shouldn't matter, right? What's wrong is wrong, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=421.91999999999996s)]
*  regardless of how immediate or intimate it might be. But it does matter that I see it so closely. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  And then thirdly, there's the complicity, right? My tax dollars are doing this, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  right? I'm killing those kids. That's me. And so it becomes impossible to ignore in the way that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=439.84s)]
*  I so successfully ignored these things previously. That's what's changed for me. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=445.84s)]
*  And it's not like these currents weren't present before. You don't even have to look to Afghanistan [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=451.28s)]
*  or to Guantanamo Bay. You can look to Gaza itself. This place has been an open-air prison [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=457.84s)]
*  for years and years and years, and nobody cared. On October 6th of 2023, a report came out [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=463.44s)]
*  detailing how deadly a year it was for Palestinian children. That's never the starting point of any [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=470.32s)]
*  narrative around this, but it existed. And I was able to ignore it. And that's a function of the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=476.88s)]
*  kind of human being I am. That's a function of the obliviousness that largely carried me through my [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=483.44s)]
*  existence in the West and has largely fallen apart now. Well, I think, you know, it's not [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=489.12s)]
*  moral failing. It's more just what's engendered in us as a part of being in the West. We have an [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=499.84s)]
*  ivory tower kind of view of the other parts of the global South and the Middle East that we exploit. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  But the other part that's so striking in your book is like, it's even in the title, when we're [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=516.24s)]
*  talking about this moral rot of Western liberalism, which I want to get into even more [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=522.4s)]
*  specifically, but just the idea that people can't see historical parallels or feel this immense [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=529.52s)]
*  guilt about being on the wrong side of history. Your analysis of this moment, can you speak a [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=535.92s)]
*  little bit more about the inconsistency of things like, you know, how we speak about the Holocaust [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=543.6s)]
*  and never again. And then the silence of some of those same people as this genocide is not being [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=549.68s)]
*  done. We don't read about it the next day in the newspaper. We see it every day on our phone. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  I think for me, the best I've been able to answer that kind of question [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=566.0s)]
*  has to do with the sort of reward and punishment equilibrium. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=572.2399999999999s)]
*  With respect to something like the suffering of the Palestinian people, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=576.0s)]
*  certainly where I live, I live out on the West Coast. I think this is true of [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  most of the United States, if not the Western world at large. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=586.72s)]
*  There is essentially no consequence to pretending none of this is happening. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=590.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, I wake up every day and I open my computer and I see evidence of the worst things [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=595.68s)]
*  human beings can do to one another. And then I go about my day and it's as though none of this is [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=603.76s)]
*  happening. You know, and there's emails that need to be replied to and there's bills that need to be [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=609.6s)]
*  paid and there's Zoom meetings that need to drag on endlessly and you need to do the stuff. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=614.4s)]
*  And in fact, not only is there no consequence for the vast majority of the people that I'm around [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=621.04s)]
*  at any given moment to thinking about any of this, there's an immense punishment waiting if you do [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=625.68s)]
*  think about this too much and if you do talk about this too much. I mean, I was on tour for [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=631.28s)]
*  this book for two and a half months and at virtually every event, somebody would come up [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=636.4s)]
*  to me afterwards and say, this is the first space where I've been able to sit with this, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=642.16s)]
*  where I've been able to think about this. Because if I talk about this at work, I might get fired. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=648.0s)]
*  If I talk about this with my friends, they might stop being my friends. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=653.52s)]
*  And it's not, you know, they're not there at this event because they love me or they love the book. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=657.3599999999999s)]
*  They don't care about any of that. It's just a place where you can feel like you're not losing [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=661.28s)]
*  your mind. And so I think a lot of this makes perfect sense if you have conditioned yourself [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  to believe that Palestinians are not sufficiently human. And you're good. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=673.28s)]
*  How has that conditioning made itself manifest in the West? I mean, there's a lot of discussion [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=680.0s)]
*  about anti-Semitism in this country. Anti-Jewish hate is a real thing, but a great majority of [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=687.92s)]
*  the instances that are cited are protests against Zionism and the genocide. And I can name dozens of [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=695.8399999999999s)]
*  think pieces that I've seen just in the last month on that very topic. And yet Islamophobia, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=705.04s)]
*  which, you know, even in the word, right, it sounds like you're afraid of spiders. But Islamophobia [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=712.8s)]
*  is the most pernicious and widespread bigotry in our country right now. And it crosses traditional [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=720.56s)]
*  political lines where when we're talking about Western liberalism, there's this kind of hollowness [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=730.0s)]
*  of performing virtue and doing so in basically an explicitly domestic context about groups that have [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=737.52s)]
*  been marginalized historically in this country. But when that looks outward and expands to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=746.56s)]
*  the consequences of capitalism and imperialism, of which the Gaza genocide is both, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=753.1199999999999s)]
*  why is that analysis failing? And why is it in the end so racist in outcome with so many of these [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=761.1999999999999s)]
*  people who would balk at that idea if it was applied to black people, here domestically, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=768.7199999999999s)]
*  Latino people, etc.? I mean, there's a couple of things that come to mind. First and foremost, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=774.0s)]
*  we live in an incredibly anti-Semitic part of the world. The current administration is rife with [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=782.0799999999999s)]
*  raging anti-Semites. I mean, I know that it's sort of been buried under god knows how many scandals [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=787.92s)]
*  and outrages now, but it wasn't that long ago that we were sitting around trying to discern [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=795.04s)]
*  whether one of the central figures in this administration was actually making a Nazi salute [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=799.84s)]
*  or not. I mean, this isn't subtle stuff. I think that is separate from a patently disingenuous [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=804.72s)]
*  effort to conflate criticism of a state that is currently engaged in an act of genocide [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=812.72s)]
*  with anti-Jewish hatred. I think that is a patently bad faith effort, but it doesn't [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=818.32s)]
*  change the fact that we do live in an incredibly anti-Semitic part of the world. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=825.6800000000001s)]
*  I think with respect to Islamophobia, one of the reasons that it has essentially no effect is [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=830.1600000000001s)]
*  because it can have no effect. The consequences of this country or this part of the world [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=837.2800000000001s)]
*  genuinely caring about anti-Muslim or anti-Arab hatred are too immense to ponder, because the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=844.8000000000001s)]
*  second we decide that these human beings, of which I am one, are sufficiently human, such as to warrant [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=852.0s)]
*  actual response to this hatred. We're not just contending with the random stuff that's yelled [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=858.88s)]
*  at me every now and then on the street. We're not just contending with angry comments on Twitter from [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=865.36s)]
*  Freedom Eagle 1776 at Hotmail or whatever, right? We are contending with wholesale slaughter, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=873.1999999999999s)]
*  which is happening right now. How do you go about sort of admitting to yourself [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=880.64s)]
*  that this is the consequence of the thing you've allowed to fester? I think just at a societal [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=888.4s)]
*  level, at a governmental level, once you start thinking of these human beings as being sufficiently [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=894.16s)]
*  human to warrant condemnation, the thing you have to condemn is so overwhelming and so all-encompassing [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=899.36s)]
*  and so all-indicating as to essentially require something much, much bigger than a statement of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=906.0s)]
*  apology or some declaration of regret or something. I think that's part of it. Honestly, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=914.32s)]
*  part of it is proximity to whiteness. I know full well that I get very different reactions depending [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=920.96s)]
*  on whether the first thing someone hears about me is this accent or whether they read my name first. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=929.36s)]
*  Those are two entirely different human beings, primarily because this accent has a proximity [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=934.88s)]
*  to whiteness and this name doesn't. I know I have to live with that. That's the calculus of my [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=940.08s)]
*  existence in this part of the world and that's not going to change overnight. Hey folks, don't [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-pBbdN6XE&t=944.72s)]
