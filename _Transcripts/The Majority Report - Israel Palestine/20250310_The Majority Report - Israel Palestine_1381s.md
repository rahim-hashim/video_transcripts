*  Activity here is protest free speech and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=80.04s)]
*  The Trump administration will not tolerate it many are not students except for this student [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=84.16s)]
*  They are paid agitators [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=92.32s)]
*  Who also happen to be students? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=95.28s)]

*  parenthetically [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=126.28s)]
*  Did you care where I expanded the rules of engagement that allow us to kill more innocent men women and children? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=127.12s)]
*  Around the globe. Yeah, don't okay close parentheses [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=134.56s)]
*  Your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests and you're not welcome here [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=138.32000000000002s)]

*  It's like he's signing off like an email asking to set up a meeting [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  Mamoud Khalil, his wife is eight months pregnant. He's here legally with a green card. It's a Columbia grad student until this past December [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=155.56s)]
*  He's been helping organize the anti-genocide demonstrations and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  He was just taken and disappeared by ice where he was picked up from his apartment [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  there [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=176.56s)]
*  According to Prem talker who's been doing great reporting on this [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=178.08s)]
*  his lawyer [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  tried to contact officials about to find out his whereabouts and was hung up on and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  Now reportedly he is at a facility in Louisiana [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  As of this morning, that's what has been reported that an ice facility that that in August 2024 the ACLU [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=193.4s)]
*  did a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=201.88000000000002s)]
*  analysis of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  specifically this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=204.72000000000003s)]
*  Louisiana facility called inside the black hole systemic human rights abuses against immigrants detained and disappeared in Louisiana [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=206.4s)]
*  And this is the party that says that they're about free speech [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=215.36s)]
*  I mean even if this guy is being held in a four-star [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=218.67999999999998s)]
*  Hotel [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  The idea [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  That this permanent resident [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=229.44s)]
*  Or really anybody I mean you realize if they can do it to a permanent resident [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=233.44s)]
*  They can do it to a citizen and they want you to know even if you don't have a pregnant wife [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=237.44s)]
*  like this is un-american garbage, but [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=240.72s)]
*  Sunday evening DHS DHS spokesperson Trisha McLaughlin [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=243.28s)]
*  Sent a follow-up statement confirming that ice arrested. That's in quotes Khalil [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=248.32s)]
*  Are you ready for the charge for activities aligned? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=254.08s)]
*  to Hamas [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=258.56s)]
*  Not [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=261.36s)]
*  Supporting Hamas not providing material support to Hamas just activities aligned to Hamas [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=262.56s)]
*  That's how vague this is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=269.68s)]
*  And [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  In other words, he's arrested for no reason [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  Emma was on [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=280.52s)]
*  Amon mulled ines show last night on MSNBC. Let's play that clip [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=282.52s)]
*  And I'll start with you and and what you make of this crackdown on free speech with with this very alarming and dangerous [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=289.04s)]
*  arrest of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil a person who has a permanent residency here, but also a [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=297.84s)]
*  Student well, it's deeply disturbing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=302.28s)]
*  I mean, I'll start by saying that Donald Trump and his administration when it comes to their immigration crackdown [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=304.28s)]
*  They're reclassifying just people who may not have full documentation when they came over the border as criminals [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=310.56s)]
*  So it justifies deporting them in mass or detaining them in mass [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=317.12s)]
*  Which is what we are seeing as they call them criminals and they're applying that same place [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=320.96s)]
*  They call them criminals and they're applying that same playbook here to crack down on dissent on Palestine and frankly [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=325.28s)]
*  the Democrats need to show some metal and draw a contrast with Donald Trump here because [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=332.23999999999995s)]
*  You know people say sometimes fascism is colonialism turned inward where? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  The chickens come home to roost at the end of the day if the Democrats don't stand with [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=342.88s)]
*  Is the part dropside uploaded you can just go to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  there [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=354.68s)]
*  This wasn't necessarily the exact part, but yeah, I mean it's [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=357.24s)]
*  The point remains remains. Yeah that this dynamic that they're applying here. They're going abroad [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=361.68s)]
*  And this is the way it works, right you start with the most marginalized people who are in the country [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=367.44s)]
*  You create a [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=375.28s)]
*  Justification you keep that justification [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=378.68s)]
*  Justification [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=381.2s)]
*  Broad enough so that it can be again to be applied to greater numbers of people right I mean if you can [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=382.56s)]
*  If you can deport an [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=392.2s)]
*  Undocumented immigrant [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=396.28s)]
*  Based upon a crime in criminalize as opposed to a civil punishment for crossing the border [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=398.32s)]
*  Then you can deport someone who is a legal immigrant [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=405.08s)]
*  And if you can deport someone who's a legal immigrant [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=411.56s)]
*  You can deport person who is a permanent resident, and if you can do deport a permanent resident who is [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=415.24s)]
*  Theoretically has all the same [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=423.68s)]
*  protections under the Constitution and not just deport but [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=426.56s)]
*  Disappear right like literally for 24 hours. No idea where this guy was [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=431.24s)]
*  You can do this with citizens. It's just [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=438.4s)]
*  This is the way they do it. Here's that clip [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=441.2s)]
*  Up as like you know defenders of free speech Kathy Hokel here recently [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=444.52s)]
*  Hunter College removed a job posting for a Palestinian studies teaching position saying she wanted to be sure anti-semitic theories [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=450.0s)]
*  Would not be taught [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=457.8s)]
*  It's not like they have a very good track record on this either [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=460.24s)]
*  No, but they should and I point to what I said earlier about the Democratic voters are not aligned with how the leadership is [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=462.96s)]
*  Responding here and I think we can demand more of Democrats right now [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  There was a poll in CNN in February that said that over 70% of Democratic voters are unhappy with congressional Democrats right now [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=473.96s)]
*  And how they haven't stood up to Trump more and I think that goes hand-in-hand with the Israel debate here [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  How can we draw a contrast with Donald Trump and his authoritarianism? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=487.0s)]
*  When the Republicans talk about free speech what they mean is can we say slurs on the internet again? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=490.72s)]
*  Can we feel okay saying [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=495.92s)]
*  I mean really that's what it is and then but for the Democrats and for the left [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=498.32s)]
*  The anti-war movement has always been an integral part of social progress particularly on college campuses as well [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=503.64s)]
*  So when we're trying to combat Trump drawing a contrast is as important as anything and I think to bring young people back on [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=510.08s)]
*  Board who have been galvanized by this seeing images of slaughtered children over and over on their phone [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=517.8s)]
*  I mean there was a letter written by [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=523.7199999999999s)]
*  99 physicians nurses back in October to Vice President Harris and Biden [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=526.28s)]
*  At the time and they said that at minimum [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=532.28s)]
*  118,000 Palestinians have been killed [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  That is a lowball estimate and much higher than the what? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=538.5999999999999s)]
*  47,000 that people are still using at this point [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=542.76s)]
*  This is an untold slaughter and amnesty international calls it a genocide as is human rights watch [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=544.76s)]
*  The Democrats have to reckon with how young people have seen the leadership of the party accept this [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=550.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and then move forward in a more positive direction because they can because the voters want them to join there is any [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=556.56s)]
*  And we should say [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=562.52s)]
*  This is [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=565.16s)]
*  There's a lot of polling now that show yeah that Democrats have [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=567.7199999999999s)]
*  become [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=573.0799999999999s)]
*  More sympathetic with the Palestinian cause than the Israeli cause here [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=574.56s)]
*  I cited it on the show that it came out maybe three or four days ago [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=580.16s)]
*  Gallup poll Democrats on this 59% is the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=584.12s)]
*  Majority opinion in terms of who you're more sympathetic with the Palestinians or the Israelis now [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  It's 21% down for the Israelis when you look at the general public that gap is narrowing [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=594.04s)]
*  But it's more aligned with where independents are shocker Republicans sympathize with the Israelis much more [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=599.36s)]
*  So my point there and I was just trying to be a bit strategic because I know I'm speaking to an audience where they're more [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  Democrats that are paying attention, but good on amen by the way who opened that segment with this story [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=612.2s)]
*  I mean, it's a shame that his show is getting sidelined because he really has been a phenomenal voice for the Palestinian people [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=617.7600000000001s)]
*  But [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=625.1600000000001s)]
*  The fact that Kathy Hokel is removing that job posting and that you have Democrats engaging in this suppression of speech [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=626.1600000000001s)]
*  Opposing the slaughter in Gaza. It's it's not it's not in their self-interest [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=633.76s)]
*  Even if you don't care about Palestinian children, it is not in the self-interest of Democrats to continue to go down this road [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=639.44s)]
*  And I wanted the audience to know that if you are feeling a little bit queasy about entering into this debate [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=645.64s)]
*  And it's not something you fully understand but you see how Palestinian kids are being slaughtered right now [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=652.26s)]
*  Know that you're not alone that Democratic voters are changing with you [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=658.58s)]
*  Even if the Democratic leadership isn't representing your interest on this for on this issue, right? I [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=662.1s)]
*  Mean, I mean it's crazy. I mean has Chuck Schumer said anything. He was talking about Edmund Pettus bridge yesterday. No tweets [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=668.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they're gonna say anything at all. No, they're not because their silence is paid for already [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=675.66s)]
*  well the Bailey's live in Long Island and they don't pay attention to what goes on in the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=681.32s)]
*  crazy hippie universities [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=687.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I guess they don't have phones or tik-tok or the internet or anything. Oh, no [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=691.44s)]
*  No, they just got cable [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=697.4000000000001s)]
*  They they I mean I think that's a big part of it too that Democrats don't know how to respond in the internet [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=701.0400000000001s)]
*  Age like we're not cutting cable [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=706.9200000000001s)]
*  They actually just brought it into their home like like that knew something that happened where they basically were Charlie Kirk and they had that that [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=709.78s)]
*  Conversation where he threw trans kids under the bus that was brought up on that show last night, too [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=718.4s)]
*  That's traveling and like does did they really think that politics? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=722.48s)]
*  it's like the 90s where they can just do some sort of popularist pivot and people don't associate them with [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=726.5400000000001s)]
*  Like the weakness that it displays and the flip-flopping is way more salient [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=732.54s)]
*  That is the whole point is yeah, that is [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=738.54s)]
*  That is a perfect sign that that guy doesn't know how to do politics. Yeah [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=741.62s)]
*  You can do very well [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=747.4599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I remember when Rudy Giuliani was America's mayor and as soon as he went up to New Hampshire, it was like [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=748.7399999999999s)]
*  Just a crap show for him when he started to run for president right Gavin Newsom is running into the same problem [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=756.0999999999999s)]
*  Because he's like well, I've been able to sort of like ride this and Cuomo has the same delusions [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=762.54s)]
*  Quite, you know [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=769.14s)]
*  Gavin Newsom like I've been able to sort of like create this image that I'm this you know [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=770.5s)]
*  blazing liberal and I've got a temper this right and [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=776.8199999999999s)]
*  The opportunity to do that type of thing is [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=783.9399999999999s)]
*  Is [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=787.0600000000001s)]
*  Much less than it used to be in fact, that's what got Kamala Harris in trouble, too [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=789.3000000000001s)]
*  Exactly had Kamala Harris just simply stuck is stuck by her guns and said you can disagree with me on this [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=795.3000000000001s)]
*  You can disagree with me that in prisons in [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=801.7800000000001s)]
*  California we give health care because we don't want people to die. Yep in prisons [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=806.3000000000001s)]
*  And so we give health care and health care under Medicaid is defined includes [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=812.54s)]
*  Transcare and you could argue with me that you're wrong that those two people who have ever gotten that care [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=819.06s)]
*  The tiny amount of tax dollars there you can say that's wrong, but I'm sorry [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=826.42s)]
*  This is what the law is. This is what I believe in you have a problem with that. Okay, that's your right [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=830.38s)]
*  showing that kind of strength [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=836.9s)]
*  Democrats don't understand [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=839.38s)]
*  The funny thing is is like the greatest triangulator in the world Bill Clinton was going around saying strong and wrong [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=841.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's the way to do it be [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=847.38s)]
*  And that's the one lesson they didn't seem to even [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=849.9399999999999s)]
*  Get from that era everything else is triangulating the backing off the stuff the trying to change people's perspective on like, you know [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=853.3s)]
*  Why he's being impeached? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=861.26s)]
*  They all have that even though they don't have the underlying [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=863.98s)]
*  Opportunity but the idea that Gavin Newsom goes out and thinks that's the way to do this. He's moron [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=867.26s)]
*  Yeah, he's more on it [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=872.82s)]
*  It just tells me the guy does not have the political chops not to go outside of his tiny sort of like a bubble now [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=874.34s)]
*  California huge state [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=880.7800000000001s)]
*  Big fifth biggest economy in the country [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=882.94s)]
*  He does not know what it's gonna take to win as president against Republicans [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=888.5400000000001s)]
*  He's won many times in a state where there is no real Republican [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=894.6999999999999s)]
*  Challenge yeah also you mean fifth biggest [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=900.02s)]
*  economy in the world economy in the world right say in the state but but Newsom is yeah you said in the country but [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=903.8199999999999s)]
*  Newsom is [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=909.26s)]
*  Doing the popularism thing right? It's like the Maddie Glacier is like we just look at the polls [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=910.9799999999999s)]
*  Everything's based we we we worship the polls and we can't change them as politicians apparently [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=916.3399999999999s)]
*  But if the polls say this is the issue we should go after we should support then we should do that [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=921.86s)]
*  I mean and sometimes that's the case like universal health care polls very well [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=926.86s)]
*  But they don't use that as their ballast to move forward [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=930.5s)]
*  It's not just use it about to marginalize trans people and throw them under the bus because it doesn't have caused them to change their class [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=934.46s)]
*  Interest but it's not the polling is not even clear on this issue [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=940.1800000000001s)]
*  First of all people say as an issue they rank it as low as possible given as a 21 out of like, you know [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=942.82s)]
*  Whatever 25 and and then if you again you can ask poll questions a lot of different ways [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=949.02s)]
*  But if you ask there are one I think in a relevant way [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=954.5s)]
*  Which is like which party you trust on LGBT issues Democrats walk away with it [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=956.9399999999999s)]
*  But it's then you just get into the Matt Walsh style polling things that [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=961.34s)]
*  Democrats like this like to react to because I think Gavin Newsom when he takes this issue on trans people [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=965.98s)]
*  He's not talking caring about voters. He's caring about rich people who are like Democrats are a little bit too social justice [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=971.38s)]
*  Can you be my person who's gonna walk away from that and Gavin Newsom's like, yeah, of course [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=977.5400000000001s)]
*  This is a disease that that exists throughout like corporate culture [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=982.02s)]
*  Like I mean, I just remember even in TV like the idea is like we want to attract a younger [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=986.74s)]
*  We want to get 18 to 25 year olds. So we're going to put on [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=992.1800000000001s)]
*  exclusively 18 to 25 year olds and I'm like when I was a kid I watched people who were [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=997.7s)]
*  Older than it was about the yeah this stuff that they were doing that I was interested in and [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1003.6999999999999s)]
*  It's just that you can sell idiots [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1010.42s)]
*  And a lot of these donors. I mean we can see that the wealthiest man in the world is a effing idiot [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1013.3s)]
*  driven literally by [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1020.6999999999999s)]
*  narcotics and [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1022.8599999999999s)]
*  Therapeutic drugs and maybe some neuro [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1025.54s)]
*  Post-apartheid trauma yes and daddy issues and [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1030.16s)]
*  But you're rather than argue with their billionaire funders [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1035.4s)]
*  They bring something up you go out like a trained monkey to show that you can do it and you and your [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1040.04s)]
*  consultant class [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1045.92s)]
*  Advisors they look at these polls and rather than thinking wait a second [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1048.96s)]
*  What's more important than something that was the 21st reason why Democratic voters may have voted in an election [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1053.9599999999998s)]
*  Maybe it's more important to show leadership [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1061.52s)]
*  And maybe the way that you show leadership is to take an issue like that and show why? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1065.08s)]
*  People should change their minds. It is a [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1071.84s)]
*  cynical view of the American public that [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1075.28s)]
*  basically treats them as cattle that can be herded around based on polling numbers as opposed to [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1077.9199999999998s)]
*  leading from [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1083.92s)]
*  What you believe in and seeing how that follows in such a stark contrast to Bernie Sanders asking people in the audience about what they're [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1086.3600000000001s)]
*  Going through economically that is taking the voter seriously and part of the biggest problem that the Democrats have is that? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1093.68s)]
*  Folks feel rightly that they're talked down to by a guy like Gavin Newsom who looks at the spreadsheet and says okay [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1100.28s)]
*  Transport's not popular. I don't really care about trans people [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1107.2s)]
*  I'll throw them under the bus with Charlie Kirk who you know helped bus people on January 6th to [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1110.02s)]
*  Let's play a clip of Charlie Kirk [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1116.3s)]
*  That's it. Do we have do we have Gavin Newsom on Charlie Kirk saying this stuff? We played it already on [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1118.94s)]
*  Oh, we did. Yeah, let's play that other clip. I just pulled him Charlie Kirk. I wonder if Gavin Newsom is okay with this [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1123.74s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder if the other Gavin Newsom is okay with [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1129.3s)]
*  going on [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1133.42s)]
*  Charlie Kirk for this [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1134.62s)]
*  This is Charlie Kirk now to be fair this was [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1137.1799999999998s)]
*  Almost a year and a half ago, so this is almost 18 months ago. That's a change [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1142.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm sure it's very different. Was this it was Gavin Sun will listen to this [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1147.58s)]
*  Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1153.3s)]
*  Hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them now. I don't like generalizations [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1157.8999999999999s)]
*  Not every Jewish person believes that but [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1162.94s)]
*  Jewish person believes that but it is true. The Anti-Defamation League was part and parcel with Black Lives Matter [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1175.3000000000002s)]
*  It is true that some of the largest financiers of left-wing anti white causes have been [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1183.14s)]
*  Jewish Americans they went all the way on woke and it wasn't just ADL [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1190.0600000000002s)]
*  It was some of the top Jewish organizations in the country Jewish [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1193.42s)]
*  Carl Marx a Jew too [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1197.5s)]
*  I mean, come on, let's play that play the play the hits Charlie and it would be one thing if Newsom went on there [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1199.02s)]
*  I think Gavin Newsom should answer whether or not he agrees with that and he intends to keep going on to [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1203.98s)]
*  Platforms like that or maybe the adversary like it would be one thing. No, he had Charlie on his show [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1209.5800000000002s)]
*  Charlie on his show [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSThKlgicJA&t=1215.34s)]
