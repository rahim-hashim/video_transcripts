# Zohran Stands Up To Trump's Attack On Free Speech While Cuomo Hides
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4)
*  I was having a conversation with someone who works in this media business, or in political [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=0.0s)]
*  media, who was saying that Andrew Cuomo is a shoe in to win because people remember him [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=3.8200000000000003s)]
*  fighting Trump in COVID and people want somebody who's going to fight Trump. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=9.34s)]
*  Now I don't agree with that statement. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=15.3s)]
*  I'm not trying to jinx anybody. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=17.38s)]
*  God knows I did with... [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=19.06s)]
*  Is that a Mandela effect about what he did during COVID? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=20.86s)]
*  That was Disney adult liberals thinking Cuomo was doing a good job during that period. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=24.72s)]
*  I don't agree with that sentiment. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=29.88s)]
*  Right? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=31.88s)]
*  And... [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=32.88s)]
*  He killed people. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=33.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=34.88s)]
*  And so... [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=35.88s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=36.88s)]
*  No, I was just going to say, although it is a good sort of microcosm for how Democrats [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=37.88s)]
*  use Donald Trump as a way to rehabilitate their tarnished image. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=44.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=49.32s)]
*  And my point really about that is that I don't necessarily think that people have that in [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=50.32s)]
*  their memory. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=57.72s)]
*  If Cuomo does win, it will be because of name recognition and because of the legacy of his [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=59.0s)]
*  father, which was why he kept winning in New York in the first place. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=63.62s)]
*  Yeah, the machine. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=66.78s)]
*  And of machine politics. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=68.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=69.7s)]
*  But I think the only way that Cuomo wins is if this is a lower turnout election. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=70.7s)]
*  And given the rage that I'm seeing in this city and in the country more broadly, I don't [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=76.1s)]
*  think it's going to be a low turnout election. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=80.58s)]
*  Cuomo could still win. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=82.22s)]
*  But if you want somebody that's actually going to fight Donald Trump, I give you Zoran Mahmood. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=83.98s)]
*  Who yesterday confronted Tom Homan, the ICE Gestapo dude to his face. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  Democrats, you want someone that fights Donald Trump? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=100.12s)]
*  Well, watch this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=103.28s)]
*  How many more New Yorkers will you detain? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=104.28s)]
*  How many more New Yorkers will you detain? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=107.28s)]
*  Do you believe in the First Amendment? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=110.28s)]
*  Do you believe in the First Amendment, Tom Homan? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=113.28s)]
*  When we asked Tom Homan, all we had to answer for that cruelty was a smirk. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=116.58s)]
*  Because there is no answer for taking a man from his pregnant wife, who is due to deliver [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=123.94s)]
*  their newborn child in a month from their Columbia University apartment. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=128.82s)]
*  A day after that same man Mahmood Khalil wrote to Columbia University and said he feared [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=132.9s)]
*  for his life. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=138.38s)]
*  The cowardice that is on display across our city and our state is unacceptable. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=140.5s)]
*  New Yorkers are looking to us. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  They are looking to their leaders for courage and for conviction. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  And what they are finding instead is collaboration. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=150.67999999999998s)]
*  And that is just simply unacceptable. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  Zoran Mahmood, Donnie Fermier. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  Folks, I just want to get this out. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  If you're just, this has to be said repeatedly in the coverage of this race, because I think [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=166.67999999999998s)]
*  a lot of people don't know how ranked choice voting works. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  You have to fill out all five slots to maximize the effect of your ballot. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=174.38s)]
*  But if you don't want Cuomo to win, do not rank Cuomo as any of the five people. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=178.38s)]
*  You can rank the other candidates, but make sure you fill out all five slots and put Zoran [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=184.38s)]
*  Mondani at the beginning, at the top. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=189.38s)]
*  We have a real chance to actually win this race. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=192.38s)]
*  This is very reminiscent in my view of the AOC race, which also at the time, the candidate [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  she was challenging, gosh, it's like escaping me already right now, Crowley, was very reliant [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  on low turnout to win his election. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  And a lot of the polls didn't have her down by around 20 points because they didn't account [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  for the fact that so many people turned out for her to win that primary race. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  This is, I think, a very similar strategy that Zoran is deploying. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=225.78s)]
*  And he was in, that was in Albany, by the way, because he's still an assembly member [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=229.78s)]
*  for district 36. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=233.78s)]
*  So he was representing his district up there when he went after Tom Homan. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=234.78s)]
*  This is the kind of guy who would actually fight Donald Trump. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=239.78s)]
*  Your thoughts, folks. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=242.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=244.78s)]
*  Oh, you know, this has happened in the mayoral race recently too, where the insurgent progressive [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=245.78s)]
*  was the one after standing up to, you know, the powers that be. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=253.48s)]
*  I mean, he ended up not being the best, but he was much better than the other mayors we had. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=258.48s)]
*  When Bill de Blasio first ran as mayor, he was the insurgent progressive who everyone [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=262.48s)]
*  said had no chance. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=267.48s)]
*  And then he showed up to protests. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=268.48s)]
*  And he, I think the one that was the jump off for him that got him attention was protesting [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=270.48s)]
*  the closure of a hospital in Manhattan. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=275.48s)]
*  And that was a big moment for him. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=281.18s)]
*  And he won. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=283.18s)]
*  He beat out Michael Bloomberg's literal next in line and like the pick to like the establishment [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=284.18s)]
*  pick, like the one everyone thought was going to win. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=293.18s)]
*  He beat her. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=295.18s)]
*  It could happen again. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=296.18s)]
*  So, you know, people should should go out and vote for Zoran for sure, especially with [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=297.18s)]
*  ring choice voting. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=303.18s)]
*  The odds are especially in his favor. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=304.18s)]
*  And Bill de Blasio is like, you know, a progressive. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=307.88s)]
*  But I would say the most like the candidates most like him in this race right now is Brad [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=310.88s)]
*  Lander, right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=315.88s)]
*  I mean, he's more of an in between in between a Zoran Mondani and an Andrew Cuomo. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=316.88s)]
*  And the point is, is that right now we have somebody who could be like an actual democratic [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=322.88s)]
*  socialist being the mayor of New York City in the city in this country where rental prices [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=328.88s)]
*  are the highest. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=333.88s)]
*  And so it's part of this city where over 50 percent of New Yorkers live well below the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=335.58s)]
*  poverty line when you adjust for things like cost of living. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=340.58s)]
*  There was an analysis done. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=343.58s)]
*  I think it was by Robin Hood and one of the universities here in New York City. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=344.58s)]
*  I can't remember off the top of my head. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=348.58s)]
*  It is absolutely impossible for working families to live in the city where that they're providing [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=352.58s)]
*  value for. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=357.58s)]
*  And what Zoran represents with his rent freeze proposal and with his free bus proposal allows [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=358.58s)]
*  there to be actual cost of living relief for people in this city and not the corruption [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=364.58s)]
*  that has kind of embroiled us all here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=371.08s)]
*  I mean, and that Eric Adams represents so effectively, unfortunately. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=374.08s)]
*  So I want somebody who's actually going to fight Donald Trump. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=378.58s)]
*  And that's not some milquetoast liberal that does it for clicks or for a news conference [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=383.08s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=387.28s)]
*  I mean, hey, he got attention for this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=388.28s)]
*  We love it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=389.28s)]
*  He backed it up both in the policies he supports in his time in the state assembly and then [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=390.28s)]
*  here with his campaign. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=396.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=398.28s)]
*  Did you guys cover the talk about the Andrew Cuomo statement on? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=399.28s)]
*  We didn't. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=404.78s)]
*  It was ridiculous. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=405.78s)]
*  I can pull it up here right now. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=406.78s)]
*  It was completely mealy mouthed. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=408.17999999999995s)]
*  Oh, no, no. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=409.78s)]
*  There's an even worse statement now that came out after. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=410.78s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=413.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=414.78s)]
*  Do you want to put the mealy mouth one up so you can see just how bad he's he's even [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=415.78s)]
*  worse now? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=419.86s)]
*  I'm going to he took it back. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=420.86s)]
*  I'm going to try to find. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=424.86s)]
*  So so yeah, he he Andrew Cuomo basically put out the type of the type of on on the the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=427.36s)]
*  the Palestinian from Colombia. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=435.44s)]
*  I have it here. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=438.56s)]
*  I have his initial statement. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=439.56s)]
*  I'll just read it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=440.56s)]

*  And I unequivocally condemn it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  Constitutional rights are preeminent and facts and evidence must be presented and weighed. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=459.32s)]
*  There are real questions about the wider implications of this detainment. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=462.88s)]
*  Real questions. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  This is like the greatest threat to the First Amendment in terms of a case that I've seen [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  in my lifetime. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=470.59999999999997s)]
*  The federal government and the courts need to be clear with the public about the justification [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=473.85999999999996s)]
*  for their position and actions. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=477.38s)]
*  The rule of law matters and we must not never forget that regardless of the political view [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=478.65999999999997s)]
*  expressed, however important, so I stand for nothing and said nothing specific base. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=483.14s)]
*  Well, I mean, you say a lot when you say what my mood stands for is a parent. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=488.17999999999995s)]
*  It's not a parent. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=493.38s)]
*  It's just and anyone saying it's anti-Semitic or even bad or even that they don't agree [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=494.38s)]
*  with it is telling on themselves. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=499.46s)]
*  This is a mom down. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=502.32s)]
*  He has it exactly right. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=503.4s)]
*  They're looking for courage. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=504.92s)]
*  We are seeing collaboration and people need to understand what that means. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=506.3s)]
*  There are Democrats collaborating with fascism right now. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=511.3s)]
*  That is the reality where this isn't a road to it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=516.7s)]
*  This isn't a road to authoritarianism. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=519.08s)]

*  It is our lives right now. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=523.04s)]
*  There are collaborators trying to help people be disappeared or putting up the barest amount [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=524.96s)]
*  of resistance and still be able to run in a Democratic primary to it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=531.28s)]
*  They are caving to McCarthyism. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=535.0s)]
*  That's what we're seeing right now. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=536.76s)]
*  This is Zionism is the new McCarthyism attacks like on disingenuous suppression of speech [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=537.98s)]
*  of left wing thought and using national security or in this case trumped up charges of anti-Semitism [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=545.8s)]
*  as justification for it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=553.72s)]
*  So yeah, Andrew Cuomo was criticized for that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=555.16s)]
*  Like you said, like mealy mouth like bullshit that he spewed that he put out a statement [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=560.1999999999999s)]
*  and then apparently his response is to actually double down and get even worse on it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=564.92s)]
*  There's no more mealy mouth. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  It's now this was his latest response that came after that on Twitter. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=572.04s)]
*  All New Yorkers, including Jewish New Yorkers deserve equal protection under the law. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  This is especially true in our schools where every student should be able to learn free [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=580.6s)]
*  of discrimination, violence and harassment. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=584.5799999999999s)]
*  The anti-Semitic agitators at Columbia University and on campuses across the country have gone [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=587.26s)]
*  unchecked for too long. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=593.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=596.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean, wow. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=598.02s)]
*  Unchecked for too long. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=600.78s)]
*  You mean in November, 2023 when Columbia University banned Jewish voices for peace and students [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=601.78s)]
*  for Palestine, you mean that that too long because Columbia cracked down on them extremely [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=606.86s)]
*  aggressively, including the Jewish organization that is that Cuomo was basically smearing as [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=613.48s)]
*  anti-Semitic. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=618.48s)]
*  Exactly. It goes without saying that the biggest danger to Jewish voices on that campus were [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=620.12s)]
*  the police who were brought in by Democratic mayors, Republican mayors alike to essentially [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=626.12s)]
*  engage in violent repression of their right to protest. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=631.96s)]
*  And, you know, I hate to take a zoomed out image of this, but this is something that's [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=635.6800000000001s)]
*  going to spread right now. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=639.5200000000001s)]
*  It's anti-Semitic terrorism. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  And in 10 years, as the climate gets worse, it'll be eco-terrorism. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  And like the nebulous definition of terror will be used as it has been used for the past, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=647.52s)]
*  you know, at least my entire lifetime to strip away the civil and human rights of people [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=652.5999999999999s)]
*  who are engaging in any sort of resistance from Western liberal or illiberal ideas. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=658.0s)]
*  But in this case, the expansion of the American imperialist project as manifested in [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=665.52s)]
*  Israel specifically now. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  But again, who knows what that will look like in 10 or 15 years. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=672.8399999999999s)]
*  I want to play this then to that point. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=678.8399999999999s)]
*  Let's we just saw how Zoran here in New York reacted to this. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=681.04s)]
*  But the Trump administration cracking down on free speech and using Mahmoud Khalil [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=686.28s)]
*  as basically the the test case for how they're going to go after a variety of different [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=695.52s)]
*  protest movements is, I think, the right way to to to look at it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=701.36s)]
*  It's also just, I would say, been been enabled by the Democratic Party and the kind of. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=706.16s)]
*  Oh, yes. Yeah. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=714.48s)]
*  I know you're not not contradicting that. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=716.04s)]
*  But here is Tommy Tuberville on with Fox Business. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=718.48s)]
*  And, you know, Tommy Tuberville down in Alabama is just very concerned about anti-Semitism. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=725.56s)]
*  But he's asked by the host of the bottom line on Fox Business about the detention of [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=731.5999999999999s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil. And this is how he reacts. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=738.04s)]
*  This is going to be I think this is the Republican line. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=741.52s)]
*  This is how protesters should be treated. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=745.28s)]
*  As America's once great elite universities plummet to new lows, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=748.8s)]
*  Senate Democrats are more concerned with securing the release of an alleged terrorist [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=754.24s)]
*  sympathizer than rebuilding our academic standards. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=759.64s)]
*  How about just not graduating kids from high school who are functionally illiterate? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=765.04s)]
*  Senate Judiciary Democrats posted on X, quote, free free Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=772.6s)]
*  That was what they actually had the audacity to do. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=780.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. By the way, Alabama, 45th in the country in education out of 50. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=784.36s)]
*  So they brought on the right guy. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=789.68s)]
*  It must be all the teachers unions that are massively empowered in that state. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=791.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. At one point in the interview, Tuberville blames teachers unions, administrators for [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=794.68s)]
*  being the people that are on that not educating the population enough. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=799.6s)]
*  If they got rid of all of the functionally illiterate adults who would watch Fox News? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=804.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, Tommy, Tommy Tuberville would have to leave Congress. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=808.4s)]
*  He doesn't he didn't know what the three branches of government were just last year as a senator. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=811.4s)]
*  Tommy Tuberville quit and was paid like millions of dollars for it. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=816.16s)]
*  Quit college football. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=820.08s)]
*  Yeah. Dems, is it they like that in private, too, because that's atrocious. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=822.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's a shame. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=829.56s)]
*  You know, the Democrats basically, you know, they don't like our country anymore. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=832.04s)]
*  They just want to tear it down. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=835.28s)]
*  They're going to take this guy's side. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=837.48s)]
*  Every Democrat that we work with up here, they're going to take this guy's side and [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=839.08s)]

*  That's not my country. I have no I have nothing to say for Israel, actually. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=850.6800000000001s)]
*  I would rather our government did less for them, frankly. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=854.64s)]
*  And I think it's actually American to say so. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=857.76s)]
*  And conflating America and Israel as the same thing. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=859.84s)]
*  That's weird to me. Well, they're both colonial. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=863.44s)]
*  They're both colonial projects. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=866.12s)]
*  They're ideological sisters. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=867.96s)]

*  He's the people we should be. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=873.16s)]
*  We we should be backing the heck with education. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=874.6s)]
*  You know, we have two levels of education. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=878.04s)]
*  We have K through 12 and we have a higher yet. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=880.4s)]
*  We've got to do both of them different. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=882.88s)]
*  But when it comes to protesters, we got to make sure we treat all of them the same. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=884.52s)]
*  Send them to jail. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=889.08s)]
*  Free speech is great. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=890.8s)]

*  Senator, let's move on to number three. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  Back five seconds. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=915.28s)]

*  Oh, my God. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=951.6400000000001s)]
*  But any time the second you said, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=953.2800000000001s)]
*  you opened up this event with the segment with here's Tommy Tuberville. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=955.32s)]
*  And the second that's all you didn't tell me to know about the dumbest [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=959.88s)]
*  shit I've ever heard of my life. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=962.48s)]
*  But it's it's all the administrators and the unions that are educating our kids. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=965.08s)]
*  I'm sorry, Matt, just really quickly. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=970.0400000000001s)]
*  Can you pull up his quote about or I'll just read it? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=971.5600000000001s)]
*  This is from 2020 about the three branches of government. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=973.9200000000001s)]
*  Tommy Tuberville. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=977.36s)]
*  Yeah. And that's how our government was set up. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=978.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, our government wasn't set up for one group to have all three [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=980.72s)]
*  branches of government. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=983.84s)]
*  It wasn't set up that way. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=985.0s)]
*  Our three branches, the House, the Senate and the executive. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=986.2800000000001s)]
*  So that is not true. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=989.96s)]
*  That is not the three three branches of government. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=991.96s)]
*  He forgot the judiciary and he divided the House and the Senate. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=993.96s)]
*  So maybe he needs a little bit more education. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=997.76s)]
*  And as far as the whole, you know, you're in trouble [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1001.4399999999999s)]
*  if you do hateful stuff during protests. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1004.48s)]
*  First of all, those protests are not hateful. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1006.84s)]
*  It's not hateful to say eradicate the West, particularly when the West is being [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1009.64s)]
*  defined as the billions of dollars to do a genocide in Palestine thing. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1013.24s)]
*  But Trump pardoned a whole bunch of people in mass, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1019.28s)]
*  including the guy that wore a camp Auschwitz shirt to Congress. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1023.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1028.72s)]
*  But I've seen this online where people ask for proof of what did it? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1031.4s)]
*  What did Mamoud Khalil do to to to what is the charge based on? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1035.08s)]
*  Like what? Give me an example. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1040.32s)]
*  And people put together like these long threads of him literally just like [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1042.16s)]
*  talking to the media about why they're protesting, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1046.76s)]
*  divestment, what they're protesting for. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1049.88s)]
*  And it's just like your basic, like activist [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1051.88s)]
*  speech, like there's nothing they can't even provide evidence. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1056.52s)]
*  A single thing, a morsel of evidence that somewhat abstractly backs their claim. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1062.88s)]
*  They got nothing. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1068.72s)]
*  They there's been attempts to make shit up, including like about guns [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1069.76s)]
*  and brochures and stuff. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1073.48s)]
*  And then the Trump administration is actually like, no, that's actually [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1075.08s)]
*  we're not even saying that we're saying he's doing a protest [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1078.08s)]
*  that calls for a university to divest investments from an apartheid state [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1082.28s)]
*  aligns with terrorism. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1088.04s)]
*  I will just repeat. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1090.48s)]
*  Then when and you'll see like people talk about, well, the occupied property, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1091.96s)]
*  the [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1097.56s)]
*  protests against South Africa, which called for the same sort of divestment, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1100.32s)]
*  also occupied halls at the same university. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1103.96s)]
*  It's good to do that for a good cause. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1107.2s)]
*  And it's likewise if you if you are see a segregated lunch counter, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1110.12s)]
*  you violate the property rights and go fucking sit there [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1116.04s)]
*  until the segregation goes away. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1119.32s)]
*  This is what protest is. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1121.08s)]
*  Yep. Right. Exactly. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1122.56s)]
*  But even those protests actions aren't like crimes that would [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1124.12s)]
*  in any sense, at most, it's like a civil infraction. Right. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1127.96s)]
*  I mean, they want to make it illegal to protest. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1132.24s)]
*  They want to make it illegal to exercise your First Amendment rights [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1134.12s)]
*  in this country as things start to get worse and worse economically [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1136.84s)]
*  for the vast majority of Americans. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1140.2399999999998s)]
*  And that money is being publicly funneled to Trump's billionaire friends [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1142.76s)]
*  because they can see the writing on the wall. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1147.28s)]
*  And they understand, I think, that Israel is a very good wedge issue [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1149.2399999999998s)]
*  for Democrats because they're desperate to seem well, I mean, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1152.76s)]
*  a lot of Zionists, but also they're desperate to seem reasonable. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1155.9199999999998s)]
*  And so like they can be easily manipulated into making these incredibly [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1159.56s)]
*  milquetoast statements that give tons of legitimacy to this infringement [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1163.2s)]
*  on the First Amendment, just like they are capable. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1167.28s)]
*  I mean, it's like they're very easily led to give tons of ammo [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1169.76s)]
*  to the far right for like anti-immigration stuff. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1172.8400000000001s)]
*  And they know that like deep down, a lot of Democrats don't understand [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1175.64s)]
*  a difference between anti-Semitism and opposition to Israel, right, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1179.8s)]
*  because they've had that mixed up in their heads through the 20, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1183.28s)]
*  30 years of neoliberal identity politics. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1185.76s)]
*  And so this is going to be a perfect way to get. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1188.16s)]
*  Yeah, and absolutely. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1190.24s)]
*  And it's going to be a perfect way to get a lot of liberals on the side [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1191.6399999999999s)]
*  of the total erosion of the First Amendment in the total demonization [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1194.52s)]
*  in criminalization of protests right before people are going to start [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1199.12s)]
*  really needing to protest in America for their rights, their rights, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1202.8799999999999s)]
*  to have access to basic necessities. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1205.8799999999999s)]
*  And Jewish American activists are trying to do their best to obscure [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1209.1599999999999s)]
*  like that will not obscure it, but shine a light on how that's a falsehood. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1216.1599999999999s)]
*  This is breaking news, but today [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1221.16s)]
*  I think this is a Jewish Voice for Peace and other groups [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1224.3600000000001s)]
*  have basically staged a demonstration at Trump Tower. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1227.76s)]
*  So you can see here, fight Nazis, not students. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1231.96s)]
*  Jews say do not comply in the tower, in the tower with all that gold [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1235.56s)]
*  as escalator where the the Nazi bigot Trump came down saying, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1241.8400000000001s)]
*  so Mexicans are OK when it all began. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1245.92s)]
*  This Trump grill there. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1248.68s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1249.8799999999999s)]
*  I've actually been in this lobby. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1252.08s)]
*  But you hear that. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1253.2s)]
*  God bless everybody showing up to do that. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1258.72s)]
*  And this is what you're so frustrating because all of these news articles [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1266.36s)]
*  like in the Times talk about how vaguely without, you know, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1269.08s)]
*  doing much to back it up, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1274.6s)]
*  talk about how unsafe Jews feel on campus. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1276.92s)]
*  They never talk about the fact that many of these demonstrations [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1279.8400000000001s)]
*  against the genocide in Gaza are led by Jews. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1283.92s)]
*  They leave that out purposefully. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1286.52s)]
*  They do. They do. And sorry, good. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1288.64s)]
*  I was just going to say they lie saying that Jews are barred from campus. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1291.2s)]
*  And what they're actually talking about is certain instigators [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1294.96s)]
*  who are draping Israeli flag and are going to known to go in the encampments [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1298.3200000000002s)]
*  to cause trouble and then film it so they can have propaganda, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1302.16s)]
*  aren't allowed in there to get that propaganda object. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1305.3999999999999s)]
*  And that's what's called barring Jews from a protest, which, like you said, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1307.96s)]
*  disproportionately features Jewish opponents of Israeli policy. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1311.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the goal is obviously not to platform the voices [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1316.9199999999998s)]
*  of every Jewish person. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1319.52s)]
*  That's not the goal of neoliberal politics. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1320.8799999999999s)]
*  It's to have control over the political identity of marginalized groups [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1322.76s)]
*  in order to use that to negotiate some kind of moral and intellectual superiority [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1326.6799999999998s)]
*  over the far right within our like, you know, political duopoly. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1330.84s)]
*  And so if they lose the ability and by they, I mean, like the groups [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1334.2s)]
*  like the ADL groups like APAC, if they lose the ability to effectively [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1337.6000000000001s)]
*  weaponize and homogenize Jewish identity, then, you know, they just can't. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1342.3600000000001s)]
*  They lose their political power. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1346.48s)]
*  They know they lose at least with a large portion of like [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1347.92s)]
*  the more credulous liberals. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1351.28s)]
*  And you see that not with Jewish, not just with Jewish identity, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1352.48s)]
*  but with black identity, with the identity of women, with the identity of LGBTQ [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1355.24s)]
*  people, because like they're they know that a lot of the hardships [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1360.08s)]
*  faced by marginalized groups come in the form of like economic inequality. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1363.76s)]
*  And so at the very least, they have to disallow for those voices [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1368.1999999999998s)]
*  who are going to speak to and like entangle, you know, things like black, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1371.0s)]
*  the struggles of black women in like the economic situation that they're facing [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1375.08s)]
*  and, you know, present a more pro-imperial usually, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1379.04s)]
*  but also just generally spoke post as quote message. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1382.04s)]
*  Yep, it's exactly right. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1386.28s)]
*  And the right is effective at dividing along those lines [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1388.12s)]
*  and using it to distract from immiserating all of this, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1392.9199999999998s)]
*  which the Trump administration is attempting to do on multiple fronts here. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3QboUhbf4&t=1395.9199999999998s)]
