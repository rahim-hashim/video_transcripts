# Republican Admits Israel Was Behind TikTok Ban
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA)
*  Speaking of Ken Klippenstein, he uncovered this or at the very least published this and it was make it made the rounds which is good [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=0.0s)]
*  Because this is a very informative admission. Here's Mike Gallagher a Republican former [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=7.28s)]
*  Representative from Wisconsin. He now works at Palantir. He's here with Senator Mark Warner who you know is very high up in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=15.16s)]
*  Senate foreign relations [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  For some context to Gallagher before he left Congress was the chair of the China subcommittee [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=24.4s)]
*  Because sort of like house and tell committee about select committee on kind of like the threat of China [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=31.36s)]
*  economically and politically and Warner is now ranking member, but he's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=36.44s)]
*  Yeah, he was the chair now ranking member of the Intelligence Committee. All right. Yes, exactly [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=41.8s)]
*  So he they're they're speaking essentially at this conference at the Munich Security Conference [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=45.92s)]
*  Where we'll probably play a little bit of JD dance's speech later [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  And basically they admit what was behind the tick-tock ban in terms of the true motivations [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  Mike how did that? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=63.68s)]
*  Legislation passed so quickly if this is correct and there's not a lot of people to understand [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=65.52s)]
*  Somebody understood something. I was even gonna tell the real story [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=71.16s)]
*  Okay, the real so well first of all at the record [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=74.64s)]
*  Like talk legislation I'd left no AI legislation senator I left to produce more human beings and they cost money [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=76.64s)]
*  They're not making me money and if everyone had followed Frank in my Irish Catholic lead and repopulated the earth [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=83.76s)]
*  We would have already won this Cold War competition [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=89.92s)]
*  How did it pass so quickly I know running out time [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=94.44s)]
*  One we stole the senators work and he did a lot of the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=96.84s)]
*  Sincerely a lot of yeoman's work in in drafting an initial bill [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=101.36s)]
*  We were able to sort of learn from that experience. We were fine the approach we worked with him [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  We work with the executive branch so we had a bipartisan consensus [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=110.08s)]
*  We had the executive branch, but the bill was still dead until October 7th and people started to see a bunch of anti-semitic [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  Content on the platform and our bill [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=121.6s)]
*  And then there was a huge miscalculation by tick-tock when it became apparent that we were going to pass it out of committee [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  They forced sort of a pop-up on the app that allowed people to call their members of Congress [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=130.68s)]
*  Calling into their members of Congress during school hours [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=136.2s)]
*  So [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=140.68s)]
*  We'll go back ten seconds [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=141.76s)]
*  I just want to lay out what was just admitted to there is that October 7th because it was showing after the fact a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=143.24s)]
*  Pro-palestinian narrative, which is just the reality [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  meaning that these are people who are the victims of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=155.88s)]
*  American and Israeli [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=160.32s)]
*  ethnic cleansing and genocide and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=162.56s)]
*  Here are the horrible images that you're gonna see on your phone [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=165.04s)]
*  I think it had a real effect on the election in the sense that the party that was responsible for this lost [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=167.76s)]
*  Decided they'd rather support Israel than win an election and it's not folks that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=174.2s)]
*  Went to the ballot box and voted for the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=179.6s)]
*  Republican that are really the problem although there were I'm sure some some folks that did that with Trump [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=182.16s)]
*  it was a lot of people that stayed home and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=186.24s)]
*  This is an admission here by somebody who now works for Palantir former Republican [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=189.6s)]
*  that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=194.56s)]
*  What got it over the finish line and got it into the bill that included Ukraine and Israel funding for weapons [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=195.92s)]
*  Was the fact that it was showing too much of a pro-palestinian and he would say anti-semitic narrative on [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=202.84s)]
*  Tik-tok now Palantir. It's important to note [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  Is founded by Peter Thiel Peter Thiel is a major investor in Facebook [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=212.92s)]
*  Or was at the outset. I'm not sure what his [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=220.88s)]
*  Position is right now, but at the very least he's made billions from from Facebook and now meta [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=224.48s)]
*  Guess what's metas biggest competitor? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  tik-tok [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=232.64s)]
*  because Instagram is [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=234.32s)]
*  The app that would benefit the most from tik-tok being banned [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=236.72s)]
*  That's pretty important to disclose that he works for Palantir now [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  Which was founded by the same guy who has a major stake in Facebook [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=244.88s)]
*  biggest competitor to tik-tok and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  Yes, he was on the board of meta until he left in 2022 Peter Thiel did but I would not be shocked if you know [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=252.8s)]
*  I doubt he stole sold all of what he has invested in there in that but either way [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=259.64s)]
*  Let's go back a little bit and so this is the rest of this is be clear to people. This is Democrat Senator Mark Warner. Yep [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=266.16s)]
*  who [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  Started all the work on this and then it got pushed to the finish line by Palantir person [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=275.76s)]
*  From Virginia Mark Warner where a lot of our weapons manufacturing and that kind of lobbying happens [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=280.96s)]
*  Came apparent that we were going to pass it out of committee [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=288.36s)]
*  They forced sort of a pop-up on the app that allowed people to call their members of Congress [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=290.56s)]
*  And kids were calling into their members of Congress during school hours threatening to commit suicide [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=295.16s)]
*  If tik-tok went away and for those of us who are concerned about the use of this platform for propaganda [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=299.48s)]
*  Purposes or brainwashing it sort of proved the point in the moment and suddenly the bill test [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=305.56s)]
*  So it was the threat of espionage the threat of propaganda the good work of Senator Warner [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  And a few other players that all conspired and he got it out of a committee [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=315.32s)]
*  That is the most diverse in the house. Oh good to write [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=319.12s)]
*  50 to 0 after a class fight. Yeah, that was a he did a video. It was a it was [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  evil [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=329.88s)]
*  People would not about but he and his his Democratic colleagues did some great great [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=330.84s)]
*  But to your point about democracy, I mean that was a three-year endeavor of and it failed [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=335.28s)]
*  You know a hundred times and we just had to keep working at him working it. So let me do this. We are [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=339.32s)]
*  Do you think that woman in the middle is a little bit like you guys revealed a bit too much here as you're talking about [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=346.28s)]
*  democracy and like [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=351.64s)]
*  We banned this app because there was too much information and free speech on it that we didn't like anyway [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=354.32s)]
*  The Free Speech Party the Republican Party that I represent no contradiction there want to talk about [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=359.7s)]
*  Propaganda there was a shooting down in Miami. I guess it was a few days ago [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=366.74s)]
*  horrific [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=372.54s)]
*  I think that they killed this guy killed two Israeli tourists. I don't know if they're dead or not [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=374.26s)]
*  Okay, we won't we won't I guess then go into more of the details on this but there was a shooting that was [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=379.42s)]
*  Ashkenazi Jews shot to Mizrahi Jews thinking they were Arabs and then now the the Mizrahi Jews are saying that they were [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=386.42s)]
*  Were shot by a Palestinian [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=393.38s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=395.9s)]
*  Zionism tick tock do that or was that Zionism Zionism is the acute threat of hatred to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=397.54s)]
*  confront in the world right now and it is actually [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=404.5s)]
*  Motivated policy towards censorship and JD Vance is marching around Europe talking about all how bad [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=408.74s)]
*  censorship is not saying a thing about [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=415.94s)]
*  Suppressing speech that is critical of Israel because he supports that because the way they use censorship is as if as a stolen bike [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=420.62s)]
*  That they're gonna ditch the second [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=427.78s)]
*  It's not useful to them anyone who's pandering to the right that their free speech stuff is sincere [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=429.38s)]
*  Should is probably taking money from rumble. Yeah. Well at the same conference you teed that up perfectly Matt [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=436.14s)]
*  Here's JD Vance [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=442.58s)]
*  Munich Security Conference this got this pissed off a lot of people in Europe [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=444.09999999999997s)]
*  Over the weekend, but this part in particular [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=448.62s)]
*  bothers me [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=451.78s)]
*  and it bothered folks in Germany because [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=453.78s)]
*  Here he is [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=458.14s)]
*  Speaking about the dangers of shutting people out of the political process. You may wonder what he's talking about [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=459.82s)]
*  well, he [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=465.86s)]
*  Makes it quite clear. He uses the word firewall and that's very important [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=467.78s)]
*  Because he's referring to the fact that in German [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=472.65999999999997s)]
*  politics certain political parties are subjected to a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=475.9s)]
*  Firewall, which means that if you are too Holocaust and naive [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=480.06s)]
*  We're not gonna work with you and that includes although it's kind of falling apart right now as conservatives in Germany begin to entertain doing what? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=484.09999999999997s)]
*  Musk is actually pressuring them to do [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=491.97999999999996s)]
*  They are [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=496.18s)]
*  potentially gonna work with this AFD party even though [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=497.82s)]
*  They're not supposed to because they've engaged in the Holocaust denial [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=501.54s)]
*  To to form a far-right government with the elections coming up in a few weeks and this is much [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=507.02s)]
*  I mean JD Vance but doing the work of Elon Musk who spoke at the AFD rally [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=514.86s)]
*  The same week he did that Nazi salute at the inauguration because they're trying to elevate this particular far-right element [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=520.94s)]
*  So Vance goes in and basically election interferes and does the same thing as the vice president of the United States [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=528.5799999999999s)]
*  the dismissing people dismissing their concerns or worse yet shutting down media shutting down elections or [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=536.3s)]
*  Shutting people out of the political process [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=544.2199999999999s)]
*  protects nothing [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=547.9s)]
*  in fact, it is the most surefire way to destroy democracy and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=549.6999999999999s)]
*  Speaking up and expressing opinions isn't election interference [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=555.7s)]
*  Even when people express views outside your own country and even when those people are very influential [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=560.0600000000001s)]
*  And trust me. I say this with all humor if American democracy can survive 10 years of Greta Thunberg [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=567.26s)]
*  scolding you guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk. Can you pause it? All right [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=574.38s)]
*  this [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=579.58s)]
*  Disingenuous twerp [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=582.1800000000001s)]
*  Greta Thunberg is not the richest man on the planet [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=585.18s)]
*  She's an activist who has had a mostly organic [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=589.4599999999999s)]
*  rise to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=594.8199999999999s)]
*  prominence that I would say it's mostly organic because yeah [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=596.8199999999999s)]
*  There were some maybe liberal institutions that liked her when she spoke out some years ago and led protests when she came over to the United States [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=600.26s)]
*  on [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=608.4599999999999s)]
*  That solar-powered boat [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=609.5s)]
*  But for the most part she's kind of dropped off in terms of media coverage here domestically because she has spent the past few years [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=611.34s)]
*  Being critical of Israel's genocide in Gaza [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=619.4200000000001s)]
*  All she has is the power of her voice and her social media presence what Elon Musk has is a social media platform and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=622.86s)]
*  The most money that one human being has currently on the planet [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=630.9000000000001s)]
*  So the power of Congress apparently yeah prominence versus power like right Greta had prominence [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=635.5799999999999s)]
*  But what did she actually get to do with it like? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=642.14s)]
*  Other than she's weird as anti-semite by some freak Zionists for having an octopus in the background of whatever shot [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=645.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's not working [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  You're about to what withdraw from the Paris climate accords [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=654.4599999999999s)]
*  We crossed the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold that sets off the horrific chain reaction of weather events and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=657.82s)]
*  Destroys a lot of her biodiversity that she was warning about many years ago [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=665.7s)]
*  Has she won like we're gonna really compare the power of a teenager from Sweden who got famous for her activism with the guy [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=669.5s)]
*  Who has the most money on the planet? This is how I'm making spy satellite. Yes. This is how the right [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=677.0200000000001s)]
*  pretends like this these power dynamics are [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=682.6600000000001s)]
*  Non-existent and anything that occurs from that is natural so and so are we gonna get to it like the part where we're talking about the firewall [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=686.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, let's get to that. It's just that that triggered me the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=694.34s)]
*  so so disingenuous [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=697.82s)]
*  With all humor if American democracy can survive ten years of Greta Thunberg scolding [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=700.22s)]
*  You guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=706.62s)]
*  Crickets, but what German democracy? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=710.6600000000001s)]
*  What no democracy American German or European will survive is [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=713.62s)]
*  Telling millions of voters that their thoughts and concerns their aspirations their pleas for relief are [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=718.66s)]
*  invalid or unworthy of even being considered [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=725.26s)]
*  Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=729.9399999999999s)]
*  There's no room for firewalls you either uphold the principle or you don't [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=735.42s)]
*  Europeans the people have a voice [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=742.1s)]
*  European leaders have a choice and my strong belief is that we do not need to be afraid of the future [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=745.82s)]
*  Okay, don't be afraid of the future unburden yourself from your past [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=754.22s)]
*  I say in Munich as I endorse a far-right party that [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=758.26s)]
*  is [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=762.66s)]
*  extremist in its rhetoric against immigrants and [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=764.18s)]
*  Like they are scapegoating Germany's failure to basically be continued [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=766.86s)]
*  Economic power they can't fucking make cars anymore Germany [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=773.6600000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's an overstatement, but they're not selling as well as they used to they're scapegoating that on immigrants [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=778.2600000000001s)]
*  Just like JD Vance and all the folks here are doing it's very simple. What's happening and Germans should know that [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=783.46s)]
*  Playbook a little bit better and look I don't know I think Germany is a little bit better [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=790.0200000000001s)]
*  And look, I don't know I think Germans sort of suppress [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=794.78s)]
*  I think Germany's frankly failed to confront its Nazi past not just the measures of [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=798.7s)]
*  Like the anti Holocaust now stuff, I think that stuff is very understandable [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=805.62s)]
*  but when you are supporting an Israeli genocide of Palestinians and [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=810.22s)]
*  Suppressing anybody who criticizes that criminalizing them [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=815.46s)]
*  Stopping speeches was that wasn't very focus supposed to speak in Germany wasn't that German? I believe so [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=818.54s)]
*  You failed and but that's the actual problem and JD Vance isn't actually here to help that failure. He's here to [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=824.38s)]
*  Accelerated and the firewall he wants is the continued one suppressing [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=832.18s)]
*  Speech critical of Israel and just let the Nazis walk Vance went to a [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=837.9s)]
*  On the same day. He said that thing about the firewall. He went to a concentration camp [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=842.9s)]
*  concentration camp and [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=847.98s)]
*  Then met with why Dell one of the AFD leaders and did not meet with Schultz the actual Chancellor. Sorry [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=849.98s)]
*  Sorry, it wasn't the same day as the speech he on the same day. He met with the AFD leader [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=855.54s)]
*  He went to a concentration camp [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=859.9399999999999s)]
*  How and then went to meet with Alice White L as opposed to all of Schultz who actually leads the country [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=862.3399999999999s)]
*  But to Matt's point about like where we failed that kind of empty gesture towards the Holocaust [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=867.3s)]
*  Which is really just like World War two memorialization from our end because there's no systemic [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=873.66s)]
*  Now analysis or reckoning with fascism reason to use the military is aware [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=880.18s)]
*  Right is a way to cover up the fact that the modern Nazi is also a Zionist [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=884.9399999999999s)]
*  and the modern Nazi is a Zionist and [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=892.26s)]
*  The modern Nazis engaging in the Holocaust Nile in the current current in the current form and the modern Nazi is the border fascist [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=895.06s)]
*  the modern Nazi Nazi talks about how [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=902.82s)]
*  Muslims are inherently barbaric and their religion is going to pervert us and come for our women [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=906.9000000000001s)]
*  The modern Nazi wants the migrant to draw drown in the sea and that's what's happening in Europe right now [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=912.5400000000001s)]
*  So don't be fooled by Usha Vans and JD going and paying lip service to the Holocaust [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=919.0200000000001s)]
*  Because they are endorsing a Holocaust as we speak as is the entire Republican Party and [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=926.1s)]
*  Many members of the Democratic Party. Yeah, and exactly right to point the Zionist [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=933.38s)]
*  Influence in this Dave Rubin had a guy David Friedman on who's believe Israeli diplomat [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=939.26s)]
*  closely after October 7th and his solution was [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=944.82s)]
*  Stop accepting refugees [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=948.1s)]
*  We started accepting refugees why yeah because of the fucking Holocaust [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=950.9s)]
*  And yet we get Zionist diplomats going on right-wing shows in America to say actually [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=955.74s)]
*  you need to do what we do is build more walls and [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnJA1lTQJCA&t=962.38s)]
