# Chilling Final Moment Captured Before IDF Boards Gaza Flotilla
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74)
*  A flotilla of I think it was 11 people on on board [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have 11 12 [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=5.08s)]
*  Greta Thunberg Greta Thunberg and others left [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=9.0s)]
*  from Italy, I believe it was [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=14.88s)]
*  It's the book of the boat called the Madeline and it left from Sicily about a week ago [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=20.96s)]
*  It stopped on Thursday to rescue four migrants who had jumped overboard to being detained by the Libyan Coast Guard [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=28.3s)]
*  Here is a clip should we start with [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=39.54s)]
*  Here's the picture I saw last night [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=43.14s)]
*  Which was just yeah horrifying image to see on the timeline of them all with their hands up supposed by Abby Martin the last image [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  Of the God's flotilla before all communications dropped in Israeli commandos [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=51.18s)]
*  Storm the ship you can just see them with their life preservers in their hands up [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=55.64s)]
*  Yeah, Abby Martin did an interview with one of the members of the flotilla [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  You should go and see the entire interview [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=63.92s)]
*  But here's the first couple of minutes just to get you see you get a sense of of what they're attempting to do [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=67.16s)]
*  I mean, obviously they're not capable of bringing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=73.06s)]
*  Even remotely close to enough aid to help folks there [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=77.84s)]
*  But that's all they're bringing a is aid to be clear and be they're trying to inspire others [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=82.92s)]
*  obviously to pay attention to the horrific circumstances that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=91.08s)]
*  Palestinians are in because of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=96.24s)]
*  The Israeli assault the Israeli [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=100.56s)]
*  Preventing of aid getting into Gaza and so on [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=104.56s)]
*  You are halfway to Gaza right now if all eyes on deck the Madeline talk about who is with you and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=108.94s)]
*  What you guys are carrying we made a commitment that will be bringing the aid [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=114.30000000000001s)]
*  Together with the community and we'll be doing this in a very transparent way for everyone to see [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=119.06s)]
*  Every single bag of rice that we put on board our boat. So we're carrying food. We're carrying medicine [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  We are carrying crutches. We are carrying prosthetics for amputated [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=130.9s)]
*  We're carrying water filters and instead of like design is do that they carry bombs that have been signed by very cruel people [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=134.26s)]
*  The community in Catania in Italy, they signed on the flower bags the rice bags sending messages of love to Gaza [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=143.1s)]
*  Despite our small size the greatness of this mission is that in solidarity with the Palestinian people [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=151.86s)]
*  We are being the vanguard to open a people's humanitarian quarter [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=157.42s)]
*  Even if we were in a kayak, but we are opening away or more boats to join later [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=161.2s)]
*  It would be already worse the mission, but we are in a mission of so people [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=166.32s)]
*  Moving a lot of stuff and a lot of solidarity around the world of people who are finally understanding the 18 year old siege [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=171.44s)]
*  The eight decades genocide as well. And yeah, we're pushing for it. That's nothing too. That's gonna stop us now [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=179.06s)]
*  it is amazing to see this diverse and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=185.6s)]
*  Israelis have aborted the ship they have kept them on the boat their reports [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  It's unclear exactly and I don't know, you know what the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=196.92s)]
*  We've heard varying reports. I think drop site [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=200.56s)]
*  Said that they were forcing them to watch videos of October 7th [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  Now understand there's no authority that Israel has to board this ship [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=214.16s)]
*  None that's recognized by [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=218.68s)]
*  The [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=222.4s)]
*  They're international community there in international waters and it's carrying aid it's flagged as a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=225.4s)]
*  UK ship and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=232.12s)]
*  Everyone on board has no weapons and it was in international waters. This is not legal [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=234.48s)]
*  What Israel is doing? I said this earlier on the show, but they were [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=240.24s)]
*  Circling the boat you're you know, if you were caught I was following this a little bit last night in real time [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=244.6s)]
*  The they were circling the boat with drones for hours [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=251.08s)]
*  According to some of the people on board who were communicating with folks on the outside [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=254.6s)]
*  They were drones that are considered to be lethal as a way to scare them at one point [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=258.6s)]
*  They sprayed paint on the boat from above as an intimidation tactic [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=263.8s)]
*  But also it's sometimes done so that drones can see ships [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=268.72s)]
*  More easily via their cameras overhead so they all had to go under [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=272.92s)]
*  For safety because these are drones that could have been armed and could have in theory shot them and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=279.8s)]
*  That's when we saw that image of them like that was the last image the telegram [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=285.8s)]
*  Stream showed of them all putting their hands up before they were taken and I mean if you have any doubt as to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=290.04s)]
*  What's going on here [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=299.0s)]
*  Just contemplate [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=301.4s)]
*  Whether that ship landing in on a beach in Gaza [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=304.08s)]
*  Would have made any material difference [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=309.72s)]
*  to Israel [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=312.92s)]
*  12 people [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=315.56s)]
*  They were very transparent about what's on board all [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=318.12s)]
*  Humanitarian stuff would it have made any material difference? No Israel is illegally border boarding [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=321.48s)]
*  Illegally detaining these people because they do not they want to stamp out any hope [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=329.44s)]
*  Or of providing any type of aid to the Palestinians they want to stamp out any [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=339.0s)]
*  Notion that pillow Palestinians have any humanity that is worth providing aid for or that's what's going on here [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=346.88s)]
*  The idea too that other ships could follow I mean part of a part of like not just the trying to stamp out [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=355.16s)]
*  Any any humanity but also the signal to other nations as you get some leaders in Europe? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=362.88s)]
*  starting to slightly change their tone like this was this sailboat, you know Greta doesn't travel using anything except like solar and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=369.96s)]
*  renewable, so it took seven days for them to get there and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=378.36s)]
*  That this was a part of showing that like hey international community, maybe we need to start just going there [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=382.16s)]
*  Maybe we need to start just going there because [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  Like we talk about our heroism the United States in World War two and yes, we came late [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=393.96000000000004s)]
*  But we were on the right side of history [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=400.20000000000005s)]
*  Like what would we be doing if the situation if we were on the other side and we weren't committing genocide? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  Or what would I want my country to do? I would want us to send [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=408.56s)]
*  Because we're a military superpower [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=412.96s)]
*  Armed ships to bring people food and aid because there's a chance that they're a great majority of them are going to die [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=415.48s)]
*  Within the next few months. We don't even know how many are dead as we keep saying [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=423.76s)]
*  So it's just like immensely important what they're doing and brave brave brave brave [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=428.0s)]
*  It's being minimized by Zionists and leading Britain's conversation some I guess online platform [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=432.48s)]
*  Politics news site said that thing about they're gonna make them watch October 7th [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=439.16s)]
*  Well, they call it they saw selfie yacht and put this picture up. This is from a shameless Malik of Sally [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=443.4s)]
*  Points out all the at the port of Gaza [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=448.96s)]
*  All these kids holding up the pictures of the people who are on the so-called selfie yacht and it seems to me that they felt [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=451.44s)]
*  You know something from those people and you can just see the pan the buildings just destroyed in the background like that like [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=458.46s)]
*  Crazy image. I love how bad the Zionists are at this [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=464.73999999999995s)]
*  These really two are at this like propaganda selfie yacht [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=469.26s)]
*  That wasn't a thing before you said it and that they think it doesn't make Israel look crazy that they're making these people watch October 7th [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=472.06s)]
*  Footage like oh, yeah, the selfie yacht. We all know what that means [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=479.73999999999995s)]
*  These people are just doing it for their what? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=484.82s)]
*  It's just she what she's an influencer or something Greta. Sure. No one buys that [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=488.7s)]
*  You want to play that clip? No, it's I mean basically it's it's just Greta [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=494.29999999999995s)]
*  Asking it was a pre-recorded video. She shared I think with Zateo like in case we get taken [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=499.14s)]
*  Please put pressure on the Swedish government for my release. There are also I think half a dozen French citizens on board [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=505.46s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=512.98s)]
*  Has put out a statement of concern but this has to be something that like if you're a French citizen [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=514.78s)]
*  Put pressure on your government to do this [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=519.9399999999999s)]
*  Haaretz reported [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=522.54s)]
*  three hours ago that [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=524.3s)]
*  the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=526.9s)]
*  Gaza flotilla activists have not been brought to port over 12 hours after the IDF [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=528.1s)]
*  Seized the boat so we don't know what's going on with them and this was a risk that they took like a heroic [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=533.26s)]
*  Historic action trying to break the siege to show what's possible [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=540.2s)]
*  Do you want to play that footage there was hundreds of people hundreds not thousands [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=549.4s)]
*  Not ten thousands, but there were some Israelis marching I guess over the weekend [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=555.64s)]
*  and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=561.44s)]
*  As far as I can tell it is the first [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=562.92s)]
*  March I've seen [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=566.88s)]
*  Where it was explicitly about? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=569.04s)]
*  the Palestinians [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=573.88s)]
*  Who are centering the Palestinians in a protest as opposed to? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=576.04s)]
*  We want the hostages back obviously I can understand why people would be marching to have their hostages returned [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=584.36s)]
*  but [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=592.2s)]
*  This is the first [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=593.56s)]
*  I've I have seen I would imagine there have been some [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=595.48s)]
*  But I don't know if this explicit because I probably the most substantial [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=600.24s)]
*  Hundreds of people marching in Tel Aviv with photos of Palestinian children killed in Gaza [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  I [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=611.2s)]
*  Did also note [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=612.6s)]
*  That in a pride celebration [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=615.0s)]
*  There was an LGBTQ [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=618.36s)]
*  Parade and apparently they were told no [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=621.2800000000001s)]

*  in that [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=632.6s)]
*  Parade but here are some folks who came out [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=635.0799999999999s)]
*  Is there are some people who are coming out in Israel and protesting against their war [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=639.48s)]
*  Centering the victims of that war [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=648.1999999999999s)]
*  I [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=654.28s)]
*  Mean it looks like there's a couple of thousand people there [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=675.16s)]
*  That's a good I saw that there was a report that on the Egyptian side [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=677.64s)]
*  There are people flying into Cairo [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=683.32s)]
*  June 15th, which is this upcoming Sunday apparently there's gonna be a bunch of folks that march to the Rafa [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=685.64s)]
*  Border, which is the you know [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=694.44s)]
*  southernmost border of Gaza that board borders Egypt. I'm thinking of their safety too [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=697.24s)]
*  but it's it's important that in Israel they start to center Palestinians not just because [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=702.72s)]
*  Like of course we want the hostages back but because it not just because [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  It puts to lie or shows how the Israeli government using the hostages as a pretext which they're not even doing anymore [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=713.48s)]
*  Was a lie they're beginning to beginning to understand the humanity of Palestinians within Israel is important because of what eventually has to happen [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=721.16s)]
*  Which is a once democratic state from the river to the sea where? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=728.56s)]
*  They're not just your neighbors right which is I think more of the liberal Zionist way that it's discussed [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=732.8s)]
*  Your neighbor would be somebody that has equal rights property rights next to you [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=738.48s)]
*  that [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=743.52s)]
*  Is in some way equal to you? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=744.56s)]
*  No, they are being oppressed by the Israelis and the more [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=746.88s)]
*  Palestinians that get talked about in a way that is like compassionate the more than we can talk about like [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=751.36s)]
*  How does this eventually resolve itself at the end of this genocide? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=757.4399999999999s)]
*  Which is hopefully yeah [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=761.44s)]
*  Integration racial integration in the end to the apartheid and occupation [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=763.5200000000001s)]
*  DSA Aaron in Atlanta was that march about the hostages are actually for Palestinians [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=766.72s)]
*  It was as far as I understand it Palestinians [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=771.12s)]
*  Not that Aaron there haven't been that many people in Israel centering Palestine in their anti-war protests [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=774.1600000000001s)]
*  But these aren't the first ones the activist community is small [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=779.36s)]
*  But mighty and they need all the support they will we can give them exactly [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=782.72s)]
*  I mean [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=786.96s)]
*  Yeah [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=788.08s)]
*  And I mean more support than just I think what the western press likes to do is which is maybe defend their right to do [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=788.72s)]
*  It or say they should be allowed to no, they're right those people in Israel. That's the Israelis who should be [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=794.08s)]
*  promoted in terms of the path forward for that nation and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=800.08s)]
*  Instead we have to deal both sides things or minimize sort of like who's actually in power in Israel and it's not those people [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=804.48s)]
*  Uh, not nick fuentes just wanted to point out to the conservatives out there that there are outraged protesters [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=812.24s)]
*  Outraged that are outraged by protesters waving the mexican flag [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=818.72s)]
*  That it's waved by a press community in los angeles is a sign of their national origin as [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=822.64s)]
*  we [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=828.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we don't uh, you know have any issue with people waving mexican flags and anybody who does is a loser [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOyBfeHCP74&t=829.68s)]
