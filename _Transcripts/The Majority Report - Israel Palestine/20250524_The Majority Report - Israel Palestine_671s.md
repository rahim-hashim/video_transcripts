# If This Video Bothers You, You Might Be Lacking Empathy
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA)
*  Just to give you a sense of how [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=0.0s)]
*  Vicious and disingenuous and dangerous [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=4.16s)]
*  these [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=10.08s)]
*  Zionist apologists are in this country and folks like that in the conflation of anti-semitism and Zionism [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=12.84s)]
*  We're gonna play a video that you should know is [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=21.04s)]
*  Maybe [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=26.32s)]
*  Incredibly offensive to people [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=28.32s)]
*  that has created so much controversy and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=31.04s)]
*  the main subject in the video is [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=35.84s)]
*  Has been relentlessly attacked [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  for what a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=43.4s)]
*  Lot of these people perceive as [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  anti-semitism [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=48.64s)]
*  And I just want to give you a heads-up a trigger warning because it's gonna be disturbing for people [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=50.64s)]
*  To see this type of video [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=56.96s)]
*  the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  Perpetrator of this video is a woman named [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=62.48s)]
*  Rachel we're only gonna give her first name [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=67.72s)]
*  and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=70.96s)]
*  This is apparently a collaboration with the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=73.28s)]
*  Palestinian Children Relief Fund this video has caused [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=76.84s)]
*  such controversy [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  because of of the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=84.12s)]
*  Undertones of this I think you can you can tell one-sided [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=86.76s)]
*  It's extremely obviously [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=90.44s)]
*  It's dangerous. And so again if you have [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=93.96s)]
*  Children in the room or anything like that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=98.0s)]
*  Here this is a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=102.4s)]
*  Show yeah with a little girl or a half who was able to get out of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=104.56s)]
*  Gaza early [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=110.4s)]
*  And you'll see that she has two prosthetic legs [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=112.48s)]
*  Let's go back to sleep, aha [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=117.44s)]
*  Let's pretend to sleep [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=139.56s)]
*  What? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=146.94s)]
*  Let's hop again! [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=149.08s)]
*  Hop little bunnies hop hop hop hop little bunnies hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=150.08s)]
*  hop hop hop and stop! [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=154.66000000000003s)]
*  Yay! [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=157.66000000000003s)]
*  That was so much fun! [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=158.66000000000003s)]
*  The [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=166.28s)]
*  ghouls coming after this woman for providing children in Palestine some like momentary relief [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=178.28s)]
*  from the absolute horrors that they're going through and the idea that people would be [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=189.24s)]
*  attacking this woman for doing something like this shows such a demented perspective on the world. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=195.56s)]
*  I mean, it's just stunning to me. The CNN interviewed her and the mother of this girl, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=207.16s)]
*  and she has two brothers and they're still in Gaza with their father, and they were saying, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=215.88s)]
*  the mother was saying, because thankfully she was able to be evacuated because the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=221.24s)]
*  Palestinian Children Relief Fund and Miss Rachel partnered with them, that they see videos of her [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=224.68s)]
*  eating bread and they're jealous of their sister or sad about it, basically, not jealous in a bad [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=231.4s)]
*  way, but just that those kids are still over there. And can we just pull up this New York Times article [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=237.56s)]
*  I sent about this? This came out last week. First of all, Miss Rachel is like, I mean, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=243.4s)]
*  she's doing amazing, amazing work humanizing Palestinian kids. She has like 15 million, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=250.52s)]
*  14 million subscribers over a billion views. And I was wondering, like, I was thinking, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  how do I remember that song, the little bunny's thing? And it's because my cousin's kid is always [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=261.32s)]
*  dancing to it. Can you imagine having to defend making the plight of children in Gaza a primary [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=266.84s)]
*  focus on our social media feeds? Like, just even the way that this is framed in the New York Times, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=276.52s)]
*  as if she waded into the Gaza debate. The big debate about it. The big debate as to how many [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=286.67999999999995s)]
*  children should we maim? How many children should we kill? What is the right number of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=293.16s)]
*  Palestinian children to die? What's the best age for them to die at? I mean, is that the debate? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=299.56s)]
*  What's the debate here? Yeah, you'll read an infuriating quote in a sec. Just if you could [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=306.36s)]
*  scroll to the photo of her, where they see them, there you go. That's them together. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=311.32000000000005s)]
*  And, Ra'Haf's mother and yeah, sorry, that's not the right quote. I was reading the wrong one. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=319.23999999999995s)]
*  But anyway, you can see that they met in person and how happy she was. But there was a quote that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=327.23999999999995s)]
*  went viral because stop anti-Semitism. Anti-Semite of the week said stop anti-Semitism. I mean, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=333.08s)]
*  it's just really dark. But this person, Stacey Hackner, was quoted, put her name to it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=341.56s)]
*  Miss Rachel seems to be someone who is really, really good hearted. But in the context of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  everything that's going on, she says, I care about all children. But really, she's talking about the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=355.24s)]
*  children of Gaza. Stacey Hackner, a teacher at a London, a school of Jewish instruction, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=360.04s)]
*  says in an interview, said in an interview that has left a lot of Jewish parents feeling quite [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=367.8s)]
*  isolated. So you don't speak for Jewish parents for your inhumanity. This is a time for everyone [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=373.56s)]
*  to say, quote, really, really good hearted. But in the context of everything, what's everything is a [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=381.72s)]
*  genocide. I mean, and then even the way the Times phrases this, a review of a Curzo's Instagram [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=387.0s)]
*  post over the past 18 months show that her activism has focused primarily on Gaza children. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=393.16s)]
*  So good. You fact checked it. She did, yes, highlight the plight of the children [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=399.96000000000004s)]
*  in experiencing a Holocaust right now. Yes. Disproportionately. I mean, God forbid. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  You saw how the New York Times covered Hitler. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  Um, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=413.32s)]
*  Miss Heathen, a YouTuber, Noah Sampson has been doing a live stream for a week straight to raise [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=419.88s)]
*  funds for UNWA. He took breaks and he's been doing it for Palestinians who are suffering in Gaza to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=425.0s)]
*  avoid famine. They've raised nearly a half a million dollars. Noah is live right now. We should [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=430.2s)]
*  put a link to that. I don't know that guy, but let's put a link to that. Check out a couple of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=434.91999999999996s)]
*  those. I'm surprised it's been going so long. Yeah. Hope he's getting enough sleep. That's [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=439.48s)]
*  amazing. The bestest leftist. My 10 year old daughter was asking me how much it costs to [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=442.92s)]
*  end world hunger. I told, I tell her 6 billion and all about Elon Musk broken promise and then [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=447.96000000000004s)]
*  overpayment for Twitter instead. She said, dad, if I have 7 billion, I'd spend 6 billion to end [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=452.6s)]
*  word or world hunger. Hope? Uh, question mark. I mean, is she good at business? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=457.96000000000004s)]
*  Sounds like a sucker. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=464.36s)]
*  Blaise Chadwell. Uh, miss Rachel also regularly posts in support of Israeli children that were [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=470.92s)]
*  affected on October 7th and other events. She just doesn't post, uh, she doesn't just post about [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=476.44s)]
*  Palestinians. Um, bingo dongo absolute ghouls on Israeli Tik Tok were making fun of the girl in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=481.40000000000003s)]
*  the Ms. Rachel video. They really have no problem letting the world know who they are. And yet they [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=488.28000000000003s)]
*  are confused about why public opinion is against them. No, that clip just really got me because [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=492.84s)]
*  there's no reason that she should be, um, not have her legs anymore, but she's still a little kid. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=497.96s)]
*  How excited she is to see. To enjoy her life. And the, um, there's other images or videos of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  her when she falls down and has to get back up. And, uh, I think the way she has to tilt her head [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=509.48s)]
*  to balance it is, I mean, really inspiring and heartbreaking at the exact same time. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=514.68s)]
*  Um, I saw on piker and his ilk, I don't know what that is, uh, called Israelis and Israeli [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=519.2399999999999s)]
*  government employees, retrogrades, termites, goblins, monsters, and anyone having any affiliation [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=526.12s)]
*  with the Israeli government should be taken out of society. How is that? Is it not like Tucker [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=531.64s)]
*  Carlson's instigating violent reaction and action against immigrants? Well, I mean, without, uh, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=537.0799999999999s)]
*  endorsing, uh, some of those, uh, names, um, I would question some, I don't even, uh, I don't [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=544.2s)]
*  even, uh, uh, swear that often on this program, but how is, uh, criticism of Israelis and Israeli [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  government employees in particular, um, uh, different from Tucker Carlson instigating [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=561.6400000000001s)]
*  violent reaction and action against immigrants? Well, one is there is no instigation of violence. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=568.36s)]
*  That's one difference. And then the other difference is, is that immigrants, um, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=575.4s)]
*  that is just a status. Uh, they are not in charge of anything other than them own selves. Uh, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=582.28s)]
*  if you are working for a government that is involved in a genocide, I mean, it's hard to [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=592.2s)]
*  say that you don't have culpability. I mean, I feel like as a taxpayer that I have culpability [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=597.8s)]
*  for what happened in Iraq. I have culpability for the weapons that are sent over to, uh, to, to bomb, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=604.92s)]
*  uh, you know, children, women, men in Gaza. I mean, we all have a certain amount of culpability. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=613.0s)]
*  It rises with the, with the proximity, uh, as proximity to power does. Exactly. And so, um, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=621.0s)]
*  that's one of the most obvious questions that I think someone could ask. Page one, that's page [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=627.88s)]
*  one as a Brit say, and I just, I really find the desire to pick apart, uh, Hassan's words like this [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=633.24s)]
*  when, as you said in that debate, you had like, we all engage in some level of hyperbole. It's just so, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=640.92s)]
*  um, you're trying to find something that isn't there. Also, half the things people put in Hassan's [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=647.0s)]
*  mouth were said by Felix Peterman. Hey folks, don't forget to hit the subscribe button and check out [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og2AJKQK7NA&t=651.72s)]
