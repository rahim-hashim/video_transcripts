# Chuck Schumer Sounds Like A Republican
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI)
*  The part that's just so striking to me is we've been having conversations about how [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden's foreign policy was so disastrous in part because he had this very archaic commitment [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  to the post-World War II system of alliances and not speaking to enemies, but building [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=17.32s)]
*  up NATO, building up AUKUS, and not necessarily being hawkish with China, not re-engaging [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=24.92s)]
*  in the Iran nuclear deal, which was Obama's arguably greatest foreign policy achievement [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=35.24s)]
*  during that time period. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=41.52s)]
*  You have Trump come in, right, and he's breaking down the traditional liberal foreign policy [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  orthodoxy, eschewing liberal interventionism and saying, you know, this is a failed strategy, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=49.36s)]
*  which he's right about, but then at the same time, it just feels like that is just about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=56.24s)]
*  enriching himself, right? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=61.8s)]
*  So I'm grateful to see this kind of change in this national security pattern and orthodoxy [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=63.28s)]
*  we've all been watching. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=74.4s)]
*  But if it's not paired with a policy of restraining Israel, then I guess is there a benefit just [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=77.36s)]
*  purely to breaking up this orthodoxy or this way of thinking? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  Because it just seems like Trump is mostly only interested in corruption here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think that's a very, very good point, but I can't really answer it in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=92.68s)]
*  a short form. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think Biden's foreign policy collapsed under the weight of what was going on in Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  I think he had levers and he had room to conduct liberal interventionism and continue to conduct [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=111.64s)]
*  that classic set of foreign policy, which failed in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  and Russia when I was in Russia in the 1990s. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=128.72s)]
*  That was a form of liberal interventionism completely collapsed to produce Putin. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=134.08s)]
*  But he still had the opportunity or the wheel room within that failed policy of applying [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=140.56s)]
*  a lot, lot more pressure on Netanyahu, principally by cutting off the arms and saying so. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=146.04s)]
*  But Netanyahu knew he never would. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  Netanyahu has got a very, very clear reading of what's going on in Capitol Hill. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=154.16000000000003s)]
*  And he's always had an iron grip on analysis of just how weak the Democrats are and how [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=161.36s)]
*  he can manipulate the Republicans. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=169.28s)]
*  And it could now be paradoxically that Trump, who's only interested in his pocket and where [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=173.52s)]
*  the next golf course is going and his next visit to the Queen and how much money he's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=179.84s)]
*  loading up in his personal coffers, complete corruption, could actually prove more of a [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=186.88s)]
*  problem to Netanyahu than Biden could because he only thinks in transactional terms about, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=192.88s)]
*  he doesn't think of good or evil, he doesn't care a damn about the Palestinians. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=201.44s)]
*  And his plan is to create a larger ethnic cleansing, three times larger, in fact, of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=205.28s)]
*  Palestinians than actually happened in 1948. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=213.76s)]
*  And considering that all of this conflict arises from that one single event in 1948, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=216.16s)]
*  how much more conflict are we storing up for ourselves generally? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=222.32s)]
*  Even if you smash Hamas, smash Hezbollah, even if the whole place goes quiet and the whole place [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=225.44s)]
*  falls under Israeli military control and everything's quiet, you're going to store up [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  a huge explosion in 10, 20 years down the line. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=239.52s)]
*  So it is so imperative now that we change our thinking about Israel, that Democrats [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=244.72s)]
*  change their thinking about Israel, that progressives change their thinking about Israel. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=251.68s)]
*  And it's so imperative, I think, that we have a clear-sighted view of actually [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  which country we're supporting. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=261.76s)]
*  When we say we're a friend of Israel, what sort of Israel? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=262.88s)]
*  Are we a friend of apartheid? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=265.12s)]
*  Are we a friend of genocide? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=266.8s)]
*  Are we a friend of ethnic cleansing? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=268.32s)]
*  Of course we're not. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=269.92s)]
*  And we've got to stop thinking of Israel in these sort of idealized terms of a country that is [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  genuinely good but is just being overtaken, it's just being seized by the wrong sort of people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=277.12s)]
*  It's not that anymore. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=283.44s)]
*  And there has to be a rethinking of the West's relationship with Israel. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=285.2s)]
*  Whatever happens to the Palestinians in Gaza, whatever happens to Hamas? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=291.44s)]
*  I hadn't planned on playing this for you, but you brought me here because when we're just speaking [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=297.76s)]
*  about how the Democrats need to kind of have a reckoning with liberal Zionism and with support [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=303.44s)]
*  for Israel, there is a fork in the road and you have even, it's not just members of the squad in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  the House or the more progressive members like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, Rashida [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=319.84s)]
*  Tlaib, some senators like Chris Van Hollen who you wouldn't have said is going to be an advocate [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=324.96s)]
*  for Palestinians, he's diverged from his own leader in the Senate who I like to call here Mr. 17% [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=332.4s)]
*  approval rating, Chuck Schumer. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  This is from a little while ago, but this is how he speaks about Israel. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  And you've done decades of reporting in the Middle East. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=346.48s)]
*  This is almost indistinguishable from how every Republican speaks about both the United Nations [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=350.72s)]
*  and international aid organizations. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=356.0s)]
*  This is under a minute, but I'd love your response here, David. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  So yes, it's very emotional and to almost all Jewish people, we all have relatives and we know [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=362.32s)]
*  about this has happened. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=369.52s)]
*  Again, genocide is a vicious, vicious word to use. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=371.44s)]
*  I will say it's a word that a UN special committee has used. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=377.04s)]
*  Please, the UN has been anti-Israel, anti-Semitically against Israel, double standard. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  Moynihan was my idol. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=389.04s)]
*  He became famous when in 1976 they tried to pass a resolution, Zionism is racism. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=390.32s)]
*  To say that the Jewish people should not have a state when every other people should have a state [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=397.36s)]
*  is anti-Semitism, the old double standard, ipso facto. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=403.36s)]
*  And the international organizations, I have no faith in them being fair. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=408.48s)]
*  These same international organizations, when horrible things go in in Darfur or China or [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=412.16s)]
*  wherever, they look the other way. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=416.8s)]
*  That's actually the opposite of the truth. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=420.56s)]
*  These international organizations and the United Nations are western in their construction, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=422.48s)]
*  by definition. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=428.0s)]
*  The criticism of the ICC, for example, has been that they basically will prosecute warlords or [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=430.0s)]
*  leaders in poorer countries that the United States has problems with and doesn't go after [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=436.8s)]
*  the people most aligned with the West when they commit human rights atrocities. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  But the ICC had no choice in the case of Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=449.52s)]
*  In response, the United States is sanctioning the International Criminal Court. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=454.56s)]
*  There's just your response to that, David, because it sounds like every Republican. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  This is a leading Democrat politician arguing against a rules-based world order. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=464.88s)]
*  There's a Democrat arguing against the ICC. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=474.48s)]
*  This is a Democrat arguing against the rule of law. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=478.16s)]
*  Would he have said the same thing about Putin, which the ICC sanctioned within months of the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=481.68s)]
*  attack on Ukraine? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=487.6s)]
*  This is unbelievable. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=490.0s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=492.8s)]
*  I'm not surprised by that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=495.36s)]
*  I've heard that clip before. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm not suddenly waking up to it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  But this is a really prima facie example of how that whole system of liberal Zionism is [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=501.04s)]
*  undermining itself. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=508.64000000000004s)]
*  He said many, many claims there, which were all very, very mixed up, all about Jews right to a [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=509.44s)]
*  homeland, all about which is Balfour. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=514.88s)]
*  We're not talking about Jewish right to a homeland. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=519.36s)]
*  We're talking about the Palestinian right to a homeland as well. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  We're not talking about the right of Jewish self-determination. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=524.56s)]
*  I come from a family of Jewish refugees from Vienna. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=529.6s)]
*  Half my family went to Haifa. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=533.68s)]
*  The other half didn't. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=535.84s)]
*  Some were Zionists. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=537.52s)]
*  Others weren't. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=538.56s)]
*  What has happened to all Jews, the suffering of all Jews, through what's happening in Israel, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=540.16s)]
*  is exactly what Israel does. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=547.52s)]
*  And as someone who is Jewish, I'm uniquely offended by that. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=549.36s)]
*  I have to stop frothing at the mouth almost because I know that's not the case. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=553.52s)]
*  I know it's not true. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=560.24s)]
*  I know that Israel does not stand for all Jews. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=562.0799999999999s)]
*  There is a big, big movement of American Jews saying, not in my name. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=566.56s)]
*  They are at the forefront of demonstrations against Gaza. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=574.8s)]
*  I think that is a positive thing. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=579.52s)]
*  I'm afraid Chuck Schumer has put himself into the dustbin of history. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=581.52s)]
*  He's put himself in many ways an honorable man on many other issues, but he's put himself [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=587.36s)]
*  on Israel literally on the wrong side. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=593.68s)]
*  He's justifying, whether you call it genocide, I'm not an international lawyer, but an awful [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=598.4s)]
*  lot of lawyers seem to think that that's a word that can only be used. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=604.8s)]
*  But we cannot have a situation, and we cannot tolerate a situation where one politician after [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=609.04s)]
*  another, one generation of politician after another, says those sorts of things. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=615.12s)]
*  And in so doing divides, a genocide occurred in Srebrenica, a genocide is occurring in Sudan, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  but it cannot happen by Israeli, at the hands of Israeli troops. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=628.96s)]
*  When there's the evidence that Gaza war is, unlike Vietnam, the most filmed and documented war ever. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=634.64s)]
*  And the evidence of that, even from the mouths of Israeli politicians, or even from [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=643.44s)]
*  even from the latest opposition figure, Yair Golan, accused Israel of having a hobby of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=650.32s)]
*  killing babies. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, if anyone else said that, you would call that anti-Semitic or blood libel. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=659.9200000000001s)]
*  This is an Israeli politician saying this. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=664.64s)]
*  So I think that clip shows you very, very clearly what has to change within the Democrat Party, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=666.48s)]
*  and to change for the side of fairness, for the side of decency, and also for the sake [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=673.44s)]
*  of Israelis, and also for the sake of Jews around the world, because that sort of performance [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=678.96s)]
*  has to stop. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=684.0s)]
*  Yep. I mean, you mentioned Vietnam. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=685.76s)]
*  Gaza's 141 square miles. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  You wrote this in your piece. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=691.6800000000001s)]
*  In the span of eight years, the US dropped more than five million tons of bombs in Vietnam, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=692.88s)]
*  making it the most bombed place on Earth. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=697.28s)]
*  By January of this year, Israel has dropped at least 100,000 tons of bombs on Gaza. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=699.36s)]
*  I just want to repeat that. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=708.32s)]
*  In the span of eight years, the US dropped five million tons of bombs on Vietnam, a much larger [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=709.68s)]
*  swath of territory than 140 odd square miles. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=715.84s)]
*  100,000 tons of bombs on Gaza. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=721.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=725.4399999999999s)]
*  And yeah, go ahead, David. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=725.68s)]
*  I mean, in terms of historical patterns, that is as a comparison of per square mile. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=728.0s)]
*  Per square mile, it works out at something like 18 times as many bombs. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  But in terms of historical bombings that have horrified the world since, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=737.28s)]
*  there's a massive amount of work done on the bombing of Dresden and the bombing of Hamburg. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=743.6s)]
*  And whether that was a war crime or not by the RAF and the firebombing that took place. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=750.72s)]
*  It turns out that if you compare the amount of bombs dropped on American bombs, generally [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=758.9599999999999s)]
*  dropped on Gaza, that is more than was dropped on Hamburg and Dresden and Coventry in the, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=765.84s)]
*  whatever it is, seven years of the World War II. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=777.12s)]
*  And that was within two or three months. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  So it was an immense, so, you know, we talk about Biden's weakness. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=783.92s)]
*  What actually happened was that Biden sanctioned this enormous dropping of American bombs. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=787.76s)]
*  This could not have been possible before. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=793.04s)]
*  And I don't make that claim sort of loosely or lightly. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=794.96s)]
*  There was an Israeli general, I forget now whom, who set an Air Force office who said, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=798.64s)]
*  had America not resupplied us with those 2000 pound bombs, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=803.76s)]
*  within two, we would have had to stop bombing Gaza within two months. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=808.8s)]
*  So there are two elements to this war. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=813.36s)]
*  One is the total nature of it triggered by the Hamas attack. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=815.04s)]
*  And the other is the length of time it has been permitted to go on. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=821.84s)]
*  I mean, Blair, Blair, Blair, but he was one of the leaders who stopped [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=825.28s)]
*  an early incursion into Gaza and just, you know, after 44 days and said, right, enough already. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=832.24s)]
*  That's it, finished. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=838.0s)]
*  But that hasn't happened. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=839.28s)]
*  And so Israel has behaved and Netanyahu has behaved in a way that is completely predictable [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=840.72s)]
*  with his alliances and with what he says. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=848.0s)]
*  What is, I couldn't have predicted in October, 2023 is how long the West, America, Britain, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=850.24s)]
*  France would have tolerated this. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=858.9599999999999s)]
*  Now they're coming to the end of it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=860.96s)]
*  But why has it taken so long and so many deaths to do so? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=862.72s)]
*  And to wrap up with you, David, you also write about how the despite [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=867.6800000000001s)]
*  kind of some lip service from Mohammed bin Salman and other leaders in the air, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=875.84s)]
*  in the neighboring countries, they're seeming they're doing these deals with Donald Trump, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=882.0s)]
*  these financial deals with him without really meaningful, meaningfully addressing Palestinian [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=889.12s)]
*  plight. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=895.6s)]
*  You know, there's like a political situation for these undemocratic leaders in the Middle East, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=896.0799999999999s)]
*  which, by the way, the United States props up because it's much more streamlined. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  If we can give military aid to these monarchs, essentially, then, you know, actually encouraging [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=905.92s)]
*  democracy in the Middle East, which is just it's just so crazy how opposite of the truth it is. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=914.8s)]
*  But what is the complicity of these leaders in the region who have basically publicly supported [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  Palestinians, but have privately been more than happy to kind of do deals both with Israel and [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=932.3199999999999s)]
*  the United States because that's where the money is. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=938.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think there are two things that one, they represent a new generation of autocrat. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=940.8s)]
*  Their fathers had the Palestinian issue, you know, stamped on their brow. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=945.68s)]
*  This generation has, you know, YouTube and, you know, TikTok stamped on their brow. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=950.56s)]
*  They're not interested. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  And they don't regard the Palestinian issue as remotely theirs. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=959.92s)]
*  They're interested in making money and they think that and, you know, they calculate that, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=965.9200000000001s)]
*  in fact, so-called normalization with Israel is the route to Washington's heart. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=975.12s)]
*  And so they use this strategy. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=981.12s)]
*  Mohammed bin Zayed, who's the president of the United Emirates, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=984.4s)]
*  introduced a young and unknown prince who was then called Mohammed bin Salman to the Trump [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=989.36s)]
*  clan, you know, before Trump's first term, basically through Israel. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=999.52s)]
*  And bin Salman visited Netanyahu several times secretly and courted pro-Israeli opinion [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1006.4s)]
*  in America by saying he personally didn't give a damn what happens to the Palestinians. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1019.36s)]
*  And that was very, very much the formula of the Abraham Accords, which was to sort of pave over [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1024.8799999999999s)]
*  cement over the Palestinian problem and use Palestinians as sort of gas starbiter, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1032.4s)]
*  you know, as foreign workers across the Arab world. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1038.72s)]
*  I mean, the tragedy of the Palestinian conflict has always been that Arab rulers have sold them [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1043.6000000000001s)]
*  down the river and they're doing the same thing now. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1050.0800000000002s)]
*  They managed to turn temporarily the U.S. policy on bombing Yemen. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1055.2s)]
*  That's a stop, which is a good thing. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1063.84s)]
*  And they turned and they persuaded Trump not to assassinate Ahmed Shahra, who's the new leader of [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1066.6399999999999s)]
*  Syria, that Israel definitely wants to depose and divide into three, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1074.96s)]
*  but to support him and remove sanctions, although whether the sanctions will actually be removed [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1079.2s)]
*  is a different matter. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1088.0800000000002s)]
*  It takes a long time to do that. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1088.96s)]
*  But not a word about Palestine. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1091.92s)]
*  And I think it's a day of shame for the Arab leaders because, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1096.0800000000002s)]
*  quite apart from anything else, forget humanity or forget moral principles. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1100.56s)]
*  If you have two million Palestinians floating around the space having been ejected from [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1106.08s)]
*  Palestine, they'll go anywhere and they will disrupt the stability of any of their, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1115.28s)]
*  you know, polite little rich states because they will be a force of destabilization. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1122.96s)]
*  And that is about the last thing these rulers want. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1131.36s)]
*  I mean, the real problem, one last comment, the real problem about normalization [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1134.48s)]
*  is this is a deal, as you said, between a deeply dubious Israeli leadership, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1139.2s)]
*  or ideologically motivated right-wing Israeli leadership that wants to recreate the borders [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1146.96s)]
*  of greater Israel and people with almost no legitimacy, people who are rulers simply because [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1152.4s)]
*  they are the sons of other rulers. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1161.76s)]
*  And what they fear through normalizing with Israel is a revolt of their own population because, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1165.44s)]
*  and Mohammed bin Salman has actually admitted this, he said, I couldn't sign a normalization [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1173.28s)]
*  deal with Israel, otherwise I might meet the same fate as Anwar Sadat who was shot. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1178.48s)]
*  And it's true. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1186.56s)]
*  And you would meet the same fate. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1187.68s)]
*  That's true. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1188.72s)]
*  Right. But then that's, but that's what you're, the conclusion of what you're saying is, is that [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1190.1000000000001s)]
*  if Israel is only accepting an ethnic cleansing plan for the Palestinians [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1196.26s)]
*  and these Arab rulers are doing this secretly because they're fearful of the backlash with [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1202.66s)]
*  their population, but they don't want to take on millions of Palestinian refugees to absorb them [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1209.3s)]
*  into their country, that it feels like a handshake agreement for genocide then. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1215.94s)]
*  Yes, it is. It is. And the only thing stopping genocide, or the major thing stopping genocide, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1220.74s)]
*  is the determination of Palestinians. And I've met who say, I would rather die on my land than [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1225.78s)]
*  leave. And if you go around the West Bank, where they're being ejected from their farms on hillsides [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1232.9s)]
*  in South Hebron, and they're not Hamas, they haven't got a gun there, and they're facing [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1239.8600000000001s)]
*  armed settlers, that's what they say. That's what they do. They die on their land rather than, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1244.74s)]
*  rather than leave. And I think Gaza will do the same thing. I'm surprised that Gaza has held out [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1249.54s)]
*  for as long as it has. I'm surprised there aren't more anti-Hamas demonstrations taking place. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1255.38s)]
*  I'm really surprised that this has gone on because this is like being starved into submission. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1260.74s)]
*  But we're under a big, big illusion if we think we've got rid of resistance groups by [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1267.54s)]
*  doing this. I think you've just handed the torch to an even more violent generation. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1275.6200000000001s)]
*  Fatah will not benefit, or the Palestinian Authority will not benefit [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1283.3s)]
*  if Hamas is crushed. Quite the reverse. Well, David, I really appreciate your time today. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1288.1s)]
*  Sorry for being so gloomy. I mean... No, I mean, but overall it is so much suffering, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1295.46s)]
*  but in terms of the overarching theme of your piece, they're winning these battles. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1302.74s)]
*  They will win every battle. Palestine doesn't have an air force, doesn't have an airport. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1310.42s)]
*  A lack of symmetry here. They control the borders of the area that they're bombing. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1316.74s)]
*  There's no way for this to be an equivalent military conflict, and yet overall, because of [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1322.82s)]
*  the barbarity, I think you're right in the overarching view of Israel's loss here. David, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1330.1s)]
*  thanks so much for your time today. Middle East Eye does wonderful work. Everybody should check [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1338.4199999999998s)]
*  it out. Thanks so much for your time today. Really appreciate it. Thanks, Emma. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1342.02s)]
*  you [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z55_c7sLQwI&t=1360.1s)]
