# Biden/Harris' Gaza Message Failure: A Gift to Trump
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc)
*  I don't know if it's worth our while spending too too much time trying to bring people back to reality. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=0.0s)]
*  I like that. I think it's a good thing for you to do with your friends and with your family. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=8.0s)]
*  And you know, maybe you'll have a 10% success rate. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=15.0s)]
*  But as a political matter, what we need to do is make sure that those 20 million people who didn't go out to vote, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=20.0s)]
*  vote next time around and make sure that that number is bigger. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=32.0s)]
*  And make sure that the people who, you know, voted for Trump, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=36.0s)]
*  but don't necessarily subscribe to a completely different world reality, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=42.0s)]
*  also next time have reason to vote for the person running against them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=47.0s)]
*  And then you have to stand. That means you have to create an alternative alternative vision and advocate what you stand for. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=52.0s)]
*  Like, you know, it was the Biden leadership vacuum in many ways, the lack of communication, the incongruity of it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=62.0s)]
*  And then, of course, the the Gaza genocide were like, that's a good example of with where Kamala Harris's failure to distance herself from Biden in those days. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=69.0s)]
*  Who knows if that would have made a difference, but I definitely think it would have benefited her at the very least, would have been closer. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=81.0s)]
*  You see how like we can say until we're blue in the face and we did, at least I did, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=89.0s)]
*  like Phil Gordon better than the neocons that Trump's going to bring in. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=95.0s)]
*  Trump's getting 100 million from Maryam Adelson, Kamala Harris. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=99.0s)]
*  She would have been better. She wouldn't have said that we're going to just seize control of Gaza and we're going to build hotel casinos on it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=103.0s)]
*  Like, I think we can be factual about that. That wouldn't have happened. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=112.0s)]
*  But we can say that a million times over. Everybody that's paying attention to this show is already highly engaged. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=115.0s)]
*  It's not on like we could have screamed this every day until we were blue in the face and it wouldn't have made a difference because it's on the Democrats to draw a contrast. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=122.0s)]
*  And the fact that they were unwilling to break from the Israel lobby is why they couldn't draw that contrast. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=130.0s)]
*  And it falls on them. It falls on them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=137.0s)]
*  They chose arming a genocide over winning an election. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=140.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's just what happened. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=142.0s)]
*  And that's what history will show. And all the people saying, you know, what about this, about Dearborn voters? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=144.0s)]
*  Those people are actually don't be defensive about those people, dogpile them because they're the ones that should be chased out of the party. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=148.0s)]
*  And you can just you can wish and try to like wish into existence that millions of people paid attention to the nuances that I describe. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=154.0s)]
*  But you know, what's a more expedient way to change the world is not to shame those folks, but to demand more of the Democrats. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=165.0s)]
*  I mean, I mean, I'm sorry. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=174.0s)]
*  Personnel promises for income in this administration when you're banning Palestinians from speaking at your convention is just never going to be even close. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=179.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's the problem is that, you know, if there was going to be and certainly look, yeah, I think our we were very consistent. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=188.0s)]
*  And said, you know, that at the very least, there's a one percent chance that Harris is going to be better for the Palestinian people than Donald Trump. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=196.0s)]
*  That would be sufficient in that argument. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=207.0s)]
*  But it is very hard to make that argument when you are outwardly showing every you know, when you're sending Richie Torres to Michigan, you're sending Bill Clinton to Michigan for people to believe that argument. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=210.0s)]
*  I mean, I happen to believe that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=222.0s)]
*  But and even I was like, what the F are they doing? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=224.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=231.0s)]
*  And so it's it's I mean, the level of engagement with news that would require people to understand that is so unrealistic and frankly, like not even that clear because the actions of the administration were not demonstrating it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=232.0s)]
*  And it's like that, frankly, you know, it falls on Harris for not distancing herself from Biden. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=248.0s)]
*  But this was this is Biden. I mean, this was his ideology of Zionism and his decades in the Senate, like leadership on this front. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=253.0s)]
*  He's believed in this consistently his whole career and his brain wasn't working and he just let the let the West exec crew and and and Hoxdean and McGurk and all those folks just run the show. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=263.0s)]
*  And we saw what happened. So Stephen Alaska says, so is Trump worse? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=275.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, look, technically right now, I don't know if you can say I don't know if you can say that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=280.0s)]
*  I mean, I know that the the amount of of Palestinians in Gaza are dying, dying today is less than it was than it was during the Biden administration. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=285.0s)]
*  Some USA is getting through to him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=297.0s)]
*  I'm finally do I think that ultimately Trump is going to be worse than Harris? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=298.0s)]
*  You know, Harris was also a hypothetical. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=305.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I will say all we were going to negative prognosis of what I think she would have done. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=309.0s)]
*  But Obama stood up to to to Netanyahu with the Iran deal. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=313.0s)]
*  Like, it's possible that Democrats would do it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=317.0s)]
*  It's not possible. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=319.0s)]
*  Again, like I agree, but I just want to say, like, I think even I was saying it was worth voting for Harris over Trump, even if you said a null difference, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=321.0s)]
*  because I think that's the frankly the safest thing to credibly promise, because I don't I don't I wouldn't predict any backbone from Harris on this. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=330.0s)]
*  I don't even know if that she would have secured the ceasefire. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=338.0s)]
*  But who knows? But the ceasefire theoretically would have would have would have started before that she got it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=340.0s)]
*  But the ceasefire started and there's a massacre in Janine right now. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=346.0s)]
*  I mean, we're not talking much about that, but like Trump has greenlit the West Bank and they've now likely is going to greenlit some annexation of the West Bank. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=349.0s)]
*  And there's slaughter all over the place right now. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=358.0s)]
*  They've killed at least like dozens of people since since the ceasefire started. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=360.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not convinced that his whole thing is just to sort of like make that the story. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=364.0s)]
*  Well, Netanyahu is here so he doesn't have to deal with any any of the actual realities on the ground. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=368.0s)]
*  But yeah, Charlie jerk, Jimmy Dord days after saying he no longer supports Medicare for all is saying Trump is actually playing some 4D chess against Netanyahu. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=373.0s)]
*  And has he completely explicitly say that? Yeah, like the quote. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=384.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, because he was the funny thing. I did catch something like some argument. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=389.0s)]
*  I don't know if I was on Twitter aware about why he was supporting RFK because he's like, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=393.0s)]
*  I don't care about his position on Israel because he's going to be head of the Health and Human Services. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=398.0s)]
*  And I just remember in the back of my head, I didn't spend much time. I think I like. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=404.0s)]
*  Well, what about his everybody loves their private health insurance? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=407.0s)]
*  I mean, he's the head of Health and Human Services. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=411.0s)]
*  Like, what do you care about? Oh, just the vaccination attention, which is what you know, why the force the vote thing was a big, big, big lie. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=414.0s)]
*  And anyone who subscribed to that or is still like harping on that is a big idiot. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=422.0s)]
*  And did you hear about corruption and like billionaires being involved in our government? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=426.0s)]
*  It's so odd that his voice and like those folks don't have anything to like this. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=430.0s)]
*  Elon Musk had a special dispensation for the billionaire corruption thing because he's so public. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=435.0s)]
*  Jimmy had David Sacks on to support the Silicon Valley Bank bailout. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=440.0s)]
*  Yeah, like he's he's bought by venture capitalists. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=445.0s)]
*  Scott from Detroit. It shouldn't be Sam's job to make the argument that Harris would be one percent better on Gaza. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=449.0s)]
*  The Harris campaign was unwilling to directly say, we'll be one percent better on Gaza. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=454.0s)]
*  Well, that's what I'm saying. It falls on them, the people that are blaming the voters on this. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=459.0s)]
*  I mean, come on, like it's the same people right now. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=464.0s)]
*  And I don't want to be too online about it. So it's a throwaway comment. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=469.0s)]
*  But the same people that are saying like dunking on the Dearborn voters were not we're saying that the Gaza thing was a nonissue during the election. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=471.0s)]
*  So you have no credibility. Sorry. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=480.0s)]
*  It's a guilty conscience. They know that that all their actions saying all these people don't matter, f them, blew the election. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=483.0s)]
*  That's why we're here right now. I mean, I blame a lot of like corporate and finance stuff in the years preceding. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=490.0s)]
*  But acutely 2024, it's because Dem supported Israel over winning the election. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=496.0s)]
*  All right. So Charlie Jerk says he explicitly said he wants some kind of insurance for all. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=501.0s)]
*  Universal health. Yes, that's the classic care. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=506.0s)]
*  But he wants private for providers and private doctors, no socialized medicine. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=510.0s)]
*  Oh, so ACA expansion. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=514.0s)]
*  Exactly. For Medicare for all said, I don't trust the government to do health care because they're libertarians. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=516.0s)]
*  I mean, it is a bunch of cranks. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=522.0s)]
*  Folks, we got to go. That is our show for today. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=524.0s)]
*  We will be back tomorrow. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=527.0s)]
*  I'll be here on Friday and hopefully I'll have my hiccups and my voice fixed. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=529.0s)]
*  I need AI to remove your hiccups. Bye bye. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=536.0s)]
*  You [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0sewjxUJBc&t=557.0s)]
