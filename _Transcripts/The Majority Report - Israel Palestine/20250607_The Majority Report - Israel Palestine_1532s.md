# Jeremy Scahill On Why He Talked To Hamas
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4)
*  I guess it was about a week or two ago, published an interview you had with Usef Hamdan, one [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=0.0s)]
*  of Hamas' leaders. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=7.24s)]
*  It is a stunning thing, I have to just say right up front, I want to ask you what your [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=10.08s)]
*  idea was behind it, but it is stunning for Americans, for English speakers, to be able [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=14.3s)]
*  to watch something like this because it is so rare that we, who are following what's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=20.48s)]
*  happening with the assault and genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza, to hear directly [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=28.66s)]
*  from any Hamas, never mind spokesperson, but leader in such a fashion. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=36.9s)]
*  Starting around October 8th, it was almost impossible as an American not to know the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=47.42s)]
*  names of about a half a dozen Israeli spokespeople. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=54.36s)]
*  At that time in particular, there's not a single Palestinian, never mind someone from [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=60.92s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=67.4s)]
*  Tell us what your thinking is as a journalist in covering this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=70.64s)]
*  I think it's somewhat obvious, but reiterate that for us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=74.36s)]
*  One way of thinking about it, Sam, is that much of Western media coverage of wars in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  general is both literally and psychologically embedded journalism. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=86.76s)]
*  You're often embedded with the forces of the occupier or the invading force, whether it's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=93.84s)]
*  the United States or Israel, and this is a very common dynamic. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=99.28s)]
*  But also there's a psychological embedding that takes place where journalists often prioritize [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  overwhelmingly the narrative of whether it's the United States or Israel. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=109.64s)]
*  This is journalistic malpractice not to go to the other side of the barrel of the gun [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=115.0s)]
*  that is pointed at other nations or people around the world and say, let's actually talk [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=120.24s)]
*  to those people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=125.4s)]
*  Let's understand their perspective. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=127.12s)]
*  Throughout my 25 years in journalism, a lot of what I've done is gone to countries where [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=130.2s)]
*  the United States is engaged in a military action or a war and talk to the people living [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=134.76s)]
*  under the bombs. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=139.92s)]
*  And that often includes then talking to people like Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=141.56s)]
*  Yemen or the Taliban in Afghanistan or al-Shabaab in Somalia. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=146.44s)]
*  And I've done all of that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  In this particular war against the Palestinians of Gaza, the Israelis have prevented any international [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  journalists from entering Gaza. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=159.6s)]
*  And so the only responsible journalistic practice in my view to try to counter or to counterbalance [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=162.12s)]
*  the propaganda coming from the U.S. and Israeli side is to work with Palestinian journalists [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  on the ground in Gaza so you can get actual reporting from the ground, not just opinions, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=175.74s)]
*  but also talk to the officials from the organization that the United States and Israel have compared [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=180.96s)]
*  to the Nazis, have said are terrorists in the vein of ISIS and al-Qaeda, and to fact [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=186.48s)]
*  check the allegations of the powerful, but also understand what is their motivation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  And when you do that and when you give a space for people to actually hear their perspective, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=197.0s)]
*  then you understand that there's a lot more nuance to the story than you've been shown. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=204.88s)]
*  And I'll say that as someone who's also monitoring media coverage, it's not that officials from [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=211.24s)]
*  Hamas, including Osama Hamdan, who I interviewed, are never on Western media. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=216.84s)]
*  CNN has people from Hamas on occasionally. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=222.36s)]
*  The New York Times interviews people from Hamas occasionally. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=224.8s)]
*  But often what happens is it's just a relitigation of the events of October 7th where the same [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  exact questions are asked over and over and over again. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  And so what I wanted to do was say, let's treat our audience as smart people and let's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=236.98s)]
*  sit down and have an in-depth, in this particular case it was a 90-minute conversation in English [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=242.85999999999999s)]
*  with a leader of Hamas who's been in the organization since its very early stages. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=250.17999999999998s)]
*  He became a member of Hamas in 1992. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  He's a chemist by training and he's served as Hamas's chief in Lebanon, in Iran, and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=258.52s)]
*  as the head of its international relations division. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=264.5s)]
*  And he was one of two senior Hamas officials that met directly with Adam Boller in those [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=266.72s)]
*  direct talks that took place and was involved with the recent deal that resulted in the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=271.62s)]
*  release of Edon Alexander, an American citizen who served in the Israeli army and was taken [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=275.6s)]
*  prisoner by Palestinian fighters on October 7th while in an Israeli military uniform as [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=281.36s)]
*  an active duty soldier. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  I want to get to his release in a moment, but let's go back, and I guess more broadly, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=289.58000000000004s)]
*  how did you find him? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=302.06s)]
*  Because like you say, the perspective that we have on Hamas in this country is they're [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=304.82000000000005s)]
*  designated a terrorist group by the United States. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  All its leaders are on the terrorist watch thing and we are just told that it's impossible [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=318.62s)]
*  to have conversations. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=323.98s)]
*  There's no, they want the death of Palestinians, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=325.46000000000004s)]
*  What was your perspective? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=330.98s)]
*  You know, when we launched Dropsite News in July of 2024, we're coming up on one year [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=333.70000000000005s)]
*  of publishing at Dropsite, the first stories that we did were a series of stories where [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=339.12s)]
*  I interviewed officials from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=343.34s)]
*  You know, I've been working as a journalist in the Middle East for much of my adult life [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=348.5s)]
*  and have contacts. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=353.38s)]
*  And so, you know, the act of like, how do you get in touch with them was not necessarily [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=355.85999999999996s)]
*  the most difficult part of this. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=360.94s)]
*  But we're operating in an environment where Donald Trump is clearly trying to expand the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=364.4s)]
*  laws on what constitutes material support for terrorism, is going after nonprofit news [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=370.5s)]
*  organizations. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  And so when you try to do your job as a journalist and it involves talking to people who are [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=377.78000000000003s)]
*  designated by the U.S. State Department as terrorists, and I've interviewed multiple [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=383.14000000000004s)]
*  people who are State Department designated, you know, then you really are committing an [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=386.5s)]
*  act of journalism that this White House does not want you to engage in, which is ironic, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=392.18s)]
*  given that they're engaged in direct talks with literally with the very people that I [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=397.5s)]
*  was speaking with. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=402.65999999999997s)]
*  But, you know, I think that to put it in a broader historical context, Palestinians have [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=403.65999999999997s)]
*  been so broadly dehumanized and the Palestine exception is so ferocious. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=409.34s)]
*  And the portrayal of Hamas, we can have a discussion about what are Hamas's politics, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=416.53999999999996s)]
*  both locally in Gaza and, you know, their broader view of the world. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=421.02s)]
*  But to compare Hamas to ISIS or Hamas to al-Qaeda is such a fallacy and a lie that it is risible, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=425.52s)]
*  that it is utterly ridiculous. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=434.12s)]
*  Hamas has never conducted an operation outside of the borders of historic Palestine, of what [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=436.52s)]
*  it considers to be the territory that it is fighting to liberate. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=442.4s)]
*  It's not going and blowing up aircraft. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  It's not attacking U.S. embassies abroad. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=448.46s)]
*  In fact, I've had multiple Hamas officials say to me, we have no problem whatsoever with [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=451.0s)]
*  the United States outside of the context of its support for an apartheid colonial regime [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=456.14s)]
*  that is seeking to just permanently occupy us. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=460.56s)]
*  So we should have an honest and open discussion about Hamas, but let's get the historical [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=463.62s)]
*  facts right. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=468.28s)]
*  Let's set Palestinian armed resistance in a proper context. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=469.28s)]
*  So I don't even bother to take on the lies or the propaganda that is thrown at anyone [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=472.94s)]
*  who dares to speak with them, because I think that you're then playing their game. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=479.5s)]
*  Our readers, the viewers of the show, are smart enough, have independent enough minds [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=483.8s)]
*  where you can provide them with an opportunity to hear a voice and they make their own assessment [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=488.88s)]
*  of what they think of what that person is saying. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=493.64s)]
*  And can you expand a little bit on that history of Hamas and how they differ from those other [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=496.22s)]
*  groups that you mentioned? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=502.5s)]
*  Because frankly, that flattening is just Islamophobia that a lot of the Western press relies on [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=503.7s)]
*  because in part, there's no Western journalists in Gaza. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=509.34s)]
*  Israel has blocked it and they're killing at a record pace the journalists that are [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=514.02s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=518.06s)]
*  And they're basically saying that they're associated with Hamas, so you can't trust [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=520.3399999999999s)]
*  them. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=524.06s)]
*  It's a way to block out, I think, all information until they can continue the genocide. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=525.22s)]
*  But there's this overall flattening of Hamas's role in Gaza, where they are in part a governmental [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=532.7s)]
*  organization. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=540.3000000000001s)]
*  They were, of course, involved in the October 7th attacks and orchestrated them. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=541.3000000000001s)]
*  But what is their role in or what has been their role in society in Gaza? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=547.62s)]
*  And how do those differentiations look? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=554.58s)]
*  To back up a little bit before, a large segment of the Palestinian armed resistance prior [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=557.62s)]
*  to the 1980s was sort of secular and left-wing in orientation. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=563.74s)]
*  And some of the groups that form the core of the Palestine Liberation Organization or [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=571.38s)]
*  Palestinian resistance in the 60s and 70s are still very active, and some of them as [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=575.86s)]
*  second tier or second wave participants also engaged in the October 7th operations that [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=582.14s)]
*  are known in Arabic as Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=589.18s)]
*  And Hamas grew out of a transitional period where the Israelis really used extreme force [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=593.8199999999999s)]
*  against the Palestinian resistance in historic Palestine, exiled many of the leaders and [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=600.1s)]
*  activists who were part of these organizations to Lebanon and elsewhere, and in exiling them, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=605.78s)]
*  they had Palestinians in camps along with Lebanese resistance fighters, Iranian resistance [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=613.02s)]
*  fighters. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=618.66s)]
*  You had the Muslim Brotherhood rising up in Egypt against the secular government in Cairo. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=619.66s)]
*  And you had these very heady times in the late 1970s, early 1980s, and then stretching [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=626.42s)]
*  to the mid 1980s where all these ideas were swirling around among Palestinians of different [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=632.54s)]
*  factions. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=638.1s)]
*  And you started to have a real discussion of what is the relationship between Islam [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=639.1s)]
*  as a religion and the politics of Palestinian liberation. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=643.26s)]
*  And out of that discourse rose groups like Hamas, which originally was sort of an offshoot [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=646.86s)]
*  of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, but later became its own standalone entity quite quickly. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=652.72s)]
*  And you had Palestinian Islamic Jihad as well. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=657.8000000000001s)]
*  And so Hamas formed as an Islamic resistance movement that was combining Islamic principles [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=661.18s)]
*  with the traditional politics of Palestinian resistance. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=668.74s)]
*  And it was very controversial in the 2006 elections in Palestine among Islamic resistance [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=671.66s)]
*  forces that Hamas decided to stand for the elections. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=677.8199999999999s)]
*  And the leader of the party at the time was Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated last [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=682.26s)]
*  summer in Tehran, Iran by Israel when he went to attend the inauguration of the new [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=688.1s)]
*  Iranian president. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=694.3000000000001s)]
*  Israel assassinated him. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=695.86s)]
*  He was also the chief negotiator for the Palestinian side. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=696.86s)]
*  So Hamas wins the elections. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=700.1s)]
*  They defeat the preferred U.S. candidates, not just in Gaza, but in all Palestinian territories. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=702.26s)]
*  So Ismail Haniyeh from Hamas, the Islamic resistance movement, was supposed to be, according [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=708.6800000000001s)]
*  to the democratic process, the prime minister of Palestine. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=713.94s)]
*  Well, the United States and Israel, of course, went nuts about this. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=717.82s)]
*  The U.S. and other Western countries say we have to impose sanctions. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=721.6600000000001s)]
*  The wrong people won the free and fair election. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=724.6600000000001s)]
*  So Israel then imposes a blockade. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=727.5s)]
*  And Hamas has a civil war in 2007 with Fatah, the party of Mahmoud Abbas, the 89-year-old [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=730.36s)]
*  head of the Palestinian Authority, whose popularity in Palestine is lower than Sam's, as who people [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=738.0200000000001s)]
*  want to be in charge of Palestine. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=743.92s)]
*  Sorry, Sam. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=745.76s)]
*  Fair. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=746.76s)]
*  Very fair. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=747.76s)]
*  There was a civil war. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=748.76s)]
*  And essentially what happened is that Mahmoud Abbas consolidated his control of the occupied [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=750.5999999999999s)]
*  West Bank and Fatah was the dominant political force there. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=757.4799999999999s)]
*  And then Hamas becomes the government and dominant political force of Gaza, even though [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=760.68s)]
*  roughly 50% of people in Gaza did not vote for Hamas. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  This is an important fact to remember. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=769.7199999999999s)]
*  If you look, I've read opinion polls over the years. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=771.42s)]
*  As a government, people had the same gripes about Hamas that people in New York have about [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=773.78s)]
*  trash collection or humans anywhere. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=779.4399999999999s)]
*  We always have to remember this because it's never allowed. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=781.64s)]
*  Palestinians have the same issues we have about their government. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=784.38s)]
*  Not everything is, oh, my God, do we want Hamas to be attacking Israel? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=786.76s)]
*  Do we believe in armed resistance? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=790.42s)]
*  Basic things, are we paid on time? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=792.34s)]
*  Are people picking up the trash? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=794.02s)]
*  Are our schools okay? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=795.6s)]
*  So those kind of governance issues, Hamas has had to deal with since 2006. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=796.76s)]
*  And because there have been no other elections allowed, Hamas has now just been the government [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=801.0s)]
*  for all this time without ever having to go to the ballot box again. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=805.8s)]
*  And Israel is constantly bombing, tightening the siege in the lead up to October 7th. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=810.04s)]
*  And from my conversations with people from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, they're watching [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=816.84s)]
*  a number of factors. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=821.26s)]
*  They're watching the Saudis get closer to normalizing relations with Israel. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=822.54s)]
*  They watched what happened under the first Trump administration. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=826.36s)]
*  Israel was tightening the blockade even further. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=829.56s)]
*  You had increased attacks against al-Aqsa Mosque, one of the holiest sites in Islam [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=831.88s)]
*  and the holiest site of Islam in historic Palestine. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=836.56s)]
*  And you also had a lot of pressure internally in Gaza that the status quo was getting worse [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=841.26s)]
*  and worse, that things were crumbling. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=846.04s)]
*  People were irritated with Hamas as a government. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=848.5s)]
*  So all of these factors and a sense that there had to be a calling of the question on Israel [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=850.88s)]
*  or else the Palestinians would be subjected to a slow death, led to the decision to launch [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=856.04s)]
*  the October 7th attacks. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=862.76s)]
*  And so now we have a situation where Israel had a well-oiled propaganda machine. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=864.56s)]
*  They come out of the gates and they're saying Hamas is Daesh, Hamas is ISIS, Hamas is al-Qaeda, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  Hamas is representing a threat to the entire world. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=875.92s)]
*  And the narrative was completely riddled with outright falsehoods and lies to manufacture [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=879.0999999999999s)]
*  the consent for what would become the zenith moment of Netanyahu's career, which was always [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=884.32s)]
*  about the annihilation of the Palestinians as a people and the removal of them from their land. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=890.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=896.04s)]
*  I just want to fill in a couple of things because I think the misunderstanding as to [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=897.04s)]
*  what Hamas is, aside from how they've been designated by the United States as a terrorist [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=901.16s)]
*  organization, like you say, they've been in the business of trash collection, of governance. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=912.7199999999999s)]
*  So I mean, there is a much broader portfolio they have than just being an armed militancy. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=921.8s)]
*  I should also say that my understanding, and I wonder, I don't know how much of this you [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=930.8s)]
*  have gotten into in these conversations, but I imagine over the years that the Muslim [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=940.28s)]
*  Brotherhood's perspective was essentially as a Reader's Digest version, that you start [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=944.88s)]
*  with a certain piousness as a Muslim and that will bring about liberation for the Palestinian [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=952.36s)]
*  people. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=961.0s)]
*  Hamas inverted that and said, we first must liberate the Palestinian people and then we [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=962.0s)]
*  will be able to attain a certain level of piousness within the context of Islam. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=970.44s)]
*  And following the elections, and the elections, if I remember correctly, and I think you and [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=978.16s)]
*  I were probably having conversations about Iraq at the time, was a unilateral decision [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=984.4s)]
*  by the Israelis and to some extent with encouragement from the Bush administration because they [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=992.8s)]
*  thought that it would disempower Hamas. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=998.92s)]
*  And the absolute wrong thing happened because the whole development of Hamas was helped [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1003.0799999999999s)]
*  by the Israelis to create a conflict within the Palestinian society so that there was [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1010.04s)]
*  no single voice in which they had to negotiate with, so that they could argue, we have no [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1016.48s)]
*  partner for peace because the Palestinian people can't even get on the same page. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1023.5999999999999s)]
*  And that was why we saw the rise of Fatah at that moment because Israel sort of pumped [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1028.84s)]
*  the brakes and then sort of did a fallback position. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1037.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot to unpack there. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1041.36s)]
*  I mean, first, you're correct that we have to remember and it's so crazy that this is [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1044.32s)]
*  true, but Hamas is often spoken about as though they're foreigners that came into Gaza, as [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1050.9199999999998s)]
*  though the organization itself in all of its layers is not comprised of people that grew [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1056.0s)]
*  up in the concentration camp of Gaza themselves, whose families were expelled during the Nakba [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1063.6s)]
*  beginning in 1948, or that Palestinians view them as somehow separate from the fabric of [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1069.04s)]
*  Palestinian life or discourse. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1074.44s)]
*  And, you know, Hamas primarily views itself as a national liberation movement. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1076.3999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't primarily view, it doesn't view itself as we're going to establish the caliphate. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1082.24s)]
*  You know, Hamas is an Islamic resistance movement and the emphasis is on the word resistance. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1086.8799999999999s)]
*  And while everyone uses the word Hamas, like it's Kleenex, to describe every single group, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1091.8799999999999s)]
*  there were more than half a dozen armed factions that participated in one way or another in [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1098.2s)]
*  the October 7th attacks. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1104.44s)]
*  And some of them are Christian in their religious confession. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1106.2s)]
*  Some are Muslims, some are secular, some are religious. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1110.36s)]
*  You know, Hamas also has the Al Qassam Brigades, which is its armed wing. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1114.2s)]
*  And while there is influence from the political leadership of Hamas, and so far when the political [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1119.0s)]
*  leadership has signed a ceasefire or a truce deal, Al Qassam Brigades have respected that. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1125.0s)]
*  But there is autonomy. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1130.3600000000001s)]
*  There is quite a bit of evidence to suggest that most of Hamas's political leadership, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1131.72s)]
*  with the exception of Yahya Senuar, the late political head of Hamas, who is widely believed [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1136.04s)]
*  to be the kind of intellectual mastermind of October 7th, that very few of the members [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1142.44s)]
*  of the political leadership of Hamas knew in advance that this was going to happen or [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1149.0s)]
*  when it was going to happen. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1153.0800000000002s)]
*  I bring that up because the U.S. narrative is so often filled with oversimplifications [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1154.52s)]
*  or inaccuracies, not to mention the Israeli narrative, which is outright propaganda and [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1161.3200000000002s)]
*  total lies. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1165.0800000000002s)]
*  But the U.S. portrayal of Hamas as akin to ISIS is so far from the truth. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1166.2s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is that armed resistance and the right to armed resistance remains [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1171.96s)]
*  one of the single highest policy positions among all Palestinians, not just in Gaza, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1176.3600000000001s)]
*  but throughout the West Bank and those that live in what's called 48 territory, Palestinians [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1182.2s)]
*  who live within what currently constitutes the state of Israel. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1187.0800000000002s)]
*  Can you speak a little bit more about that armed resistance and how the Abraham Accords, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1191.16s)]
*  crossing over from the Trump administration to being continued under the Biden administration, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1197.88s)]
*  affected Hamas's decision to stage the October 7th attacks? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1203.88s)]
*  And if you could even put that even into further context into what their armed resistance is even [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1208.44s)]
*  capable of when you compare it to say the Israelis, there's no Air Force, their military [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1214.12s)]
*  capabilities are limited by design because of Israel's blockade. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1221.3999999999999s)]
*  But why Saudi normalization would be such a threat to them because of that complete [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1227.6399999999999s)]
*  gap in firepower basically with the Israelis? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1236.04s)]
*  No, very, I mean, good questions. And I should say, you know, while I have interviewed many [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1242.3600000000001s)]
*  Hamas officials about the question that you're asking me, I don't feel like I have a clear [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1247.64s)]
*  enough sense of what the actual truth is. I can share with you vignettes or things that I've heard, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1254.2s)]
*  but I want to make clear I'm not here offering the definitive history of Hamas's perspective [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1260.3600000000001s)]
*  or motivations for October 7th. But having said that, I'll share with you some of what I do [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1265.8s)]
*  understand. I think the issue of Saudi Arabia was this, that you had all of these, let's say lesser [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1269.48s)]
*  important countries to the geopolitical situation between Israel and Palestine that had normalized, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1275.96s)]
*  that were not considered to be a huge problem for the Palestinians because it didn't really carry [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1282.84s)]
*  much weight. In the case of Saudi Arabia, this would be by far the most powerful economically [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1289.16s)]
*  and otherwise nation, Arab nation, to normalize with Israel since the decades ago when Egypt and [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1296.2s)]
*  Jordan both entered into their peace agreements with Israel. So if the Saudis were to normalize [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1303.4s)]
*  with Israel and to not insist that a Palestinian state be part of the deal, this would have been [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1310.76s)]
*  the most significant blow to the Palestinian cause delivered by the decisions of an Arab ruler in [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1317.56s)]
*  many, many decades. And I don't think we can understate how significant that would have been [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1322.92s)]
*  because the Saudis understand that both Israel and the United States desperately want Saudi Arabia [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1328.3600000000001s)]
*  to normalize with Israel. So if the Saudis were to take that off the table, then you would essentially [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1334.92s)]
*  have an entirely incapacitated Arab, broader Arab nation with no ability whatsoever to influence [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1341.72s)]
*  the position of the United States, not to mention Israel. So I think in a nutshell, that's what I [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1350.6s)]
*  think was the issue there. It was more of a high-level political analysis. On the issue of the [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1355.0s)]
*  weapons though, Emma, let's remember that most of the weapons that Al Qassam brigades have [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1361.32s)]
*  and that Islamic Jihad have on the ground in Gaza are domestically manufactured by engineering [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1368.36s)]
*  corps that have been doing this for decades. They're manufacturing their own bullets. They're [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1376.76s)]
*  manufacturing their own sniper rifles. They're manufacturing their own rockets. They are taking [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1381.16s)]
*  the debris from munitions fired at Gaza by Israel and they are retrofitting them into their own [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1385.72s)]
*  weaponry. There's an old Al Jazeera documentary from 2006. It was an Al Jazeera Arabic. It's [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1391.32s)]
*  called Hosted by the Rifle. And it's a documentary where an Al Jazeera correspondent goes into Gaza [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1399.8799999999999s)]
*  and he interviews people from Al Qassam Brigade's engineering corps and they show him the process [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1405.64s)]
*  of manufacturing their own grenades, their own rockets, their own rifles. And in that, he does [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1411.5600000000002s)]
*  an interview, the correspondent, with Mohammed Daif. Mohammed Daif was widely credited as being [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1416.92s)]
*  the Palestinian that modernized Al Qassam brigades into a fighting force capable of doing an operation [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1424.92s)]
*  like occurred on October 7th. And so they have created factories in the tunnels for the manufacturer [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1432.6s)]
*  of their own weapons, often using ordinance that Israel has fired at them and then repurposing it [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1440.84s)]
*  to create their own weaponry. What happened on October 7th was in the context of Palestinian [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1446.6799999999998s)]
*  resistance, utterly spectacular. Whatever you think about the actions, who was killed, how were they [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1453.24s)]
*  killed on October 7th, what they managed to do was a total shock to the system, the national security [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1461.0s)]
*  system of Israel. They were able to breach multiple Israeli military facilities with almost no [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1467.8s)]
*  resistance whatsoever and come away with upwards of 250 captives, including many dozens of Israeli [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1474.84s)]
*  soldiers, not to mention seizing computer hard drives, papers, and other intelligence from these [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1482.44s)]
*  Israeli bases and bring them back into Gaza with them. It was the most stunning and successful attack [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1488.68s)]
*  that any Palestinian resistance forces have ever launched against the state of Israel. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1495.72s)]
*  And it was all planned in total secrecy using weapons that were overwhelmingly manufactured [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoJGJo66YF4&t=1502.1200000000001s)]
