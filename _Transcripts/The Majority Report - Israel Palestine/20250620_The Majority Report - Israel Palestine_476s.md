# Charlie Kirk's DESPERATE Israel-Iran Spin Exposes Trump's Weakness
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU)
*  You have this problem if you're a right-winger because you have nothing to talk about because the immigration stuff all the polling is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=0.0s)]
*  Starting to go south on you all of it. You have pitched [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=7.36s)]
*  Donald Trump. It's fundamentally different than [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  the deep state and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=16.32s)]
*  You have been pitching Donald Trump to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  young people and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=22.56s)]
*  the thing that they love about Donald Trump is he's not [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  The same old same old he's authentic and the other thing that they love about Donald Trump. He is anti-war [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=28.880000000000003s)]
*  he is not going to get as mired in some type of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=36.04s)]
*  Conflict some faraway country on behalf of somebody else's interest. No, we got America first and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=42.28s)]
*  despite the fact that the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=51.6s)]
*  Reconciliation bill will cut [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=55.0s)]
*  Millions of Americans health care and despite the fact that it will also [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=57.36s)]
*  keep food literally out of the mouths of millions of Americans and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=61.44s)]
*  Despite the fact that it's you know [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=67.8s)]
*  Giveaway and some there's the tiny couple of giveaways [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=70.2s)]
*  We're giving away several hundred million dollars in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=73.1s)]
*  special favoritism tax cuts and just and despite the fact that the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=76.4s)]
*  Overwhelming 80% of the tax cuts go to the wealthiest in this country [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=81.08s)]
*  We still have the fact that Donald Trump is not going to get us into needless wars [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=85.16s)]
*  What do you do if that's been your pitch and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=92.8s)]
*  It starts to look like Donald Trump is going to get us into a needless war and in fact has been [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  Midwifing attacks on [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=104.72s)]
*  Iran despite the fact that they pose no threat to the United States and frankly a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=107.56s)]
*  minimal threat to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=115.2s)]
*  No more or less than any other country certainly in that region and there's such little [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=117.4s)]
*  Popular support for this. I mean comparing it to the fervor after 9-eleven [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  This is a entirely different scenario is public opinion about Israel is in the shitter and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=129.24s)]
*  This administration is trying to sell a deeply deeply unpopular [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=136.0s)]
*  War intervention to the public right now, and what do you do? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=142.12s)]
*  What do you do well if you're Charlie Kirk you tell your your followers hey I [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=147.48s)]
*  Think it's time for you to take a little nap [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=156.48s)]
*  He [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=159.0s)]
*  Writes on Twitter when things are moving very fast and people are losing their minds [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=160.12s)]
*  It's important to stay grounded turn off your phone read scripture spend time with friends and remember [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=165.32s)]
*  Internet fury is not real life. It's going to be okay [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=172.2s)]
*  Don't pay attention to the news for a while because it may not comport with what I have been suggesting for a while [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  So this is this is after a couple days a couple days earlier [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=184.64s)]
*  He did a poll here of his followers because apparently he didn't know his position on this [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=188.88s)]
*  Should the u.s. Get involved in Israel's war against Iran [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  90% of a half a million votes just about said no and 10% said yes [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=197.55999999999997s)]
*  And so Charlie had said Trump voters especially young people supported President Trump because he was the first president in my lifetime [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=203.56s)]
*  Not to start a new war which? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=210.04s)]
*  It's one thing to provide defensive support for our allies when missiles are raining down on civilians, but there is historic Joe Biden started work [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=212.28s)]
*  I mean, maybe he was the first president. I guess he was there for Gaza and Ukraine which they talk about but [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=219.2s)]
*  Starting it is another thing, but there is a certainly little support for America to be actively engaged in yet [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  Another offensive war in the Middle East we must work and pray for peace and now [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=231.26s)]
*  It's we need we don't need to work and pray for peace. We need to read scripture and turn off our phones. Yeah, let's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=235.76s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=242.44s)]
*  Don't pay attention guys [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  We're not gonna win this one guys. It's summer. So how about you hit the beach and we'll see you in the fall [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  This is like a more scientific poll is the AP that did it a few months ago [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=255.64s)]
*  But I just think this is a really interesting development [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=260.48s)]
*  I saw this cited and I was reading a good article by our friend Ed and German to him on his sub stack about how like the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  Anti-war movement needs to be rebuilt to kind of combat this and that there was a lot of false promises [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=270.16s)]
*  That were taken a little too seriously by meant by Republican [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=277.56s)]
*  Supposed anti-war people but among the Republican base at least like and this is probably a reaction to Gaza and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  to Ukraine but a majority of Republicans say that they want the United States to take a [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=290.20000000000005s)]
*  less active role in foreign affairs [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=296.92s)]
*  and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  only [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=301.04s)]
*  24% say more active role now like again this changes if the whatever politician is [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=302.24s)]
*  Saying it and who's communicating it [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=307.72s)]
*  but this is like what you see some of these right-wing influencers and and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=309.88000000000005s)]
*  like people like Marjorie Taylor green are responding to there is is like [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=315.16s)]
*  Now Fox News. Yeah, they're talking to the grandpas and they're very well funded, but there's more there's really well funded [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=319.32000000000005s)]
*  Online Republican media that has a different position on this a little bit [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  No doubt here is here is Marjorie Taylor green on [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=333.2s)]
*  one American Network [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=338.56s)]
*  with [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=341.12s)]
*  What was his name again? I've forgotten him already Matt. Matt. It's almost attorney general [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  I thought you were joking. No, I honestly [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=348.52s)]
*  As soon as I can shuffle like one of these characters out of my in the front of my brain I will do it [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  and I [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=360.08s)]
*  Frankly was hypnotized by his forehead. I find that fascinating [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=361.56s)]
*  Hey for weeks all we've heard is how Trump's big beautiful bill will cut Medicaid [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  But almost no one's reporting on a buried provision that would make Trump [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=371.08s)]
*  Untouchable go to ground dot news slash majority to see how this bill would block judges from enforcing court orders [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=374.8s)]
*  Unless you the citizen post a bond first [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=383.0s)]
*  Highly credible sources warn most people can't actually afford to do this and that's pretty obvious [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=386.48s)]
*  So if this bill passes and Trump violates the law it wouldn't even matter and nobody even knows [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=392.04s)]
*  Which means the GOP's flood the zone strategy is working and it's why I think ground news is the best tool to expose these [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=398.64s)]
*  blind spots before it's too late [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=405.78000000000003s)]
*  My partner's built the only app and website pulling in news from across the globe [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=408.32s)]
*  then breaking down each sources bias credibility and the news the right tries to bury and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=413.12s)]
*  Considering most people take the first article they see online as fact their browser extension is essential [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=420.04s)]
*  What it does is it flags the sources bias and links other credible reports to verify the information [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  Ground news is a better version of how we're already staying informed [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=432.0s)]
*  So I got you 40% off the same unlimited access vantage plan that I've been using [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=435.72s)]
*  That's just five dollars a month when you go to ground dot news slash majority scan my QR code [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=441.16s)]
*  Or redeem the code majority if you're using the app with at least another four years of this [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=447.36s)]
*  They're counting on you to be distracted this app is how you stay focused [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNVZeivx6MU&t=453.32000000000005s)]
