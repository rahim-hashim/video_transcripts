# Trump’s Middle East Gambles | Matt Duss | TMR
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw)
*  Sam Seder on the Majority Report, Emma Vigeland out today, joining us in studio. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=0.0s)]
*  Only the only people that ever come into studio, the only people that we actually allow into the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  studio. Thank you. Executive Vice President of the Center for International Policy and former Foreign [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=10.88s)]
*  Policy Advisor, Senator Bernie Sanders, Matt Duss. Matt, as always, a pleasure to have you here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=17.04s)]
*  Thanks very much. No, I came, I think the first time a couple years ago, you can't keep me away [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=23.52s)]
*  from the studio now. Yeah, that's it. We are the only person we let in outside of, you know, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=27.36s)]
*  occasionally the people who work here. And, but we've got a lot of things happening, obviously, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=32.24s)]
*  on the foreign policy front. The most prominent of which is, you know, I don't know that we've [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=39.12s)]
*  ever really had any conversation in the many years that we have talked about foreign policy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Have we talked about tariffs, except for maybe in passing, and certainly not in the context of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=53.199999999999996s)]
*  what is now a burgeoning trade war. China has announced that as of tomorrow, they will put a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=61.28s)]
*  84% tariff on any goods that are coming in from the United States to China. That would be our top [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=69.52s)]
*  five or soybeans, aircraft and engines, integrated circuits, pharmaceuticals, and petroleum [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=79.36s)]
*  products. A lot of stuff. A lot of stuff. Farmers are going to get hit hard, obviously, with this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  And of course, we also have what appears to be 104% tariffs on Chinese goods coming in here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=95.76s)]
*  Aside from the turmoil that it's going to cause in this country economically, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=104.64s)]
*  and I would imagine in other countries around the globe, and we're seeing weird stuff in the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=110.4s)]
*  Treasury market, particularly in terms of the dynamic with the stock market, leaving that aside, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=115.44s)]
*  aside, what does this do in terms of changing the physics, it feels like, in the international [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  space? Right. Yeah. Going back to what you said about tariffs, in Trump's first term, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=136.8s)]
*  after decades of this kind of economic theology of free trade that saw tariffs as this no-no, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=142.72s)]
*  Trump kind of reintroduced this idea of using tariffs as a tool. I love tariffs. Trade wars [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=148.8s)]
*  are very easy to win, but that was pretty tightly focused on China and maybe a few other places. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=153.44s)]
*  Now it's a trade war with everyone based on this weird formula that they came up with based on [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=157.68s)]
*  trade imbalances, regardless of what tariffs other countries have on us. And it really is just a [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=163.92s)]
*  massive restructuring of the US-led global trade order and leading to what? I don't know. That is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=171.44s)]
*  part of what's so concerning here is that he does not seem to have a theory of the case beyond, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=180.72s)]
*  we'll do this and then something will happen, and then things will be better. He's just using [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=186.88s)]
*  these as a blunt instrument to get what better deals bilaterally with all of these countries. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=191.6s)]
*  I can't see it. I don't think anyone has offered a real explanation of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=198.88s)]
*  how he gets from A to B to C here. Yeah. It's not even clear where C is. And just to sort of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=202.96s)]
*  walk through a little bit, like you mentioned, Trump imposed tariffs on China in his first term. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=208.48s)]
*  I think they were about 10% and I think they were more or less across the board. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=214.88s)]
*  Biden expanded these a little bit. Maybe they were... Trump's tariffs were with steel and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  aluminum becoming China. And Biden expanded these a little bit, but also essentially provided [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  a trade war goes two ways, obviously. And so when you're keeping certain products out, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=239.2s)]
*  the idea is that you want to essentially onshore these products, either in terms of the way that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  they're processed or manufactured, and you need to provide for both. There needs to be a sort of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=252.88s)]
*  stick and carrot type of relationship to growing an industry in there. And we had that under Biden. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=260.4s)]
*  We have the largest expansion of manufacturing jobs that we've had. But there isn't that second [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=266.48s)]
*  part here. And what also strikes me, aside from... And at this point, everybody's saying the same [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  thing. There's nothing that comes after the end. We're going to do this and nobody knows what the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  second part of that is, because it can't onshore... Like he said yesterday, pharmaceuticals. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=288.8s)]
*  It's not like there's pharmaceutical factories that are just sitting around waiting for demand. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=297.76s)]
*  Waiting to be revved up, exactly. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=303.36s)]
*  You got to build these things and they're not... They got to be pretty clean, apparently, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=304.64s)]
*  because these are contaminations and stuff like this. But I'm thinking to Obama, the last thing [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=308.56s)]
*  he tried to do before he left was the TPP, which is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=316.32s)]
*  essentially to try and isolate China and get all of Asia, but China essentially, into one [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=323.36s)]
*  trade regime that was to inhibit Chinese hegemony. And that seems to be like, we've just [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=334.4s)]
*  thrown all that out the window. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, that basic idea, if Trump's goal is to limit China's economic growth or to use these tools as [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  a weapon against China, you do want to have allies. He's making that much more difficult. Now, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=351.2s)]
*  personally, I have concerns about China and their policies, but I don't think that limiting Chinese [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=356.56s)]
*  growth is a way to frame this. And I'll just go back to Obama. The TPP, I think, and this is one [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=362.24s)]
*  of the reasons I think Trump won, is because he really came in and said, this economic model, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  this kind of theology that all of Washington and the global economic smart guys have subscribed [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  to for the past decades has not worked for us. We need something different. Now, that basic [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=384.56s)]
*  conjecture is right. Bernie said the same thing. Now, Bernie has a different idea of how we should [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=388.88s)]
*  fix this system. But since 2016, Washington has been going through these stages of growth [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  grief of, OK, what did we get wrong? Do we need to change, give Biden some credit because he did, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=400.96s)]
*  his administration did recognize, OK, we need to build a post neoliberal global economic order [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=406.79999999999995s)]
*  and started to do that. Trump just seems to have no idea other than we're going to use trade now [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  as a weapon to get things that I want. And meanwhile, everything else that was bad about [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  that trade order, weakening the state, weakening the social safety net, getting the government, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=424.4s)]
*  essentially pulling the wiring out of the administrative state, those were also things [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=429.84s)]
*  that were bad about the global trade order. And Trump is tripling down on that. That's the weird [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  thing is that there's like a third thing that the problem with the TPP, you could have two [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=438.88s)]
*  separate problems with it. One is like, why do we have to aggressively isolate China? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=446.0s)]
*  Right. But the mechanism in which that was done with the TPP, which was the most problematic in [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=454.64s)]
*  my estimation was we're giving up all sovereignty to corporations in this international dispute. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=460.64s)]
*  ISDS, I can't remember. The problem with free trade is not free trade. It's that it prevents [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=467.76s)]
*  states, governments from intervening on behalf of their own workers. That's the problem with it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  And this is sort of like it's almost as if Trump has found a third way to do the bad things. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=477.84s)]
*  To take the worst part. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=486.96s)]
*  To take the worst parts of both of those things and put them together. So what does this do to, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=488.32s)]
*  and then I want to move to sort of specific areas around the globe, but what does this do to [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  foreign policy more broadly speaking? Because it seems to me that there's going to be a lot of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=501.92s)]
*  countries who are going to say, and I think we talked about this in 2016 and through the years [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=510.32000000000005s)]
*  of the Trump years, which was the rest of the world has to say like, okay, maybe you go to, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=515.84s)]
*  after Trump, it's going to be somebody else, but there's a problem in your society that you would [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=522.24s)]
*  go to Trump. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=529.0400000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=529.84s)]
*  You could go back to Trump or somebody worse, and it turned out to be Trump and worse. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  It seems to me that in the context of trade, there's going to be a lot of people who are [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=538.8s)]
*  going to just say like, we're going to go into a different order. And that's going to have [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=542.8s)]
*  implications, not just in terms of trade, but everything else. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=547.76s)]
*  Right. We're going to seek to continue multilateralism just without the United [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=550.88s)]
*  States and in many ways defensively against the United States. We've already seen this happening [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=555.04s)]
*  with US adversaries, right? The kind of aggressiveness even pre-Trump that the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=560.7199999999999s)]
*  United States after 9-11 started to use sanctions tools, the Treasury secondary sanctions to punish [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=564.2399999999999s)]
*  countries, to punish terrorist groups, but also countries that were seen as not doing what we [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=570.64s)]
*  wanted on those issues. We started to see bandwagoning and alternative sources and possibly [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  currencies, but now our friends are doing it, right? Because it was like, okay, fool me once [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=581.1199999999999s)]
*  with Trump. Joe Biden came back and said America's back, everybody chill out. We got [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=585.28s)]
*  this under control. Their illusions are being dashed now, probably too late, but you definitely [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=590.24s)]
*  see that happening. And so even if we were to get after this a different probably, I don't know if [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=595.04s)]
*  I want to say more normal administration, because I don't even know what normal is after this, but [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=600.88s)]
*  we are past going back. In some ways, listen, this might be controversial now, but I'll say [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=606.96s)]
*  that's probably good because I think- I was just going to say, I mean, I'm not convinced that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=612.72s)]
*  you know, maybe our time of being the world's sort of like cop and, you know, conductor, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=617.12s)]
*  you know, maybe we were done with that. Right. I mean, I think it took far too long for this memo [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=628.0s)]
*  to land. I mean, you know, a lot of Donald Trump is in so many ways a symptom as well as a cause, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=632.9599999999999s)]
*  but a symptom of a failed, you know, corrupt set of institutions. So yeah, I mean, it's challenging [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=638.56s)]
*  in some ways scary, but to think through, okay, what does that new order look like? What's America's [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=645.28s)]
*  role in it? But ultimately, we need an economic policy that does what Trump says he wants to do, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=650.0s)]
*  which is protect American workers. And I'm just not seeing that right now. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=656.48s)]
*  Right. I mean, I am all for, you know, being USA number, you know, two, three. Okay. I mean, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=660.0s)]
*  I'm not convinced that that's going to mean it, except for the fact that he's also trashing our [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=669.44s)]
*  economy. Like we don't have what he's doing. I can imagine a scenario where like this is a [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=676.32s)]
*  seven-year plan or an eight-year plan. And we need to like flood the country with, you know, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=684.4000000000001s)]
*  funds to make this transition, but without it, right? He's doing it in two weeks and he's doing [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  the second part first. Right. And he seems, and this tends to be one kind of consistent through [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=699.4399999999999s)]
*  line is his deep suspicion of multilateralism. He believes in just bilateral agreements. The concept [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=705.36s)]
*  of multilateralism, he sees that as a way for other countries to gang up on the United States. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=713.28s)]
*  When he talks about the European Union, I mean, he has said this, he said the European was created [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=719.12s)]
*  to screw the United States. That's why he's, you know, he's opposed to it. So this is what he's [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=723.36s)]
*  talking about now. I'm going to hit all these countries with these massive tariffs and then [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=729.92s)]
*  go back to them one by one and renegotiate deals that will be good for us, i.e. me. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=734.0s)]
*  It's also seems to be the sort of the same strategy that Elon Musk is doing. We're going [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=739.84s)]
*  to fire everybody and then find out which people control the nuclear codes or the pandemic stuff. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=743.6s)]
*  And then if we can get them back, we get them back. Exactly. We're going to take apart the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=750.56s)]
*  government and then figure out what everything does. So amidst this sort of like, sort of like [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=754.0s)]
*  moving target, like how do you form like, is there any type of foreign policy? Broadly speaking, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  I want to ask you again about the specifics, but how do you formulate a foreign policy when it seems [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  like not only are the people that you want or the other parties that you want to develop a policy [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=775.44s)]
*  towards always in flux, but you're in such dramatic flux. Yes. Right. I mean, you have to try and pay [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=783.2800000000001s)]
*  attention to other things that are happening. There's a lot of crises around the world, some [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=790.8800000000001s)]
*  of which the US is deeply implicated, but that, you know, the challenge of separating the signal [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=793.84s)]
*  from the noise here is the name of the game. And it's always difficult, but coming up with good [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=799.2s)]
*  policy at a time when Trump is in the process of destroying so much wealth and not just, you know, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  people talk about, you know, the stock traders and the very wealthy. It's not just that, as you know, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=812.32s)]
*  I mean, this is, these are workers retirement accounts, you know, these are, you know, not [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=816.32s)]
*  just the very wealthy who are being hurt by this. So it is hard. And we should say like in a week or [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=820.32s)]
*  two, I mean, I think we were saying this, we're going to have a much better notion of just who's [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=826.4s)]
*  going to be hurt by this. Like, you know, farmers starting tomorrow are going to be in a full on [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=829.92s)]
*  panic. And, you know, small businesses, when they starting to see like, wait a second, the stuff I've [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=835.04s)]
*  got coming in from China, whatever the plastic bags or whatever it is that I've got, they're [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=841.12s)]
*  not releasing them unless I pay twice the amount that I thought they were going to cost. And the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=846.0s)]
*  thing that kind of frightens me about this is that when this really hits, and Trump starts to if he [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=850.32s)]
*  if this outrage starts to penetrate his bubble, what does he do? How does he try to distract or [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=856.88s)]
*  externalize that right? And here I'm thinking about that, that like notorious comment from [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=863.44s)]
*  Frid Zocariah back in I think it was April 2017, when Trump struck Syria. And Frid Zocariah goes, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=868.5600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump became president today. Was he I thought there was like a half a dozen people who [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=874.72s)]
*  said variations on that. But what that taught Donald Trump is that when you get into trouble, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=879.52s)]
*  a way to make Washington like you is to press this button. Right. So the question is, what horrible [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=884.16s)]
*  misadventure does he consider doing? You know, to make people liking him again, because unfortunately, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=890.24s)]
*  that's still part of Washington sickness is like up starting up a war, everybody rally around the flag. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=896.16s)]
*  I mean, that is, you know, sickness, I think a lot of countries have, frankly, it's my sense, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=902.64s)]
*  it's not unique to the way that you create that nationalism is to create but it doesn't feel like [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=908.24s)]
*  I mean, let's talk about let's talk about Iran, and in the Middle East, and then we'll, you know, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=914.64s)]
*  work our way down through into the Middle East from Iran, and then maybe swing back up to Ukraine. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=923.12s)]
*  It seems like Iran would be the most likely place that we would strike it this way. I mean, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=932.8s)]
*  we've been striking Yemen for two weeks straight now. And to the point where I'm reading stuff, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=937.68s)]
*  we're like, naval commanders are saying we should have used the cheaper bombs. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=946.4s)]
*  Yes. I mean, like literally running through standoff weapons here to, you know, little effect, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=950.4s)]
*  apparently, as again, no one who's been watching the effort to bomb the crap out of the Houthis [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=956.16s)]
*  for the past literally 10 years should be surprised by this. I mean, if you read that, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=961.04s)]
*  that signal chain, it is the plan was quite literally, we're going to do this but harder, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=966.32s)]
*  and that will work. And it has not worked. Why? I'm just out of curiosity. Why has not that not? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  Why? Why has it been so hard to, to stop the Houthis? I mean, they're very Saudi Arabia was [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=979.5200000000001s)]
*  bombing them. We were supporting that. We were providing all the support. Exactly. Intelligence, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=986.48s)]
*  refueling weapons, all this stuff. They're dug in there, you know, they are, it's their country. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=991.84s)]
*  Right. Right. Is always something you need to keep in mind. And so trying to do this [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=997.6s)]
*  from the air or through, you know, the cruise missiles and such. It has a very bad record [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1002.32s)]
*  of working. You can do damage. Certainly you could hit certain facilities. You can kill a lot of [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1009.0400000000001s)]
*  people. We certainly seems to have killed a lot of, we are good at doing that. But dealing with [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1012.64s)]
*  the problem by bombing it is not something that really seems to work. So Iran would be [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1019.6s)]
*  the next candidate, it appears to me, and it certainly had been feeling for a while like the [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1027.84s)]
*  between us bombing Yemen and Israel going back into Gaza and going into Syria and also, you know, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1036.24s)]
*  sort of sporadic attacks on Lebanon after the wake of their mini war, I guess, with Hezbollah. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1048.32s)]
*  But it also appears that Trump now has decided that he wants to get back into the deal essentially [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1058.96s)]
*  that he crashed 10 years ago. Or some new version of that deal. Yeah. I mean, that was a pretty [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1064.32s)]
*  remarkable set of statements he made in the Oval Office with Netanyahu. And I have to say, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1069.84s)]
*  this was yesterday. Yeah, I just I enjoyed watching Netanyahu sit there as Trump basically said, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1074.56s)]
*  Yeah, we're gonna have direct talks with Iran, which are a good idea. I mean, we should be talking [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1080.08s)]
*  to Iran. We have real issues with them. We should be talking to them. Obviously, you want these talks [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1084.8s)]
*  to be as well prepared as possible. I mean, we saw this with North Korea and Trump's first term [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1089.52s)]
*  talking with North Korea talking with Kim Jong-un is a good idea. Unfortunately, he did not seem very [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1093.92s)]
*  well prepared. You know, he just went he did a photo op. What did we get out of it? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1098.64s)]
*  I don't think we got much out of it. So I hope we won't simply see a rerun of that. But as a basic [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1104.16s)]
*  principle, yes, we need the way to deal with Iran's nuclear program is through a negotiated [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1109.76s)]
*  agreement. Trump 12 run up back in 2018. He seems interested in getting a new one. I think you know, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1114.8000000000002s)]
*  you mentioned the way things seem to be going, we seem to be preparing for some kind of action be [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1121.68s)]
*  two bombers over in the region, another carrier strike group. Was this just signaling to Iran [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1126.4s)]
*  that we are serious about option B if they don't want to do option A and talk? Perhaps. But it does [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1131.8400000000001s)]
*  seem from statements coming from Tehran from the Supreme Leader from the IRGC that they are interested [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1137.1200000000001s)]
*  or more interested than they have been in the recent past. And I think that's positive. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1142.24s)]
*  I mean, it also occurs to me now in 2025, that Iran has been incredibly [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1146.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what the word is. It ranges from reluctant to considered in terms of not building [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1157.28s)]
*  a nuclear weapon, because they have been supposedly on the brink of this for what seems like since the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1165.6s)]
*  invasion of Iraq. Yes, right. Yeah, I mean, I think that the first report, I believe it was 2002, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1173.2s)]
*  when that intelligence was publicized that there's evidence that they had a nuclear [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1178.3999999999999s)]
*  program, a nuclear weapons program. But our intelligence community has assessed that they [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1184.8799999999999s)]
*  have not made that decision to go forward. So they're keeping that option open, but they have not, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1189.52s)]
*  you know, countries that get a bomb usually rush for it. It's a small sample set, but that's what [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1193.6s)]
*  the sample set is. And at the same time, Iran has been weakened by some of the actions that [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1198.8s)]
*  Israel has taken with US support. You know, they lost a major ally or their major ally, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1204.8s)]
*  Hezbollah has been weakened. I think the loss of Assad was a huge deal. Again, that was done by, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1209.36s)]
*  you know, with Turkey's support, not Israel. But the loss of the Assad regime was a huge deal. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1214.72s)]
*  So yeah, I can understand why they- What did the Assad regime do for Iran in terms of strengthening [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1222.8799999999999s)]
*  it? I mean, it received incredible amounts of support funding, but also just physically as a [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1229.0400000000002s)]
*  as a land passage from, you know, Iran to Iraq, through Syria into Lebanon, to resupply and support [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1236.5600000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah. That's gone. Now, I think the danger is you always have kind of this little chorus of [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1242.64s)]
*  hawks in Washington for whom the time to bomb Iran is always now. And right, their argument is, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1248.8000000000002s)]
*  well, Iran is weakened, now is the time to really do it. And I think now is the time when [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1254.88s)]
*  to actually take talks with Iran seriously, when they could sign on to an enforceable and solid set [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1261.6000000000001s)]
*  of concessions around their nuclear program. Because if they get the sense, you know, given [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1268.16s)]
*  how they have been weakened, have lost some real allies in the region, a nuclear deterrent looks [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1273.1200000000001s)]
*  much, much more attractive to Iran right now. And I don't like that equation. So I think making it [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1278.3200000000002s)]
*  clear to Iran that they can get security another way would be the best move for the US right now. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1284.56s)]
*  So let's turn towards Ukraine. Donald Trump had promised that he was going to end this [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1291.04s)]
*  in the first week of his administration, maybe the first day. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1301.12s)]
*  It'll be very easy. He told us it would be very easy. Well, I guess before we get to Ukraine, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1305.12s)]
*  let's go to I mean, you mentioned Netanyahu sitting in the Oval Office with Trump. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1310.24s)]
*  We had a brief, essentially like ceasefire, I guess, Israel has now seems to have ratcheted up [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1319.0400000000002s)]
*  its assault on Gaza at a time where I think like the Palestinians living, you know, the Gazans are [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1330.0800000000002s)]
*  completely exhausted. And it feels like they have just Yeah, I mean, I can't even imagine now we [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1337.84s)]
*  have been we're having jets bomb tents. Israel just seems to be paired with the and I don't know, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1347.28s)]
*  I mean, I have felt this is the case for almost for over a year, but [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1358.56s)]
*  it seems they are completely unabashedly. Like there's no longer any pretense of what they're [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1365.6s)]
*  doing. It has been over a month since they've let in aid. We're getting reports from the UN now of [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1372.96s)]
*  like, this is just we're it's incredibly dire. Yeah, Gutierrez called it a killing field. He [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1379.84s)]
*  used those words. And there does not seem to be any international pressure whatsoever, because [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1385.76s)]
*  even with when Biden who was abysmal on this, Biden felt pressure, theoretically, right? I mean, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1395.12s)]
*  he didn't respond to it. But there was some pressure. I would argue that it actually caused [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1403.52s)]
*  Harris was one of the big reasons why she lost her election. But there is no pressure on Trump, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1410.0s)]
*  it seems like at all other than from the area. Madelson. Yeah. And so what is there any constraining [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1419.1200000000001s)]
*  Israel in this instance at all? Unfortunately, right now? No. I mean, because any pressure, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1427.1200000000001s)]
*  the only meaningful pressure on Israel was going to come from the United States. I mean, I think [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1431.76s)]
*  that was why there was so much pressure and attention on Biden. The enormous intelligence, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1436.48s)]
*  arm support, diplomatic, political support, the United States and Europe can do things, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1441.84s)]
*  but Europe just tends not to do things if the United States doesn't go first, or at least give [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1446.8s)]
*  them a green light. And Biden simply would not do that. Right now, as you said, there's no pretense [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1451.44s)]
*  anymore. Back in the early days of the war, they would bomb a hospital and be like, Hamas was there, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1456.4s)]
*  we're sorry, here's all the reasons we had to kill all these civilians. And now they don't even [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1462.32s)]
*  bother. It's just going forward. I mean, they killed what was it 15 aid workers and buried them [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1465.84s)]
*  like they essentially assassinated them and they buried them in a mass grave. And only because it [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1471.76s)]
*  was all caught on film, they're like, okay, whoops, we're looking into it. And the idea of that video [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1477.36s)]
*  existing like six months ago, or a year ago, something so explicit, but it barely makes a [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1483.28s)]
*  ripple in the news. Yes, they have slowly methodically and successfully rewritten the [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1493.44s)]
*  rules of war, essentially, with us support. And now with Trump, you know, he came in, he sent [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1498.3200000000002s)]
*  Wyckoff over, put, you know, pressured BB to sign the ceasefire back in January, we had a couple [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1503.8400000000001s)]
*  months of that. And let's understand the terms of that ceasefire was that phase one will continue [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1509.52s)]
*  until phase two is agreed upon. The ceasefire was supposed to continue as the parties to continue [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1515.6000000000001s)]
*  to negotiate Netanyahu abrogated that he broke that ceasefire. What is Europe? I mean, I feel [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1520.48s)]
*  like Europe is about to sort of turn against Israel, but that it's not going to be terribly [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1532.48s)]
*  relevant. No, unfortunately not. And I, you know, I see some pockets of resistance there. But in [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1540.24s)]
*  general, I mean, you know, every time, you know, the the Stromer government in the UK says something [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1546.32s)]
*  critical, they kind of walk it back the next day. Germany, unfortunately, is completely, you know, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1551.36s)]
*  is right kind of focused on arresting and beating up, you know, pro Palestinian protesters in Germany. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1556.96s)]
*  So really, it's hard to say who is going to lead that opposition. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1563.76s)]
*  Um, it's, I mean, I guess, you know, I guess I was just looking at yesterday, I guess today was [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1568.1599999999999s)]
*  Stammer had said, you know, we need a probe of the killing of all these, you know, emergency workers, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1578.1599999999999s)]
*  we need a probe. Yes. Let's let's have a probe. Yes. I guess that would be involved. Like, let's [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1585.36s)]
*  watch this video. Exactly. Well, I mean, we have it on video. I honestly don't know how much more [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1591.04s)]
*  evidence you could possibly have in any instance. And just horrific. Yes. Let's probe the person who [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1595.6s)]
*  took this video and find out their true feelings. And we should remind people that person is dead, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1601.76s)]
*  shot in the head by by Israeli soldiers. All right, well, let's turn to Ukraine for a moment. The [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1608.1599999999999s)]
*  the there's been what feels like some type of steelmate for a while. Trump had Zelensky here, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1621.1200000000001s)]
*  I guess it was a month ago now. Yes. Where it felt like a very staged moment where JD Vance was [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1630.0s)]
*  brought in to basically yell at Zelensky for not dressing properly and for not being thankful [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1638.96s)]
*  enough. And it all felt like some type of KFAB thing. I don't think Zelensky was in on it. But [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1647.2s)]
*  I think he understood like these guys have to sort of like make it some type of show. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1655.52s)]
*  Because they're not really there wasn't a dramatic shift in policy that I think people anticipated. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1664.88s)]
*  Well, I mean, initially, I think there was I mean, I don't know how staged it was. I mean, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1671.6000000000001s)]
*  I'll say JD Vance clearly had a plan. Right. I think, you know, I know that Zelensky was [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1674.96s)]
*  advised both by his own people and by members of Congress who support Ukraine to say like, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1680.88s)]
*  say, the minimum possible in this Oval Office meeting, do not allow yourself to be provoked. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1685.92s)]
*  And then and then negotiate in private afterward at the lunch. Unfortunately, he allowed himself [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1691.92s)]
*  to be provoked. And again, I don't know, it's hard to criticize him, given what he's endured, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1698.08s)]
*  given the fact that he's sitting there in a room with all of Trump, you know, Trump and Trump's [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1703.04s)]
*  flunkies all around him. And then it seems as soon as JD Vance introduced this idea that Zelensky was [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1706.56s)]
*  being disrespectful, that's what completely set everything off, because that's the thing. And [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1711.68s)]
*  Vance knows this is that that's what Trump can't tolerate. So yeah, that that went poorly. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1715.76s)]
*  Zelensky then I think understood that he had to show very quickly that he was not the problem. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1722.8s)]
*  He is ready to sign a deal. He is ready to negotiate peace. And I think he signaled that [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1727.68s)]
*  very effectively. And that did what he wanted to do, which is to put the onus back on Putin, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1731.92s)]
*  frankly, where it belongs. And I think that's where we are now, because Ukraine has made clear [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1736.8000000000002s)]
*  that they are ready to talk. And Putin and you know, Russia, they're the ones who are like, well, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1742.16s)]
*  we'll talk after Zelensky is gone. We'll talk after, you know, you know, you all Ukrainians [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1746.64s)]
*  are standing on one foot. He's introducing, you know, all kinds of bizarre conditions. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1751.1200000000001s)]
*  What? What is how much pressure? I mean, does is does is Putin have a domestic pressure to do [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1756.4s)]
*  anything? I mean, what what is the status? It feels like there is just a stalemate there. And [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1765.52s)]
*  and then I want to get to this thing about the Chinese soldiers. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1773.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know what pressure Putin feels domestically. He has pretty tight control [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1776.96s)]
*  over his own domestic situation. I mean, I think he has a conception of his own legacy and Russia's [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1781.6s)]
*  security and what that requires. And it was true two years ago, a year ago, I think it's true today [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1788.32s)]
*  that requires, you know, erasing Ukraine as an independent sovereign state, either through [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1795.1999999999998s)]
*  installing, you know, a Russian controlled government or just a more pliable Ukrainian [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1801.76s)]
*  president who is not Zelensky. And that is not something that Ukraine's going to agree to. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1806.56s)]
*  And do we have a sense of what the Ukrainian people? I mean, you know, the the there was a [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1813.6799999999998s)]
*  narrative that that that was being pushed by the Trump in the in the right. It felt like a month [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1818.6399999999999s)]
*  ago that Zelensky was forcing his people to into this meat grinder and against their will. And he [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1825.6799999999998s)]
*  was a dictator, they were saying. And and and then that just sort of went away with whatever [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1833.84s)]
*  deals Zelensky said to me. Is it really that straightforward that it's just a question of [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1842.8s)]
*  Zelensky basically made Trump feel like he was daddy and then daddy just said, OK, all is forgiven? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1848.8s)]
*  I mean, I mean, there was a method to it. Clearly, they were using all these tactics to put pressure [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1858.0s)]
*  on Zelensky to come, you know, to come to the negotiating table because they want they I think [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1863.36s)]
*  Trump genuinely wants to be able to broker a Russia Ukraine peace deal. And Trump didn't realize that [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1868.8s)]
*  Putin was probably the the the problem here? Perhaps he didn't. I mean, Trump does have his [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1874.24s)]
*  own view. He thinks he understands Putin. I mean, some people say he admires him. I think there is [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1879.6s)]
*  some evidence of that, although I don't want to overstate it. But, you know, he let's remember he [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1884.56s)]
*  has a pretty bad impression of Zelensky from from the first term as well. So he's not positively [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1889.6s)]
*  predisposed to Vladimir Zelensky. But I think, you know, for the time being, Zelensky seems to have [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1895.36s)]
*  dealt with his Trump problem internally. To your question, you know, I think we have seen public [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1900.8s)]
*  opinion slowly weakening as the war goes on. I don't think that's totally surprising. It's always [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1906.0s)]
*  been weaker, you know, as the closer you get to the front, the Ukrainians who are having to endure [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1910.8799999999999s)]
*  the most of this warfare. You know, you also do have, you know, Ukraine has been careful about [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1915.52s)]
*  the age of conscription. They don't want to be conscripting all of their young and younger men. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1920.8799999999999s)]
*  They do want to have a population into the future. And so that also contributes to a sense of [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1925.92s)]
*  resentment. Who's having to fight, who's not having to fight, who's trying to avoid fighting, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1930.72s)]
*  and who's getting away with it, who's bribing. So yes, there is, you know, a tense political [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1935.28s)]
*  situation internally. But I think all evidence shows that Zelensky still is seen as a legitimate, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1939.6s)]
*  democratically elected president. What is, what to be made of? Apparently they have, they have captured [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1946.0s)]
*  two, presumably Chinese soldiers who have credit, Chinese credit cards and an ID. I mean, that, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1953.6799999999998s)]
*  what do we make of that? Yeah. I mean, they, they captured two and fought a group of six, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1964.8799999999999s)]
*  is my understanding. The Chinese government has said these are independent, you know, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1968.8799999999999s)]
*  essentially Chinese mercenaries. You know, I think China has been trying to make itself part of the [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1973.04s)]
*  solution here at the same time, continuing to support pretty massively Russia's efforts. So [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1981.04s)]
*  they're both part of the problem and part of the solution, but wanting to be a major global player [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1986.56s)]
*  to say that we can help broker, we can help broker peace. But this is going to complicate [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1991.2s)]
*  that too, which is why I think they've been, you know, pretty quick to try and say that we [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=1997.1200000000001s)]
*  had nothing to do with this. What is, what, like, if I know that there were two Chinese soldiers [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2000.72s)]
*  captured and that they were, they were fighting six others, it feels like that's on purpose. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2007.44s)]
*  Like there's a lot of different ways you could respond to finding, you know, to capturing these [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2014.0s)]
*  guys, which is like, unlikely China's sending six guys to fight. Right. And unlikely that they're [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2018.8s)]
*  going to be in this type of position. Like, I imagine we have American military over there, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2027.44s)]
*  but they're not, you know, on the front lines fighting that they're doing, you know, support [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2032.72s)]
*  stuff or something that, so I would imagine if China, if China was participating, they would [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2039.36s)]
*  have something similar. So what is, what is Zelensky trying to do with that? No, I think [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2044.8s)]
*  he's clearly trying to use this to, you know, to push China to play a less destructive role. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2050.64s)]
*  But I think as you noted, that is what's interesting about where these, these Chinese [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2057.68s)]
*  soldiers were captured. I mean, we've seen North Korea involved in the war, but the fact that [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2061.2799999999997s)]
*  these Chinese soldiers were caught in Ukraine is quite notable. And I think Zelensky is using that [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2066.08s)]
*  to put some pressure on China to do what I'm not quite sure. Does that also tell us something? I [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2072.48s)]
*  mean, in the event that they are mercenaries, which it seems most likely to me that the [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2079.52s)]
*  mercenaries are like that, that Russia needs mercenary fighters there. I mean, that does [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2086.8s)]
*  seem kind of sketchy to me again. I, I, I, I, I'm very skeptical. I mean, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2093.44s)]
*  I mean, China does have pretty tight control over its military and over its industries, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2097.76s)]
*  including potentially its own mercenary industry. So yeah, this, this excuse doesn't really ring [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2103.12s)]
*  true. We need to find out more. I mean, were these, you know, you know, quote unquote observers [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2109.68s)]
*  who, who, who got cornered, found themselves in combat that they were not supposed to be in [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2115.52s)]
*  and tried to fight their way out. I'm not sure. What else have we left on the table, Matt? I mean, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2119.6s)]
*  it feels like everything's moving in so many directions. And, and from our perspective, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2127.12s)]
*  at least, you know, the sort of the biggest player is not moving on any trajectory that is [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2134.7999999999997s)]
*  like plotted. It just feels like, you know, one of those, I got a cat toy for my cat that you just [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgBgphTecw&t=2142.08s)]
