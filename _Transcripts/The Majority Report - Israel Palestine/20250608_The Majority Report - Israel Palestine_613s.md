# Israel Can Win Every Battle But The War Is Already Decided
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70)
*  We are back and we are joined now by David Hearst, co-founder and editor in chief of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=0.0s)]
*  Middle East Eye, his recent piece for Middle East Eye is entitled, Israel Has Already Lost [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=4.44s)]
*  the Gaza War. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=8.78s)]
*  It Just Doesn't Know It Yet. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=9.78s)]
*  David, thanks so much for coming on the show today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=10.78s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=13.32s)]
*  So I almost want to start with where your piece ends with this sentence, Israel may [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=14.8s)]
*  win each battle as the Americans did in Vietnam, but it will lose the war. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=20.6s)]
*  Can we work back from there? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=26.46s)]
*  What brings you to that hypothesis based on what we've seen of, you know, a year and a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=27.76s)]
*  half of genocide at this point? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=33.56s)]
*  Well, it's not an original thought. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=35.2s)]
*  It's been said by quite a few people who have actually fought quite hard on Israel's behalf, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  not least its former Mossad chief. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=44.44s)]
*  It is the feeling that they win every battle because technologically they're just so much [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=49.88s)]
*  superior to the Palestinians and what the Palestinians can reply. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=56.92s)]
*  But that there are two things that Israel is not under Israel's control. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=63.28s)]
*  It can't crush the Palestinian spirit or as the Palestinians would say, the Palestinian [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  resistance, which could be violent or nonviolent. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  And the more it tries to to basically kill, the more it's actually hitting a civilian [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=78.7s)]
*  population and just generating another generation of fighters in 10, 20 years time, which is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  exactly who is fighting this war right now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=92.54s)]
*  If you think of the generation that's fighting this war, this is a post Oslo generation that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=95.22s)]
*  has seen no progress since Oslo in its in in their own national aspirations, and some [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=102.42s)]
*  have sold their taxes for guns and I've interviewed them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=110.46s)]
*  The other thing that is that has changed in this war is international opinion. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  And that's where the parallel with Vietnam comes in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=120.02s)]
*  You know, in fact, if you go back, LBJ was told by the CIA in 1967 that there was a stalemate [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=121.66s)]
*  with the Viet Cong, but it took seven more years to actually pull out and another president [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=129.18s)]
*  under Nixon to pull out of Vietnam. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=138.18s)]
*  Here what we have is a quite rapidly deteriorating situation of Israel's image internationally. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=142.01999999999998s)]
*  And I think there is a marked change of tone now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=150.78s)]
*  You know, 18 months on, I mean, for me, everything that Israel has been criticized of today could [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=154.33999999999997s)]
*  have been said in October or November 2023. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=162.85999999999999s)]
*  But the fact that it's being said now is, I think, interesting. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=166.73999999999998s)]
*  What do you make of that then? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=172.17999999999998s)]
*  Is it the the what what do you make of the change in kind of liberal posture towards [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  this? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=182.3s)]
*  And we can expand outside of the United States here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=182.82000000000002s)]
*  The European Union, I know, said, I guess, two days ago that they're reviewing their [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=186.5s)]
*  political agreements with Israel. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=191.86s)]
*  You see the prime minister in the UK with a little bit more of a chiding tone towards [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  the Israelis. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=201.9s)]
*  Where do you see that shift having happened? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=203.82000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there's also a joint statement of condemnation by Britain, France and Canada. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=206.26s)]
*  And that could lead to an early recognition of the state of Palestine by all three countries [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=211.78s)]
*  in the not too distant future. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=217.66s)]
*  Now, I don't know. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=218.98s)]
*  I just don't know what has led to this, because for someone like me that's been covering this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=220.66s)]
*  and covering every death, not me personally, my website, you know, every doctor killed, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  every hospital destroyed, every child star to death. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  You can say, why now? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=237.3s)]
*  You know, what's actually changed? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=238.5s)]
*  Is it statements about mass starvation coming from the UN? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=240.94000000000003s)]
*  Is it because Israel has only today allowed 90 trucks in after, I think, 11 weeks of total [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  blockade? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=250.02s)]
*  Was it the clumsy attempt to cover up the killings of the those Red Crescent first responders [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=251.22000000000003s)]
*  in Ra'afah? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=256.22s)]
*  Is it the fear that when the International Court of Justice actually comes to a ruling [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=257.86s)]
*  on genocide, every leader, every leader that allowed Israel's campaign to continue under [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=262.58s)]
*  a spurious banner of a right to defend itself could be regarded in law as an enabler of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=267.62s)]
*  genocide? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=271.82s)]
*  Or is it lip gloss, another form of cover? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=273.14s)]
*  Now, the cynical, the cynical me says it's the latter because hours after the British [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=276.09999999999997s)]
*  Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced sanctions on Israel, an RAF plane took off from a British [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=281.26s)]
*  base of Akrotiri in Cyprus to conduct a surveillance mission over Gaza. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=286.78s)]
*  And Lammy is not suspending arms supplies or parts of drones or parts for the F-35s. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=292.54s)]
*  So and only weeks before, Lammy met his counterpart, Gideon Saar, Israeli Foreign Minister, in [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  what was called a private visit. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=305.62s)]
*  And yet Saar is a key member of the cabinet that collectively stopped all food going into [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=307.1s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=312.26000000000005s)]
*  So you could say this is just to cover a very shaky position. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=313.66s)]
*  But that said, I think the cumulative effect on Israel will be real diplomatically. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=322.18s)]
*  You mentioned the Oslo process. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=328.98s)]
*  Can you take us back a little bit into that history and explain to people how that more [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=331.06s)]
*  pro-Israel agreement than is traditionally written about in the West [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=340.70000000000005s)]
*  aided and abetted, I guess, the choking off of potential diplomacy in the aftermath of it [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=348.22s)]
*  and increase the level of, I guess, impunity that Israel has experienced in the decades since? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=356.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, Paul, just going into that thing, that there's something very, very concrete that Oslo [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=368.38s)]
*  allowed. Oslo allowed the biggest wave of settlement of the West Bank in the history of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=372.46s)]
*  the conflict. And so you had peace and you had this massive and sudden wave of settlers [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=380.21999999999997s)]
*  turning up in the West Bank. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=385.65999999999997s)]
*  I forget the numbers, but if you go back over the figures, it's very clear that I think Oslo [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  produced for Israel something like 325,000 settlers that hadn't been there before. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=391.82000000000005s)]
*  So that's what was a gain for the concept of Greater Israel, because you've got to remember [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=397.18s)]
*  that Israel is not terribly interested in Gaza biblically or historically or ideologically or [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=403.98s)]
*  religiously. It is far more interested in the West Bank, which continues to call Judea and Samaria. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=409.34000000000003s)]
*  What Oslo did was provide a process that never came to anything for the Palestinians, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=416.06s)]
*  but provided concrete gains for the Israelis. Settlers I've already mentioned, but it also [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=421.90000000000003s)]
*  provided this paradigm, this myth, that if only the Palestinians got themselves together, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=427.26000000000005s)]
*  they had the right leadership, if only there was the right alignment of stars with the Israeli [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=435.1s)]
*  public, you'd have a Palestinian state, which of course never ever happened. And all of that has [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=440.46s)]
*  come, the basis of what I would call the Friends of Israel or liberal Zionism, the idea, the belief [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  in a homeland for the Jews that could enable, that was in Israel for all its citizens, that could also [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=459.09999999999997s)]
*  enable a Palestinian state to be born in a two-state solution. That has very much crumbled [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=466.46s)]
*  in Benjamin Netanyahu's hands, and he has really set himself a life's mission of preventing [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=471.26s)]
*  stifling a Palestinian state at birth. That is what he will go down in history for, and that is [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=479.97999999999996s)]
*  go down in history for, and that is what he's proudest of. He says it openly now, and in fact, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=487.18s)]
*  on the question of a Palestinian state, this is the one issue in a very, very divided Israel, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=498.78s)]
*  which has people, Israelis say, a civil war boiling between liberals and hardliners [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=504.62s)]
*  on the judicial front. That's one point of agreement. There are votes in the Knesset, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=511.5s)]
*  which are near 100% votes on the question of whether a Palestinian state should ever be allowed [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=518.7s)]
*  to be born. There's complete consensus on the Palestinian question between the so-called [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=524.38s)]
*  opponents of Netanyahu and Netanyahu himself. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=535.74s)]
*  That answer is no. That answer is no. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=540.62s)]
*  Basically, the answer is no. I think the international community have yet to catch up [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=544.0600000000001s)]
*  with the reality that a two-state solution was something that could have happened [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=549.1s)]
*  with the Arab Peace Initiative in 2002, the Saudi Arabian plan, but that train has left the station. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=554.54s)]
*  Yes. I mean, there was, I think, some polling out of the University of Tel Aviv that shows that an [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=560.06s)]
*  overwhelming majority of Israelis support Donald Trump's ethnic cleansing plan for Gaza. So, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=570.9399999999999s)]
*  the scope of what is liberal and what is conservative thought within Israel is quite [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=576.86s)]
*  different than I think a lot of Westerners would like to imagine or what we've been told [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=585.02s)]
*  about what political consensus is in Israel. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJGfjz_pM70&t=589.9s)]
