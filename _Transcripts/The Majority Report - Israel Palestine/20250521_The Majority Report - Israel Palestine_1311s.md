# Columbia President Booed By Grads Chanting "Free Mahmoud"
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4)
*  You ever had one of those jobs where you can't do anything right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=0.0s)]
*  Is this the third president or acting president of Columbia in like four months or whatever it is? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=2.4s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=10.24s)]
*  Interim head coach of the Hornets. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Which is incredible because Columbia, they had all of these accusations of anti-Semitism [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=12.48s)]
*  with their presidents where they, by and now by the administration, but by their donors [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=18.96s)]
*  and people like Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, who pulled his money [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=25.6s)]
*  they banned pro-Palestine activism, including Jewish Voices for Peace in November 2023, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=30.48s)]
*  calling this, that Jewish group and other pro-Palestinian groups anti-Semitic. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=38.72s)]
*  And they crack down on protests, allowed the NYPD to go in and roughhouse their own students, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=43.44s)]
*  and they're still being penalized for it by the administration. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  So they have to crack down even further. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=54.32000000000001s)]
*  Also, they ignored pleas by Mahmoud Khalil about like his concerns about ICE. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=56.32s)]
*  And he's now been in detention for 72 days. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=65.76s)]
*  It's so happy that Romesa Ozturk is out, that Madhavi is out, the other Columbia student, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=68.88s)]
*  but he's still in detention, Khalil. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=78.0s)]
*  It's been since March 9th and his son has been born. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=81.12s)]
*  He hasn't been able to meet him. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=83.92s)]
*  If there was a way to short the number of applicants to Columbia in 2025, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  fall 2025, I would do it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=97.12s)]
*  But here is acting President Claire Shipman being welcomed to the Columbia [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  College's graduation ceremony. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=108.0s)]
*  Claire Shipman. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=110.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=115.04s)]
*  Good morning, class of 2025. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  I know that many of you feel... [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=137.6s)]
*  Good morning, class of 2025. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=153.2s)]
*  I know that many of you feel some amount of frustration with me. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=156.0s)]
*  And I know you feel it with the administration. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=162.16s)]
*  And I know we have a strong, strong tradition of free speech at this university. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=167.6s)]
*  And I am always open to feedback, which I am getting right now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=182.0s)]
*  The work of your generation will be to shape these interesting times, to define the values... [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=188.56s)]
*  Free speech. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=197.6s)]
*  People in the back on their phones. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=207.12s)]
*  I waited you out. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  The work of your generation will be to define and shape these interesting times, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  to define the values in the direction of this century. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=236.16s)]
*  To be clear, there was a clip in there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=239.12s)]
*  There was a cut. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  So it was later in the speech that people started chanting, free my mood. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=243.6s)]
*  And, you know, graduations are so long as they are. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  The idea that they were willing to extend it by screaming at her, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=255.68s)]
*  it shows the level of commitment and disdain they have for their institution. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=259.44s)]
*  It really is like... [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  And a lot of these universities, not all of them, but some of them, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=270.64s)]
*  made huge, huge miscalculation in that they could negotiate with the Trump administration. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  Or even their own board of directors. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=281.68s)]
*  Because they've lit themselves on fire in two different ways. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=284.88s)]
*  They both are still subject to attacks from Republicans. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=289.92s)]
*  They're going to try and roll back their tax-free status on their endowments. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=298.0s)]
*  Frankly, in some instances, I got no problem with that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=305.6s)]
*  But the other is that they've lost the support of the students and future students. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=308.4s)]
*  If your student body has a significant percentage of people who are protesting about an issue, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=324.4s)]
*  it is more than likely that your applicant pool also feels that way. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=331.44s)]
*  Right? I mean, it's not a coincidence. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  Some schools attract more politically-minded students than others. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=342.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  That's why NYU appealed to me. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=347.2s)]
*  What was the guy named Zach from Silicon Valley? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=349.44s)]
*  The way he said, like, it's stuff's only for the marketing materials. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=351.84s)]
*  It's like I took digital media activism classes about how to change society from NYU. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=360.4s)]
*  And it's amazing to hear her invoke the history of Columbia protest at the university. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=361.85999999999996s)]
*  Because it's quite true that the student body there has had a history of protesting, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=370.97999999999996s)]
*  including occupying Hamilton Hall, which became Hinn's Hall, in the protest against the genocide. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=378.09999999999997s)]
*  The little girl who was killed by Israel and her last words are on tape. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=384.74s)]
*  But there have been previous occupations of the campus that was met also by the administration [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=392.26s)]
*  back in the day, calling the police. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=399.3s)]
*  In the 1960s, there were protests where Hamilton Hall was occupied and the police were called [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=401.62s)]
*  on them. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  Into the 70s, police called on protests towards the Vietnam War. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=409.7s)]
*  And eventually, the administration, I think, apologized for some of these incidents. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=415.62s)]
*  It might have been the South Africa protests, too. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=420.82s)]
*  I'm forgetting the exact circumstance. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=423.06s)]
*  But I remember reading a student saying that they were happy to use the protest for marketing [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=425.78s)]
*  material. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=432.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=433.78s)]
*  But they exclude and perhaps, oh, we've moved past this. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=434.1s)]
*  But they don't bring it forward into the current context. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=438.34000000000003s)]
*  They are repressing speech even possibly more aggressively than they had in the past, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=442.98s)]
*  as they use the history of protests at the university to sell students on the experience [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=448.1s)]
*  of coming to the school. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=453.94s)]
*  Yeah, take out a giant loan to come work for us about how to be an activist. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=454.66s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=458.82000000000005s)]
*  But isn't that almost like liberal commodification of protests? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=459.54s)]
*  Literally that personified, I mean, not personified, but in a nutshell. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=463.78000000000003s)]
*  That is literally what it is. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=467.54s)]
*  And it's for her to stand up there to talk about Columbia's tradition as people are booing [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=468.9s)]
*  her and one of their fellow students has been in prison for nearly, well, it's been over [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=476.9s)]
*  three months with complicity of the people that put her in the place that she is. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=484.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=488.26s)]
*  It's been like a year. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=489.85999999999996s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=491.38s)]
*  It's been a really I went to Columbia. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=492.82s)]
*  It's been a very. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=494.82s)]
*  I can't hear him. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=495.85999999999996s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=496.58s)]
*  I changed it because. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=496.97999999999996s)]
*  Oh, hello. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=498.65999999999997s)]
*  Can you hear me? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=499.78s)]
*  I was just saying it's been a very enraging time to be a graduate of Columbia. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=502.09999999999997s)]
*  I went there and I can't tell you the number of people who I went to school with who have [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=507.62s)]
*  been sending around petitions for people to sign and like petitions saying they'll never [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=513.46s)]
*  give to any of the endowments or anything like that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=519.38s)]
*  And to Matt's point, like the reason I decided to go to Columbia was in part because of the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=523.62s)]
*  network, because of the amount of people that you would meet who later on would then be [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=527.86s)]
*  people in positions to help you professionally. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=532.98s)]
*  And I think that the university is going to have like a major reckoning with this rift [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=536.5s)]
*  between the school and the alumni. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=541.86s)]
*  And I will say today is very proud and happy day to be a graduate of Columbia. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=544.1s)]
*  And this clip is actually like it's been sent to me now by probably five or six of my former [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=549.7s)]
*  classmates who are just so ecstatic to see this happen. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=554.74s)]
*  Oh, that's awesome. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=557.46s)]
*  It is awesome. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=558.58s)]
*  And I mean, just the news today is underscoring why these protests are as just as anything. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=559.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=566.6600000000001s)]
*  The United Nations humanitarian chief went on the BBC this morning and said that 14,000 babies [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=568.58s)]
*  could starve to death in the next 48 hours if aid trucks do not reach Gaza. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=577.22s)]
*  They've let in. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=585.38s)]
*  My understanding is about a half a dozen aid trucks when the number that they probably need [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=586.34s)]
*  is closer to five to six hundred a day. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=591.22s)]
*  And the UN is pleading saying we have hundreds of trucks lined outside the border. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=593.54s)]
*  Israel's just not letting them in. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=598.26s)]
*  They let like five in, as you say, five or six, which is almost which is it's a troll. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=599.4599999999999s)]
*  They're mocking the idea of it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=605.3s)]
*  Dropside had a clip. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=607.4599999999999s)]
*  It's in Hebrew. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=608.8199999999999s)]
*  But Ben Gavir saying a few PEDAs will be let in. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=609.6999999999999s)]
*  It's all it's exactly what we want to see in the videos. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=613.14s)]
*  The purpose allows the world to continue providing us with international protection. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=615.6999999999999s)]
*  We are annihilating everything that remains in the strip. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=620.66s)]
*  You declared simply because it is one big city of terror. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=623.06s)]
*  No more raids with ins and outs. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=626.18s)]
*  We are conquering, clearing and staying until Hamas is destroyed. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=627.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, they admit this. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=631.54s)]
*  And yet our media is twiddling its thumbs talking about people's manners, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=633.38s)]
*  about how they're opposing it. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=637.3s)]
*  And part of it, I mean, frankly, the reason why we're talking about Joe Biden as much [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=641.3s)]
*  is because the one of the biggest anchors of cable news wrote a book about it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=645.38s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=653.86s)]
*  I mean, this is my attitude about all this stuff, too. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=655.06s)]
*  John Stewart. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=658.66s)]
*  The idea of reporters holding back news of the day. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=660.42s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=666.02s)]
*  I mean, Woodward did this, too. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=666.98s)]
*  Like it was just gross. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=669.38s)]
*  It's gross that Woodward did it right with Trump, with his books, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=672.34s)]
*  with Trump and with Bush and with Bush. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=675.86s)]
*  But Woodward doesn't isn't an anchor on a daily news show. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=678.5s)]
*  Like, I mean, he's more in the interest of writing books. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=681.38s)]
*  So I get that more. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=683.7800000000001s)]
*  He was he was a reporter. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=685.38s)]
*  He was he was writing. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=687.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, he was a I don't know, daily reporter, but certainly was was was putting stories in there [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=689.38s)]
*  on a weekly basis. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=694.5s)]
*  And they'll hold back important things, you know, to make their book juicy. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=696.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm just trying to underscore the the cynicism of what Tapper is engaging in here is because he [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=700.1s)]
*  has a nightly news show where he could have been reporting this or he's on the news basically [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=706.26s)]
*  every single day. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=711.46s)]
*  But he every day. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=712.82s)]
*  And he's getting paid very well to do that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=713.86s)]
*  He's getting paid millions of dollars, most likely to supposedly provide us with facts [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=716.58s)]
*  and information unless he wants to hoard it and commodify it for a book. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=722.26s)]
*  I'm very anxious right now. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=726.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm very nervous, very anticipatory. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=727.62s)]
*  And it's not about whether Russia and Ukraine will be settled. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=730.02s)]
*  It's not whether somebody can stop Netanyahu. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=733.46s)]
*  Somebody please. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=736.4200000000001s)]
*  It's not whether Taylor's unfriended Blake. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=738.6600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=741.62s)]
*  No, like most people in America, I am most looking forward to reading a book. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=745.46s)]
*  But when? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=751.3s)]
*  When? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=754.0999999999999s)]
*  We're back with breaking news in our politics lead and a brand new excerpt from my upcoming [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=756.0999999999999s)]
*  book with Axios' Alex Thompson. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=760.5799999999999s)]
*  It's called Original Sin. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=762.5799999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure if you've heard of it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=763.62s)]
*  It's on Biden's decline. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=764.9s)]
*  It's called Original Sin. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=765.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you've heard on May 20th. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=766.74s)]
*  That's Tuesday. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=768.0999999999999s)]
*  Original Sin. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=768.9799999999999s)]
*  That's coming out in three weeks. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=769.78s)]
*  On May 20th. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=771.78s)]
*  That's just 19 days away. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=772.5799999999999s)]
*  You're going to be able to hear it. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=774.02s)]
*  It's going to be a great book. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=775.14s)]
*  It's going to be a great book. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=776.26s)]
*  It's going to be a great book. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=777.14s)]
*  Three weeks. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=778.18s)]

*  That's just 19 days away. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=779.8599999999999s)]
*  In one week and one day. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=781.2199999999999s)]
*  Coming out in just a few days. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=782.8199999999999s)]
*  Comes out Tuesday. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=784.02s)]
*  You will not believe what we found out. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=785.4599999999999s)]
*  Don't news people have to tell you what they know when they find it out? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=787.3s)]
*  Isn't that the difference between news and a secret? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=810.5799999999999s)]
*  You won't believe what we found out. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=818.26s)]
*  No, that's why I'm watching. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=821.62s)]
*  Breaking news. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=824.9s)]
*  In a week. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=826.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I thought he did a good job there. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=829.06s)]
*  There's another part if we wanted to watch it. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=832.02s)]
*  Just another guy said Woodward literally held back Trump confirming COVID was airborne [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=833.8599999999999s)]
*  versus the virus in the peak of the pandemic. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=837.8599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=840.9799999999999s)]
*  Hey, how much more significant could you get than that? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=841.8599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's not necessarily timely. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=844.5s)]
*  That's one for the history books. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=848.58s)]
*  Information in a pandemic. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=849.86s)]
*  Come on. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=851.78s)]
*  I mean, I have a very low opinion of CNN. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=853.14s)]
*  It's just plugging his book. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=856.66s)]
*  Listen, I don't mind him plugging his book. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=860.34s)]
*  If the book and I don't even mind it if it was like here's the TikTok of what went behind [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=863.38s)]
*  the scenes. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=867.94s)]
*  But if there was information. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=869.06s)]
*  There's writing books about eras like that that provide like insight into why things [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=871.4599999999999s)]
*  happened, etc, etc, that are more for like a historical understanding and for a bigger [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=877.8599999999999s)]
*  picture and to understand sort of broad strokes. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=884.02s)]
*  But if there's information in there that could have changed the trajectory of history. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=886.9s)]
*  Because it was so sort of like binary that even the case of the book. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=895.14s)]
*  Casual observer would have changed their behavior. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=901.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=904.3399999999999s)]
*  Like nobody's going to say like, well, you know, he had an advisor who was used to work [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=904.5799999999999s)]
*  for the senator and so that there was a more interest in doing this trade deal as opposed [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=910.9s)]
*  to doing a different deal. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=916.9799999999999s)]
*  You know, none of that information is going to reach your average view. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=918.8199999999999s)]
*  But if like the idea of, oh, he can't tie his shoes or he can't chew his own food or [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=921.9399999999999s)]
*  something like that to me seems like you need to report in the moment. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=931.06s)]
*  How about this? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=935.9399999999999s)]
*  Dave Wagle pointed this out on on Twitter the other day that in the book there was [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=936.66s)]
*  apparently a fundraiser where Biden said the same story twice in three minutes at a fundraiser. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=942.5799999999999s)]
*  So speaking in September 2023 and a lot of people heard it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=949.6999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=955.8599999999999s)]
*  This is at a Democratic fundraiser. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=956.18s)]
*  And yet that wasn't reported. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=958.5s)]
*  That would have been really relevant information ahead of an election that we were told was [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=961.06s)]
*  as serious as the results are indicate or showing us right now with what Donald Trump [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=967.38s)]
*  is doing to this country and to the world. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=971.78s)]
*  But you know how important it is sometimes to repeat something in this business so that [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=973.6199999999999s)]
*  people really gets into people's heads. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=977.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I can't believe we were doing the like hiding FDR's condition from the public [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=980.0999999999999s)]
*  thing in 2024. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=986.7399999999999s)]
*  But it's not even for national interest. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=989.22s)]
*  It's for Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson to commodify their book. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=991.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=997.14s)]
*  The New Yorkers, Jane Mayer pointed this out on the podcast. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=998.58s)]
*  I love to hate the New Yorker political scene. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1001.78s)]
*  She was saying a lot of the times when these people write these books, they negotiate these [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1004.74s)]
*  terms that like tie their hands from reporting or things are embargoed until the book comes out, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1009.22s)]
*  which, yeah, I guess there is some utility, as you guys are saying, like to get that access [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1014.9s)]
*  to this historical information. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1020.18s)]
*  But also what you're doing is you're allowing these people to then absolve themselves of [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1021.54s)]
*  having participated in this thing, sometimes allowing them to be quoted anonymously and [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1027.7s)]
*  sometimes absolving them publicly and having them now say, like, look at all this bad thing, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1033.3799999999999s)]
*  all this bad stuff that happened. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1040.1s)]
*  Now I'm on the right side for having admitted it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1041.1399999999999s)]
*  The problem is that when you enter into those negotiations, the idea that I'm going to be [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1043.86s)]
*  able to commodify this later. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1051.78s)]
*  And he's so desperate. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1055.78s)]
*  I find it hard to believe that that was that tough of a negotiation. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1057.9399999999998s)]
*  Let's put it that way. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1060.9799999999998s)]
*  I mean, because you do have other things. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1062.1799999999998s)]
*  There is value to these people not to piss Jake Tapper off. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1066.6599999999999s)]
*  There is value for them not to burn the bridge of a reporter who knows something. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1071.5400000000002s)]
*  So the leverage dynamic, I think, based upon my experience, is overstated when it behooves [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1075.8600000000001s)]
*  the person cashing in. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1084.8200000000002s)]
*  Like the lack of leverage. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1087.46s)]
*  The only way I could have gotten this information that he was not eating solid foods was if I [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1089.5400000000002s)]
*  promised to report it in Q2 of 2025. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1098.42s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1105.54s)]
*  But do we know when? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1106.42s)]
*  So, for example, in the Tapper book, do we know when he started it? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1108.42s)]
*  Well, yeah, like if he's getting a lot of this damning information from people after the election, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1111.78s)]
*  then, you know, then it's really on the people who are quoted and cited in the book. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1117.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't know if that's necessarily clear when they began. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1123.54s)]
*  You told Megyn Kelly about his actual coverage during the time. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1128.58s)]
*  I feel a sense of humility about my coverage. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1131.8600000000001s)]
*  It's not that I was asking about his favorite movie or color. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1134.18s)]
*  We were talking about Putin. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1136.74s)]
*  We were talking about other issues. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1137.54s)]
*  But of course, I look back on my coverage with humility. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1138.98s)]
*  I wish I'd covered the issues of age and mental acuity more. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1141.3s)]
*  Do I wish that in that 15 minute interview with Biden in October 2022, that was the only [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1144.26s)]
*  subject? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1148.34s)]
*  Yes, knowing what I know in May 2025. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1149.06s)]
*  CNN has a history of allowing their star anchors to have side gigs that are maybe conflicts of [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1153.7s)]
*  interest. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1160.58s)]
*  Here you go, Russ. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1161.46s)]
*  Chris Cuomo had to leave CNN because he was on the side giving his brother advice on the sexual [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1162.5s)]
*  harassment allegations against him. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1171.54s)]
*  And that was considered a conflict of interest because it would inhibit his reporting on his [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1173.46s)]
*  brother, who was the governor. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1180.18s)]
*  And that seems pretty straightforward. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1181.54s)]
*  And he was still knowingly engaging in that side gig. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1183.3s)]
*  This is also something that inhibits Jake Tapper's honest reporting on the Biden [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1187.06s)]
*  administration. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1190.58s)]
*  If he knew for months and months or however long that this was a real problem but wasn't [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1191.22s)]
*  revealing that to his audience, that is also a conflict because you are conflicted between your [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1196.74s)]
*  job as a reporter and an anchor on television where you're supposed to be giving people the [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1204.02s)]
*  news and your financial incentive to withhold that information for your own book. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1207.94s)]
*  It's funny that Jake says, I was asking him about Russian stuff because I think if Biden had [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1216.98s)]
*  different positions on, say, Russia, Ukraine or maybe Israel, Palestine, Tapper might have not [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1220.98s)]
*  overlooked some of those signs that he did for that entire time. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1225.46s)]
*  You think if Bernie said the same exact story at a fundraiser as if he'd be at some fundraiser like [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1228.42s)]
*  this twice? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1234.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1235.5400000000002s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1235.7800000000002s)]
*  I mean, in the same way when Trump is saying like, people are going to have to get by, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1236.66s)]
*  little girls are going to have to get by with two or three dolls. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1242.18s)]
*  If Bernie had said that kind of thing, I mean, they would start impeachment hearings yesterday. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1244.66s)]
*  So, incidentally, for all the talk about Bernie Sanders' health in the 2020 primary, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1249.8600000000001s)]
*  sounding as sharp as ever. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1259.8600000000001s)]
*  I'll repeat what I said that entire time. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1261.14s)]
*  Biden's problems were mental. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1262.98s)]
*  Bernie's clearly weren't. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1264.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1266.02s)]
*  That noise signals or sound, I should say, signals that we have mistakenly called into the [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1268.42s)]
*  phone system and that we're going to do it one more time. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1278.98s)]
*  646-257-3920 is the number. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1283.46s)]
*  646-257-3920 is the number. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjec-_jar4&t=1288.98s)]
