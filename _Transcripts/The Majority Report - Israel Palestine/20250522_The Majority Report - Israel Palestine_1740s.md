# Trump Is Making Israel Backers Nervous
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4)
*  Sam Seder, Emma Vigeland on the Majority Report. Joining us now, Jeet Heer, National Affairs [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=0.0s)]
*  correspondent for The Nation, host of the weekly Nation podcast, The Time of Monsters. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=6.16s)]
*  But did I get that right? You got that right. Yeah. I think you have a future in radio. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=12.72s)]
*  I think Jeet is under a future. I'm not sure. I'm right. I wouldn't say a good future, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=20.88s)]
*  but a future. Thank you. Jeet Heer, welcome back to the program. I think Jeet needs his own song. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=25.52s)]
*  I think we're like at that point potentially at this level. Working class hero, John Lennon. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=33.04s)]
*  We can't do, we have to do, we cannot do. You have to pay money. Yeah. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=43.04s)]
*  Also not the rights for that. It has to be an original song. Oh, okay. Yeah. So something [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=47.04s)]
*  public domain. Yeah. Maybe a minstrel song. I don't know. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=50.08s)]
*  All right. So Jeet, Donald Trump returning back from his Middle East tour. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=57.28s)]
*  It's really fascinating, this dynamic. We spoke to Jeremy Scahill earlier in the week, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=68.08s)]
*  specifically about his interview he did with one of Hamas's top leaders and their perspective on [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=74.72s)]
*  the Trump administration and how their experience has been with the Trump administration. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=82.48s)]
*  Much of it boils down to, Trump is so transactional that he wants certain deals and God knows what the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=90.64s)]
*  kickbacks are associated with these deals. You may have some ideas, but he wants these deals with [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=101.92s)]
*  the UAE and Saudi Arabia and Qatar perhaps. And their ask may be, you have to, we don't know what, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=109.36s)]
*  but it may involve Palestinians in Gaza. And if it puts a dollar in Trump's pocket, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  I think that's basically what it takes. What's your sense of what's been going on? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=127.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think to understand what Trump's doing, we do need the contrast [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=132.96s)]
*  with Biden. And I will say that in contrast to Biden's, I think, gross incompetence [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=140.48s)]
*  and ideological policy of commitment to Zionism above all else, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=150.48s)]
*  Trump, as bad as he is, kind of looks a little bit better. And I would say it's not just me that's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=155.68s)]
*  saying this. Axios had this report from officials from the Biden administration. Some of them [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  speaking on the record, basically saying that they're in awe of what Trump is doing, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  which is that he's actually changing the dynamic in the Middle East. Notably, having a U.S. having [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  direct negotiations with Hamas, which Biden was never willing to do. But beyond that, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  I think in the broader Middle East, negotiating with Syria, meeting the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=187.12s)]
*  former head of the Syrian leader, who Trump said is a good-looking guy, very strong. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=194.08s)]
*  Very attractive. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  Very attractive. This is like a guy who is like, you know, former al-Qaeda, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=201.44s)]
*  killed American troops. But he can bench press. He can bench press. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=208.24s)]
*  But he is good-looking. But more importantly, I actually think on a more cynical level, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=213.44s)]
*  I actually do want an American leader who's willing to negotiate with foreign adversaries, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=217.52s)]
*  which Trump is willing to do. But also opening up negotiations with Iran, which again, Biden was [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=222.8s)]
*  never willing to do. And actually, I mean, it looks like Trump's terms are basically going to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=230.48s)]
*  be the same as Obama's, which is like a typical Trump thing, which is you tear up Obama's deal, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=234.56s)]
*  then you renegotiate the exact same deal, but put Trump's name on it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=240.48s)]
*  But this is why it's a miracle that Biden didn't or what we almost should thank Biden for being [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=244.48s)]
*  such a rabid Zionist is because if he had reentered into it, Trump would have scrapped it. But now he [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=249.04s)]
*  can say the Iran deal is mine if he actually follows through. If he follows through, we'll [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=253.92s)]
*  get to that. But okay, so this is on the broader Middle East. But also, I mean, he followed Biden's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=259.52s)]
*  policies of trying to bomb Yemen, this crazy policy of thinking that that could actually work. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=265.2s)]
*  But then he like backtracked and basically said, you know, we've got what we want, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  which is again, like actually achieved nothing, but like has basically like, you know, made it [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  agreed not to like bomb Yemen and is going to continue to allow Yemen to bomb Israel, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  which is like an amazing thing. So all these things really do represent a shift in American [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=288.4s)]
*  foreign policy. I have to say we have to start with the low bar of Joe Biden, like Biden's policies [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=294.4s)]
*  were so disastrous that by contrast, Trump actually looks like he's actually willing to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=300.56s)]
*  do something. And I think that it's not just like a matter of personal character. I think there is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=306.08s)]
*  an ideological dimension, which is that Biden, it's not just that he was a Zionist. He had this [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=311.84s)]
*  very Cold War mentality that American power is based on alliances. You want to build up NATO, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  you want to build up AUKUS, you want to build up the Abraham Accords, right? And you don't [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=322.88000000000005s)]
*  negotiate with enemies. Biden was unwilling to negotiate with Russia, Iran, or China, really. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  Whereas Trump is exactly much more transactional. And he does not see the world in terms of these [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=336.16s)]
*  ideological blocks and is much more willing to make deals. Now, these deals, I will say, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=341.84s)]
*  if it's a more foreign policy that's more open to diplomacy, it's a diplomacy of corruption. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=349.44s)]
*  I actually think the leader of Syria, Ahmed al-Sharah, I actually think very intelligently, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=357.12s)]
*  he promised to build a Trump Tower in Damascus. If you do that, you're going to get Trump's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=363.44s)]
*  life sanctions. Yeah. Can I just jump in for a sec? Because I agree with you a lot, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=370.8s)]
*  G. But I have maybe a bit of a difference in that. Our Israel policy is already politics of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=375.44s)]
*  corruption, right? So if Qatar is going to try to ingratiate Trump in a non-traditional way, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=382.0s)]
*  and it stops the genocide of Palestinians, I'm all for it. Because we know that the next four [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=389.6s)]
*  years Trump's just going to try to get rich. But my concern is that even though he's breaking [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=394.16s)]
*  these traditional liberal international order, like Cold War mentality, NatSec orthodoxy things [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=400.4s)]
*  that I agree is actually very productive, or maybe not productive, but it's a good thing in theory, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=406.88s)]
*  like these deviations are worthless if he doesn't restrain Israel because we're now seeing, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  yesterday was the 77th anniversary of the Nakba. The reports that we can get out of Gaza from the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=418.56s)]
*  last 72 hours has been that the slaughter is unimaginable. People were posting their last words [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=424.56s)]
*  last night. And so I am all for deviating from DC orthodoxy on the Middle East. We should talk to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=431.04s)]
*  everybody there. But my concern is, is that if Trump's only aims are his personal enrichment, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=440.0s)]
*  and he doesn't get the guarantees for the Palestinians, then this is all for not. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=446.16s)]
*  Yeah, no, I absolutely agree with you on all those points. On the point of it's already corrupt, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=453.28s)]
*  on this show, we don't have to emphasize the role of APAC money and the national security [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=463.52s)]
*  establishment's investment in Israel. And in some ways, I think, who's that guy who's a big [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=468.88s)]
*  donor to Harvard who like, so Acme was basically complaining, like, you know, like, how are we [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=478.0s)]
*  allowing Qatar to put so much money into our system to like, you know, have an outsized voice [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=485.84s)]
*  in foreign policy? So that I mean, like Acme, that you're basically complaining that you're [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=492.16s)]
*  being outbid. That is exactly it. No, no, no. Yeah. So I think I said this to Skahill earlier [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=496.4s)]
*  in the week. You know, I think from Trump's perspective, and I want to give him too much [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=506.0s)]
*  credit, right? I mean, because this is, I don't think Trump has an ideology. I don't even think [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=511.12s)]
*  he has necessarily a foreign policy. I just don't even know that you could actually articulate it [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=516.8s)]
*  as a foreign policy. You don't make these 180 degree changes without informing anybody, you know, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=523.6s)]
*  whether, you know, the Houthis should be on a terrorist list or not, you know, to flip, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  you know, without telling anybody. He didn't tell the State Department. No, he didn't tell anybody. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So like, it's clearly not a foreign policy in the way that anyone really articulates a foreign [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=543.36s)]
*  policy. It really is just sort of, like you say, this is more like, you know, yeah, it's no more [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=550.64s)]
*  foreign policy than a mafia don. You have an urban plan, right? It's like, oh, we're going to [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=557.44s)]
*  build a building here because you guys paid for it. Yeah. Well, exactly. No, he is kind of, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=564.6400000000001s)]
*  I mean, okay, you have to kind of distinguish, I think maybe between Trump himself and the kind [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=571.84s)]
*  of like Republican Party, because I think that there is actually some interesting things going [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=576.4000000000001s)]
*  on, which I think people on the left are loathe to acknowledge, but are actually happening. But [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=580.48s)]
*  Trump himself exactly is a mafia boss. And he's actually, I mean, there's a very good article [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=585.12s)]
*  about how beloved he is in Saudi Arabia. And it's because he's the exact same guy as a Saudi [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=590.32s)]
*  princess. Like, you know, he's like totally transactional, non-ideological, just wants to [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=595.6s)]
*  be rich, loves gold, you know, a patriarchal, you know, all the same guy. So he's like, you know, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=600.4s)]
*  Trump is actually much more at home in Saudi Arabia or Qatar than he would be in Israel, right? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=610.4s)]
*  He's not like a settler type. He's like, show me the money guy. Having said that, I mean, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=616.32s)]
*  I think Emma was right. I want to actually underscore this point as well, because I mean, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=622.08s)]
*  for me, the bottom line, morally and beyond morally, I think for the sort of almost existential [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=627.28s)]
*  feature of humanity is the sort of Palestinian issue, you know, because if we allow like, you [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=634.56s)]
*  know, like a genocide, we're allowing a genocide to happen and that and Trump is continuing that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=639.5999999999999s)]
*  policy. Well, with the caveat that he said, they're actually much more critical of Netanyahu than [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  publicly critical than Netanyahu than Biden ever was willing to be. So, Wittkopf has basically [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=651.1199999999999s)]
*  said, like, you know, we want to make a deal with Hamas, but like the Israelis just want to have [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=657.76s)]
*  continued war and that they want to have like keep fighting in a way that doesn't make any sense to [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=661.6s)]
*  us because we don't actually see what the end game is. I mean, that's been true since October [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  2023. Wittkopf is the first American official to say that. Now, having said that, they continue to [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=672.32s)]
*  finance Israel. The killings are at a level as high as they've ever been. Yeah. So I mean, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=679.44s)]
*  I mean, the question is, how can we change that? What are the dynamics? The rift that's opening up [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=689.12s)]
*  between Netanyahu and Trump is small, but it's significant, right? Like it is something that's [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=695.04s)]
*  a little bit new. Well, let's play this clip. This is, see, I think this illustrates, this clip actually [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=701.2s)]
*  illustrates, he's in, I don't know, where was he? He was in Doha and the Emir of Qatar is standing [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=705.44s)]
*  next to him. And it's quite clear, like we only catch like the second half of the conversation. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=716.32s)]
*  There's sort of, you can tell by the handle, the beginning of Trump's sort of like statement here [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=721.6s)]
*  that it comes out of the conversation he just had with the Emir of Qatar. Here, let's play this. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=730.1600000000001s)]
*  We're going to handle a couple of situations that you have here with some very serious situations. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=736.8000000000001s)]
*  And we're looking at Gaza and we got to get that taken care of. A lot of people are [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=742.0s)]
*  starving. A lot of people are, there's a lot of bad things going on. We're going to handle. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=746.9599999999999s)]
*  So he's turning, he's looking at the Emir of Qatar and saying, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=750.9599999999999s)]
*  there's a lot of, there's a couple of things that we've got to handle. And then he turns to [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=757.8399999999999s)]
*  the audience and says, you know, there's the, and it's like, whatever the, you know. Well, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  whatever the last person that Trump talked to is who he goes by. I mean, he is really a goldfish. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=766.4s)]
*  But I think it's good to broaden up beyond Trump because there's within the Republican Party, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=774.0s)]
*  actual factions that have real serious differences on foreign policy. And this maybe gets at to why [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=778.4s)]
*  there might be a change, but it might also be sabotaged. Because there's like, there's an [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=784.8s)]
*  American first faction, which, you know, like our, you know, they're not like us. Like they, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=790.24s)]
*  they like wars that you win. And America hasn't been winning wars. They're very, you know, like [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=796.72s)]
*  they actually have turned against the forever wars. They don't want, they're people, you know, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=802.64s)]
*  they don't want to get into a war with Iran. A lot of that is because they want to actually [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  fight China, right? Like they want to, you know, husband the resources to fight China, whatever. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=810.5600000000001s)]
*  The fact is, but there's also a continued faction of neoconservatives that Trump himself continues [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=815.36s)]
*  to hire. Now, some of these people, because of the factional battle, he's fired, like walls he fired, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=821.6s)]
*  right? So a lot of this really depends, I think, on who's the last, who's around Trump, who he's [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=826.16s)]
*  listening to. And right now, it does seem like, you know, like some of the American first voices, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=831.2s)]
*  in addition to these Middle Eastern despots who are like willing to like, you know, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=837.76s)]
*  funnel huge amounts of money into Trump's pocket, they're giving him a counter point of view, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=843.12s)]
*  which considering the badness of American foreign policy, like, you know, like what they're actually [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=850.24s)]
*  pushing for is not that terrible compared to the status quo. I mean, I agree with that, but I think [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=855.2s)]
*  we find ourselves in a really different position because, you know, like as irrelevant as [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=864.88s)]
*  I generally feel in the context of any policy discussion, we, in particular, in this instance, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=874.08s)]
*  I feel like have no leverage. Like, like the, in the sense that, you know, I think like in the future, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=882.4s)]
*  we have leverage in terms of where Democrats are regarding Israel and requiring the question of [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=889.68s)]
*  Gaza and all these questions. But in the context of what Donald Trump does, we are so far removed [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=894.96s)]
*  from being part of whatever calculus he has as to getting to what he wants. You know, like, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=902.24s)]
*  we're not putting money into his pocket. You know, he's got a deal with Maryam Adelson, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=910.16s)]
*  and he's going to deliver for her. He's going to give them the West Bank and he's going to give them, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=915.12s)]
*  you know, and you get a bonus, just like I gave you, you know, whatever it was, the Golan Heights [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  last time you didn't even ask me. But on the other hand, I also just made a deal with the Amir, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=924.5600000000001s)]
*  and so we got to give food to, you know, the Gazans and, you know, Hamas can stay, but somebody else [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=932.08s)]
*  will be, you know, the president. I mean, that's the calculus. And there may be people who, you [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=939.76s)]
*  know, Laura Loomer can get in there, but I'm not prepared to do what Laura Loomer has done. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=946.4s)]
*  My most controversial take is, like, you know, like, you know, like if Laura Loomer is the person [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  that you need to take out the, you know, neoconservatives hawks out of Trump's inner [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=958.96s)]
*  circle, then, you know, like, you know, like Churchill said with Stalin, you know, like, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  if he's the guy that could defeat Hitler, you know. The difference is, is that, you know, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=968.48s)]
*  Churchill in the relationship between Churchill and Stalin different. Yeah, we're not in alliance [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=977.6800000000001s)]
*  with Laura Loomer, but I actually do think that in the context of, I mean, I think Trump actually [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=984.48s)]
*  does pay attention to American public opinion in a way that someone like Biden did not on foreign [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=988.72s)]
*  policy. And I actually think this is actually very important. Because he doesn't care. It's really [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=993.2s)]
*  just about the, it's, like I say, the calculation is maybe some element of public opinion, but the [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=996.4s)]
*  dollars, the dollars. Yeah, I don't know, the dollars are paramount, but I mean, I think Trump [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1004.4s)]
*  actually, it has been sensitive to the fact that a large part of the American public has been sickened [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1010.08s)]
*  by the forever wars and, you know, sickened by what America has done in the Middle East. And this [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1016.96s)]
*  includes like, you know, some fairly conservative people. The primary in 2016, he was going after [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1022.1600000000001s)]
*  Jeb Bush. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And there's actually pretty good kind of like social science [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1027.44s)]
*  data that the areas in like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin that Trump did the best on [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1032.0s)]
*  were the areas that had the highest military recruitment. That these were the areas where [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1039.2s)]
*  you had the most people that had been in deployment in the Middle East compared to elsewhere. So I [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1043.8400000000001s)]
*  actually do think that Trump's anti-war rhetoric, anti, like, you know, as cynical as it is, and, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1048.56s)]
*  you know, like as far as it is from what we want, it actually, he is actually sensitive to the fact [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1054.48s)]
*  that, you know, there's a large part of the American public that does not want a war with Iran, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1059.92s)]
*  right? And I actually think that this is the one small area where we do actually kind of have a [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1064.16s)]
*  role. Because if Trump sees that, you know, it's not just like the Laura Loomers of the world, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1069.6s)]
*  the Tucker Carlson's, but there's a broader public that's like, you know, hostile to the wars in [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1074.3999999999999s)]
*  Iran and, you know, like also concerned about like what's happening in Gaza. That actually does, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1078.8799999999999s)]
*  he's, I think, sensitive enough a politician about public opinion that he will respond to this. And [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1084.48s)]
*  I have to say, public opinion among Republicans is changing on Israel as well, especially under 50. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1090.1599999999999s)]
*  You look at like this poll, a good polling showing that like Republicans under 50, like, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1096.24s)]
*  you know, half of them are like hostile to Israel, right? 50%. Yeah, 50%. So I actually think that- [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1100.72s)]
*  Probably pretty anti-Semitic, but yeah. Well, there are, yeah, I mean, a lot of that is coming, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1106.8s)]
*  but that is the traditional Republican. I mean, you go back to like, you know, Bush Senior, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1110.0s)]
*  Nixon, Eisenhower- They don't vote for, yeah, Baker famously said they don't vote for us anyways. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1114.48s)]
*  They don't vote for us anyways. Yeah, and like as ugly as that is, like, you know, we have, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1119.1200000000001s)]
*  America has been supporting a genocide, you know, like, like the question is, how do we stop that? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1124.88s)]
*  How do we stop that? Yeah, I agree with you to an extent to where like, I guess I'm, I'm contradicting [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1129.8400000000001s)]
*  myself, but I'm saying there's a possibility here that perhaps he does have somewhat of an ideology [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1135.68s)]
*  that's in, we can look at the tariff policy and see maybe why he didn't go to Jerusalem in this [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1142.0s)]
*  last round in the Middle East. He just kind of, he spurned the Israelis, like he- [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1148.56s)]
*  But he's a national, he's American nationalist is my point in that he may be seeing like in the way [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1155.9199999999998s)]
*  that he talked about Ukraine and Zelensky ripping us off with all the money that they're taking from [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1160.96s)]
*  us. Do you think he's perhaps using some of that analysis with Israel? And he said, what have you [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1166.08s)]
*  done for me lately guy? Mary Madeleine donated to his campaign. Mary Madeleine didn't give him [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1172.08s)]
*  like a plane, a jet, oh, a jet plane for Mr. Trump. Like that is, I think that he's a, what have you [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1178.72s)]
*  done for me lately? And that's cash in his pocket, not cash in his campaign. Yeah, yeah, no, exactly. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1186.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, the amount of money that the air monarchies are putting into Trump's pocket, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1191.9199999999998s)]
*  like through AI and through other things. And it's the same people like Witkopf, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1197.44s)]
*  Witkopf's son is running Trump's crypto business. So basically, you know, like Mary Madeleine, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1201.2s)]
*  like, you know, like she's yesterday's news in a lot of ways. And then as rich as she is, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1209.8400000000001s)]
*  you know, she cannot outbid these like, you know, oil rich autocracies that have like [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1215.44s)]
*  trillions of dollars to throw around. And exactly Trump's analysis, it's both the nationalism [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1220.8s)]
*  and the mafia boss. I don't think those two things are different. And it is a case that [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1227.76s)]
*  Israel is a net loss for the United States, a net loss, certainly in terms of like, you know, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1232.0s)]
*  America is gives a lot of money to Israel, whereas like Saudi Arabia buys a lot of weapons, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1236.96s)]
*  like, just the profit. But beyond that, there's a net loss of, you know, like American perception [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1242.16s)]
*  of America in the world, which is a bit more amorphous. I think, you know, people are sensitive [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1249.04s)]
*  to the fact that, you know, like what Israel is doing is very unpopular. I would I don't think [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1253.36s)]
*  like this, you know, the Saudi Crown Prince cares at all about the Palestinians, but he knows his [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1259.4399999999998s)]
*  people care. And I think that all the other people in the Middle East know that, you know, they have [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1264.4799999999998s)]
*  to at least make a show of concern about this. They cannot normalize relationships with Israel [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1268.56s)]
*  while this is going on. So I think that that that gives a bit of leverage. And as I said, I think, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1273.04s)]
*  you know, to me, the real battleground is American public opinion, that if there's enough public [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1280.32s)]
*  anger and hostility towards Israel, not just among like, you know, like the left, you know, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1286.0s)]
*  but like sort of like middle America that shares this kind of perception, they're like, what the [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1291.28s)]
*  hell are we doing? Like, we're financing a genocide that is going to create levels of hatred for us, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1295.76s)]
*  like that the world has never seen. And what are we getting from this? And, you know, like that crude, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1302.72s)]
*  you know, transactional stuff, as bad as it is, and I have a lot of critiques of it, is better than, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1309.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, Biden's ideological Cold War fantasies and Zionism, right? Like, like, there's at least [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1316.32s)]
*  some possibility. But I want to say, going back to something Emma said, there's one proviso, which is, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1321.68s)]
*  I don't know if Grumkin pulled this off, because everything we've seen from his first term is that [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1327.76s)]
*  when push comes to shove, he doesn't have the tenacity, the knowledge, the, you know, you actually [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1333.2s)]
*  have to know what you're doing to change American foreign policy. You have to be like a Kissinger, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1339.28s)]
*  or even like an Obama with like, you know, the Iran nuclear deal and opening to Cuba, you have to [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1343.6000000000001s)]
*  have like a strength of character that challenge the bureaucracy, because there's a national security [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1348.0800000000002s)]
*  bureaucracy that's committed to war. And there's also like all these think tanks, and within the [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1352.64s)]
*  Republican Party. And my big worry is not so much, you know, Trump is going to have a corrupt foreign [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1358.24s)]
*  policy, because it's already corrupt. My big worry is that whatever positive he's going to be doing [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1363.36s)]
*  is going to be undermined by, you know, the fact that he has all these Republican appointees [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1367.76s)]
*  that are going to sabotage him as they did in his first term. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1372.4s)]
*  I think that to some extent, Project 2025 was geared towards inhibiting, I mean, and I think [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1375.68s)]
*  probably the blob, as it were, is probably the most entrenched, the national security is the [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1387.92s)]
*  most entrenched of non-loyalists, as it were. But I also think that like, really, it comes down to, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1394.64s)]
*  what is the ask? Like you say, Muhammad bin Salman doesn't need, doesn't care about the Palestinians, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1403.6000000000001s)]
*  but his people do. And there's a lot of leaders around the country, I mean, I should say around [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1413.04s)]
*  the region who are in a similar dynamic. And it really just comes down to, you know, how much do [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1418.3999999999999s)]
*  they need from Trump to justify recognizing Israel? And then when they do that, then it's just like, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1424.3999999999999s)]
*  money starts flowing, I am convinced in both directions, and I'm not even talking nationally, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1434.56s)]
*  I am talking like into Trump's friends and buddies, and that's it. And at the end of the day, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1439.76s)]
*  that to me seems to be going to be the determinant. He is not going to walk away from, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1447.6s)]
*  you know, a billion dollars that is going to go to his buddies or multiple billions of dollars that [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1454.16s)]
*  are going to be spread around, you know, Team Trump. Yeah, no, not to his buddies, his family. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1460.32s)]
*  It's time I mean, like the scale of the money of this crypto stuff is like unbelievable. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1465.04s)]
*  Like, it is like, you know, I mean, the only thing that crypto allows you to do is like, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1469.52s)]
*  you know, financial transactions that cannot be monitored. Right? This is like, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1474.08s)]
*  this is the value of it. And this is like, you know, like, it's not an accident that [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1480.08s)]
*  Witkoff's son, Zach Witkoff, you know, made the announcement at, I think it was Doho, that the, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1485.68s)]
*  you know, like of this big new deal, and that we're getting to see billions of dollars of [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1492.72s)]
*  Arab oil, Emirate money flowing into crypto to bolster, you know, almost directly to [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1499.68s)]
*  Trump family pockets and to Witkoff family pockets. So it is like openly corrupt. But [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1506.8s)]
*  having said that, like, when has, you know, like, the bottom line is American foreign policy in the [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1513.6s)]
*  Middle East has been terrible going back to Franklin Roosevelt. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1519.04s)]
*  Like you say, Biden had a was ideological in it. There's been others who, there's that without a [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1523.12s)]
*  doubt. It's all, you know, so much of our foreign policy is almost definitionally, whose resources [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1531.04s)]
*  are we going to extract for, you know, a certain class of people, etc, etc. But there were [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1536.32s)]
*  ideological constraints and more, it seems to me, more constraints by public opinion and sort of [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1543.04s)]
*  conventional wisdom and whatnot. And I think Trump had just at the end of the day, it's like, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1551.76s)]
*  if you hit my number, that's what it's about. Write the number on the paper. If the number looks [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1557.04s)]
*  good to me, we're going to make this happen. And that's it. And that's all he cares about. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1563.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Having said that, where does it leave, for me, the bottom line is where does it [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1568.3999999999999s)]
*  leave, you know, like the Palestinians? I don't know if the Arab Emirates are going to be the [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1573.52s)]
*  major determining factor. I actually think at the bottom of the day, like the determining factor [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1579.52s)]
*  that will ultimately restrain Israel is public opinion. And in the Middle East, because these [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1584.8s)]
*  are all dictatorships, that has a limit. But I don't think there's less, I think less of a limit [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1590.24s)]
*  in Europe and in America and, frankly, in a lot large parts of Asia. Like if Israel becomes, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1595.52s)]
*  like seen as a pariah state, that you cannot, yeah, that's where we're heading. That's where [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1601.84s)]
*  we're heading. And I think that's the only way out. That's the only way out of this. What I think is, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1607.12s)]
*  like, to me, the most evil thing that like the Western countries have been involved with [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1611.52s)]
*  in many decades, like going back at least to the Vietnam War, like it's just how do we get out of [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1617.92s)]
*  this hell? I'd put Iraq up there too. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1621.76s)]
*  but it is up there. It's up there. It's one of the top, you know, exactly. Yeah. And we don't have [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1628.4s)]
*  the true death toll in front of us. I mean, it's likely quadruple five times what's being on the [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1633.76s)]
*  page. I don't even say those numbers. And I would also say the amount of information that we have [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1639.2s)]
*  as a people is so much greater than it was during Iraq. Yeah. And, you know, because of social media [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1645.2s)]
*  and because of the nature of Palestine and all of that, it makes it that much more egregious [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1652.96s)]
*  in many respects. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a lot harder to deny the horrors that are going on [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1659.52s)]
*  there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And like I said, I don't have much hope for Trump. I actually think he's [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1667.52s)]
*  going to be like with the Iran deal, that you can already see like Rubio and others like putting in [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1672.32s)]
*  poison pills that are going to like make it impossible, even though Trump I think has the [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1678.3999999999999s)]
*  right ideas. And Trump doesn't have the character to like push something like that through, I think. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1682.6399999999999s)]
*  But having said that, to the extent that Trump is breaking down the consensus, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1689.76s)]
*  making it more possible for like politicians to criticize Israel, making it more possible for people [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1693.52s)]
*  to say like we should be talking to Iran, you know, we should be talking, you know, like, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1699.04s)]
*  we should try to make Syria a success, right? Like we should, why the hell are we bombing Yemen? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1703.44s)]
*  To the extent that Trump has like changed that, and these are all things that Biden was on the [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1708.8s)]
*  wrong side of. You know, like that's the net positive in a very bad, bad situation. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1712.96s)]
*  Take phone calls. You should check that out. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_DF402ez4&t=1729.04s)]
