# "Silence Wasn’t A Choice": Ms Rachel Attacked For Helping Kids In Gaza
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc)
*  Speaking of which, here is Miss Rachel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=0.0s)]
*  She is a kid's. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=5.0s)]
*  She's a huge deal. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=6.0s)]
*  I have two friends that have little babies and they all love Miss Rachel and even Francesca [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=8.0s)]
*  Fiorentini her kid obsessed with Miss Rachel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=13.84s)]
*  Mr. Rogers type character. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=17.12s)]
*  Basically, finally, we have like a real I feel like there was I mean, Sesame Street's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=19.92s)]
*  always held the line, but she's almost like an Instagram based Mr. Rogers type. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=24.04s)]
*  That's a good way to put it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=29.72s)]
*  But she had the audacity of like of being supportive of children in Gaza. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=30.84s)]
*  She's been recording videos specifically for them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=38.48s)]
*  And you see them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  It's obviously triggering because of all the anti-Semitism sitting amongst rubble, watching [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=42.96s)]
*  some of her videos, smiling for the first time in months, which has made people very [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  angry to see babies laugh. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=53.04s)]
*  She was on Maddie Hassan's show on Zateo just celebrating their one year anniversary. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=55.54s)]
*  Check them out. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=63.5s)]
*  You clearly love kids. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=64.5s)]
*  Is that why you decided to speak out about what's happening in Gaza specifically with [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=66.5s)]
*  children? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  I think it should be controversial to not say anything. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  Did you also like millions of other Americans just seeing these horrific, tragic videos? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=75.22s)]
*  The idea that caring for a group of children in an emergency situation means you don't [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=80.9s)]
*  care about other children is false. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=85.66s)]
*  Palestinian children less human than other children should we care less about them? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=87.46s)]
*  I don't quite get where the controversy is coming from. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=91.66s)]
*  It's sad that people try to make it controversial when you speak out for children that are facing [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=94.7s)]
*  a measurable suffering. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=100.38s)]
*  I'm sure you have a lot of good people in your lives who are saying to you, just be [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=101.7s)]
*  quiet. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=106.14s)]
*  It's not worth it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=107.14s)]
*  What do you say to them? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=108.14s)]
*  Our compassion doesn't have boundaries or borders. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=109.14s)]
*  We just love kids. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=112.38s)]
*  Why do you feel this urge to speak out for Sudanese kids and Haitian kids? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=113.86s)]
*  And right now, obviously, the kids who are suffering most in the world, the Gazan kids. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=118.66s)]
*  Silence wasn't a choice for me. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=122.9s)]
*  Virulent, virulent anti-Haitian face of hate. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=127.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=133.9s)]
*  She was targeted by, I guess it was the... [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=137.1s)]
*  What are we learning about those lists of folks, Matt? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=141.5s)]
*  The name of... [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  I'm forgetting. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  There's a canary mission that smears opponents of Israel as anti-Semites and B'Tar, the fascist [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  organization that Albert Einstein called brown shirts. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  Still, and they boast that proudly. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=156.73999999999998s)]
*  They say Einstein hated us. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  Aren't we cool? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=160.94s)]
*  They're helping give lists. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  They take meetings with like Fetterman and stuff like that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  Bish. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=165.94s)]
*  They take meetings with Fetterman. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=168.34s)]
*  That's... [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  It's moving in the hall. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=170.73999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they got to communicate with him on Twitter. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=172.34s)]
*  Just watch him. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=176.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=177.38s)]
*  Bring... [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=178.38s)]
*  Why does everybody hate me? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=179.38s)]
*  Senator, what are you doing? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=180.38s)]
*  They bring a laser pen. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=182.98s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=184.78s)]
*  Matt from PA. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  This weekend, I went to a Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs versus Worcester Red Sox minor league [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  game. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=193.98s)]
*  It's dubbed at the Majority Report game, given both Sam and Emma's respective connections [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=194.98s)]
*  to Worcester and Lehigh Valley. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=198.89999999999998s)]
*  I love... [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  I have a t-shirt from that minor league baseball game with just a big strip of bacon on it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  It's very silly, but yes, the Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=205.73999999999998s)]
*  I cannot tell you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=209.38s)]
*  I don't think there is a single entity or anything where I and my family own more merch [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=211.89999999999998s)]
*  than Worcester Red Sox. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=220.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=221.29999999999998s)]
*  Didn't you go back there and do a tour of the stadium? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  I did at one point. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=224.82s)]
*  That was like six years ago. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  There was some like homecoming Worcester thing and got to do a tour of the stadium when it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=228.54s)]
*  was empty. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=235.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it was definitely not six years ago because it happened while I was working here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  I think it was your reunion, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=238.94s)]
*  No, that was my high school reunion. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  Oh, nevermind. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  This I think was... [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  I feel like it was... [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=247.45999999999998s)]
*  Like in 22 maybe. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=248.45999999999998s)]
*  I don't know when it was. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=250.45999999999998s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=251.45999999999998s)]
*  It was... [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  The ballpark is awesome. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  Now there was some taxpayer dollars used for it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=256.66s)]
*  Not terribly excited about that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=259.1s)]
*  Somehow we can build those. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=262.26s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=264.26s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=265.26s)]
*  Wonder why those things go up. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=268.82s)]
*  Anyways, but Worcester Red Sox. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=271.22s)]
*  Love it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=274.66s)]
*  Trump says he's considering ways to serve a third term as president. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=275.66s)]
*  Every time we call out Trump's authoritarianism, the right calls it media hysteria. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=278.66s)]
*  But here's your reminder. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=283.06s)]
*  Trump is openly trying to defy the Constitution and run for a third term. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=284.62s)]
*  But if you don't know the bias behind your news, you might actually believe Trump's just [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=288.98s)]
*  teasing us. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  Go to ground.news slash majority to see how framing influences more than your perception. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=294.62s)]
*  Media bias is powerful enough to shape policy and yes, even Trump's ability to undermine [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=300.98s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=306.1s)]
*  That's why we've partnered with Ground News for years now. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=307.74s)]
*  Their app and website breaks down how the most critical issues we're facing are being [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=311.14s)]
*  spun. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=315.53999999999996s)]
*  By exposing each reporting source's hidden agendas, I can see the world as it is, not [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=316.53999999999996s)]
*  as their biases want me to. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=321.3s)]
*  Even better, if I'm ever reading about an issue on another site, their browser extension [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=323.7s)]
*  flags the source's political bias and instantly leaks me to other reports so I can verify [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=328.18s)]
*  the information. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=333.78s)]
*  They're not some new tool I needed to learn. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=335.2s)]
*  Ground News is a better version of the doom scrolling we're already doing. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=337.42s)]
*  And after reading your comments, it's clear you'd benefit from them too. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=341.26s)]
*  I got my viewers 40% off the same unlimited access vantage plan that I've been using that's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=344.94s)]
*  just $5 a month for clarity and context when you go to ground.news slash majority or scan [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6e3oXVWUYc&t=350.42s)]
