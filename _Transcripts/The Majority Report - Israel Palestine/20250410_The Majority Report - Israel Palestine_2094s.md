# Tim Pool Says US Support For Israel Will Expire In 10-20 Years
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw)
*  Tim Poole revealed something that I'm not necessarily sure a lot of people were aware of, which is that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=0.0s)]
*  he was about to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu, and he did. Didn't apparently go as planned, but I guess he brought up [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=7.5s)]
*  Israel to Benjamin Netanyahu. I would love to have been a fly on the wall in this meeting, frankly. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  But here he is explaining it to his audience, being fully transparent about this meeting with the man who's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=23.12s)]
*  committing genocide right now. Being fully transparent after, we should be clear, being fully transparent [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=29.099999999999998s)]
*  after news of it already leaked and it was published in an article [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=35.58s)]
*  where his name was included in the list of influencers who met with Netanyahu. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=40.78s)]
*  I was being facetious, but I appreciate that clarification. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=45.3s)]
*  I had a feeling, but I wanted to make it completely clear. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=48.62s)]
*  My having left this meeting is they are clueless to the issue. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=52.86s)]
*  They don't know, despite the fact there was literally a protest outside. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=57.059999999999995s)]
*  They were dismissive of. They say these things happen. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=61.22s)]
*  The trends that I see are younger people are increasingly anti-Israel and on the right, they're relatively neutral or don't care. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=65.1s)]
*  My prediction, as I made over a year ago, is that with the anti-war elements of the populist movement on the right [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=74.58s)]
*  and the anti-Israel section of the left, not to mention there is a smaller but still prominent anti-Israel right, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=81.34s)]
*  Israel is not going to have support from this country in 20 years. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=88.74s)]
*  The U.S. is going to say we've got two factions, young people on the right who are following the footsteps of MAGA [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=91.66s)]
*  populist movement who don't want to fund foreign wars. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=97.22s)]
*  They vote no on Israel. The far left that hates Israel, they vote no on Israel. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=99.82s)]
*  Israel, you get no funding anymore. That's what I see happening. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=103.82s)]
*  I think that's fairly obvious when you talk to any Zoomers. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=106.78s)]
*  They're clearly not pro-Israel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=110.86s)]
*  They look at the United States and say, we have our own problems here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=114.02000000000001s)]
*  And they look at our history of foreign adventurism and they're like, this hasn't worked out for me personally. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=117.34s)]
*  I can't afford this. I can't pay bills or I can't have a nice place or whatever. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=123.54s)]
*  So I think it's fairly obvious, right? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=128.38s)]
*  I think it comes from a lack of education on how foreign policy actually works and the fact that you literally cannot [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=130.70000000000002s)]
*  survive in this world without allies. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=138.26000000000002s)]
*  Ten guys show up to beat you up. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=142.3s)]
*  Are you going to fight them all by yourself? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=143.94s)]
*  No, you need friends. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=145.34s)]
*  What's that? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=146.78s)]
*  What? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=147.22s)]
*  I said Phil might. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=147.5s)]
*  Phil might. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  But you see this from people in Congress too. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  They just don't understand how foreign policy works. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=152.22s)]
*  I think it's really unfortunate. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  But the other issue to what you're talking about with the lack of. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=155.34s)]
*  Sorry, we just need to go back to this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=159.3s)]
*  We need to be so sophisticated and the way we get sophisticated isn't like, oh, you know, I thought he was going to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=164.18s)]
*  mention maybe like trade routes or something like that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=169.1s)]
*  But it was, imagine you're going to get beat up and you don't have a crew behind you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=172.46s)]
*  You need friends. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=176.86s)]
*  I mean, it's a little. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=178.3s)]
*  Is this the sophistication? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=179.02s)]
*  But we're not talking about Israel. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=180.78s)]
*  These guys are all about isolationism and America number one. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=183.46s)]
*  We don't need anybody else and they should be groveling at our feet coming to us. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=186.66000000000003s)]
*  You don't know how foreign policy works. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=190.82000000000002s)]
*  I don't. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  I guess. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=192.9s)]
*  I don't know who I know. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=195.46s)]
*  I know who Tim Pool is. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=197.02s)]
*  I know who Phil from all that remains is. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=198.3s)]
*  And I know who I don't know who the other guy is, but I'd like to know what that other guy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=201.62s)]
*  I don't know who that is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=207.34s)]
*  That name sounds familiar, but I would love to know his opinion on our support for Ukraine, because I know what Tim Pool [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=209.06s)]
*  and likely Phil's opinion on that is. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=215.94s)]
*  It's probably a bit different than we got to support Israel because we need allies. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=220.5s)]
*  It's more probably like Ukraine needs to be groveling at our feet enough and funding of Ukraine. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=225.5s)]
*  I'd love to know what these guys feel about that one. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=231.62s)]
*  Well, I mean, yeah, go ahead. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=234.46s)]
*  In that sense, they're just mirroring like the average Republican politician's viewpoint on the issue, which is to speak a lot about isolationism, a lot about [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=236.9s)]
*  not funding foreign wars and spending that money at home, because that was mainstreamed in the Republican Party, largely by Trump in 2016. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=245.7s)]
*  Like he was one of the first people to start really speaking to the sham of the Iraq War from the Republican side. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=253.17999999999998s)]
*  And that opened the floodgates for a lot of sentiment that people were feeling, which is that like, you know, how come we're spending all this money overseas? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=260.46s)]
*  And the roads outside my home look like garbage. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=267.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=270.82s)]
*  And the right wing has used that wedge to further their neo-fascist aims, but they want you to carve out an exemption for Israel that doesn't make sense in their ostensible [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=271.46s)]
*  like worldview, but makes sense when you understand that like the Democrats, they're taking large amounts of money from military industrial contractors and the military complex in the form of APAC money. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=282.02s)]
*  And they set the stage for this particular situation where not just the left, but the right is becoming less than ever with Israel. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=293.78s)]
*  I think there's probably less popularity with evangelical Christianity amongst younger right wingers, even, you know, evangelical Christianity is kind of like outmoded. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=301.21999999999997s)]
*  And that's like the biggest source of Christian Zionism in America. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=308.85999999999996s)]
*  And then also, like the thing that Temple wasn't saying is that a lot of his ideas give rise or like lead people down the pathway towards just outright anti-Semitism on the right. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=312.61999999999995s)]
*  And a lot of those anti-Semites aren't Christian Zionists, anti-Semites. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=322.66s)]
*  And when they're not Christian anti-Semites, I mean, Christian Zionists, anti-Semites, they tend to be anti-Israel, just like outright neo-Nazi adjacent anti-Semites like Nick Fuentes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=325.62s)]
*  And, you know, we've seen his tensions with Fuentes too. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=335.78s)]
*  So he doesn't want to acknowledge that shows like his are like a stepping stone towards shows like Nick's, which is also making people anti-Israel. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=338.14s)]
*  Like he plays a role in this. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=345.14s)]
*  Not that I'm mad he's making people anti-Israel, but like on the right, it's not like they're moving towards better things. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=346.38s)]
*  They're moving towards like neo-Naziism and then isolationism. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=351.58000000000004s)]
*  You said so much right there, but that is a huge part of it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=355.66s)]
*  One, we showed this graph earlier that, yes, they're correct. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=358.86s)]
*  That anti-Israel sentiment is on the rise. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=361.98s)]
*  It's now a majority opinion, according to Pew. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=364.94s)]
*  Fifty three percent of U.S. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=368.02000000000004s)]
*  adults have a negative view of Israel. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=369.22s)]
*  The increase of Republicans age 18 to 49 is now it's at 50 percent of the in that demographic. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=371.34000000000003s)]
*  35 to 50 it moved since 2022. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=379.62s)]
*  Fifteen point increase in negative views for Israel for that age group of Republicans. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=382.26s)]
*  And then you see how it's barely moved at all if you're an older Republican, just to balance that out. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=388.1s)]
*  But the biggest cycles in the world, frankly, 50 plus Republicans. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=393.82s)]
*  But look at how much even the 50 plus Democrats. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=397.74s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=400.7s)]
*  Forty three to 66. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=401.54s)]
*  Two thirds Democrats have negative views of Israel. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=403.18s)]
*  Two thirds of Democrats over over 50. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=405.98s)]
*  And it's higher among Democrats at all. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=408.78s)]
*  Right. Like good on the Democrats 18 to 49 that were already 62 percent before that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=411.29999999999995s)]
*  But 71 now. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=416.34s)]
*  I mean, and this is a party led by two folks, one who explicitly said, my job is to keep Democrats pro Israel. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=418.14s)]
*  Yeah. Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who's in bed with APAC as well. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=424.09999999999997s)]
*  And yeah, they're so bad. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=427.97999999999996s)]
*  They can't even do that right. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=429.65999999999997s)]
*  They can't. And I made this point earlier with Prem talker. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=431.41999999999996s)]
*  If the Democrats are all in on popularism, like my Adeglacius is wants them to be back on, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  just follow what the polls say is popular. Here you go. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=439.82s)]
*  Here's a gimme. But they're not interested in that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=442.7s)]
*  And I also love how Tim Pool like represents the right's opinion on this with isolationism. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=444.73999999999995s)]
*  But the left is anti Israel for, I don't know, whatever reasons. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=450.58s)]
*  He doesn't address that. He also had Nick Fuentes and Kanye West on his show, who are virulent anti Semites. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=454.29999999999995s)]
*  And you have Candace Owens, also anti Semitic, who's peddling this kind of stuff to the base. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=459.90000000000003s)]
*  Or at least he didn't address it right there. But he might later. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=466.18s)]
*  OK, well, I'm not. But Netanyahu was more than willing to meet with him. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=470.14s)]
*  And apparently, Dave Rubin, according to Jewish Insider, who reported on this, that was a part of this this meeting, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=473.5s)]
*  because what people need to understand is that Israel likes anti Semites because the more anti Semitism that they engender, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=479.3s)]
*  the more people, the more they feel, more justification that they can say, this is why we need an ethno state. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=486.86s)]
*  This is why we need to keep the hordes of of Arab people out of our state. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=492.3s)]
*  We need to maintain this demographic majority. They benefit from that kind of thing. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=496.06s)]
*  If there's no anti Semitism, there's no reason for Israel to exist. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=499.94s)]
*  Let's just play a little bit more of this and then we can find some other stuff. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=503.5s)]
*  Gen Z support for Israel. Is there are no like pro Israel champions that I really see? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=506.5s)]
*  I talk about Israel a lot. I'm a raging Zionist, but I don't see a whole lot of other people who have like [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=511.46s)]
*  a firm understanding of the history and the context. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=516.18s)]
*  No, we can't make a cogent argument that the young people find compelling as to why we should, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=518.3399999999999s)]
*  which is why on the right, it's sure Israel can do its thing, don't care. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=524.62s)]
*  And on the left, it's down with Israel. So I actually is a question for you guys. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=528.42s)]
*  Can you on this question? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=532.3s)]
*  This is not a gotcha because I'm asking for I'm looking for a real answer. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=533.8599999999999s)]
*  And for those that are listening comments, can you name a prominent, high profile, large following? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=536.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm talking like a podcast with millions of listeners who is staunchly pro Israel, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=541.5799999999999s)]
*  advocating very heavily for Israel. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=546.06s)]
*  Then you can use Gen Z. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=547.54s)]
*  No, anybody in the podcast space. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=549.62s)]
*  Dennis Prager, like like. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=551.3399999999999s)]
*  Sorry, anyone in the IDW, like the Weinstein brothers, like, what are you talking about? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=553.14s)]
*  Who? Barry Weiss, Ben Shapiro, Barry Weiss, every cable anchor, Jake Tapper, Dan Abash, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=558.98s)]
*  except like some on MSNBC. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=565.38s)]
*  Tim Poole, I would have put that in. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=568.5s)]
*  I mean, we'll get into some of that a little bit later. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=570.3s)]
*  But I will say they abandon like the previous point, which was like, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=571.9799999999999s)]
*  can you give a good reason why people should? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=576.26s)]
*  He made the only reason that he gave was like Matt said previously, was that like, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=578.8599999999999s)]
*  oh, it's like a lazy analogy to like a fistfight, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=583.5799999999999s)]
*  like being jumped outside of like the local saloon, I guess, an old Western or whatever. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=588.06s)]
*  And then they kind of revisited that like, hey, like, well, like, why shouldn't like [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=593.06s)]
*  why should Gen Zers be on board with Israel with all the things we just mentioned? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=596.6999999999999s)]
*  And then they were just like, well, who are the Gen Z far right [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=600.14s)]
*  influencers who would get them on board? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=603.14s)]
*  Not like addressing the central premise of like, why would you be? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=604.94s)]
*  And they didn't even they were looking for a Gen Z name. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=608.74s)]
*  They're just like, is there anyone that's pro Israel? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=611.3000000000001s)]
*  It's like, what are you? Are you out of your mind? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=613.9s)]
*  There's a few people, but they're going insane. Yeah. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=615.66s)]
*  And what Matt was looking up earlier was because I saw this. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=617.9s)]
*  It reminded me of this part of my conversation with Tim Poole from [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=621.74s)]
*  nearly two years ago at this point, where [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=627.22s)]
*  that very tension that you describe here, Binder, came up about their [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=630.82s)]
*  vehement opposition to the support for Ukraine. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=636.26s)]
*  But and how like if their isolationist, that should also extend to Israel. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=639.0600000000001s)]
*  This is that exchange. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=643.86s)]
*  Also, unclear to me of Higby himself is pro Ukraine. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=645.1s)]
*  He might be like the Douglas Murray type. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=647.78s)]
*  So I just want to put that in line, right? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=649.26s)]
*  Where Palestinians are defending themselves and then it's oh, my gosh, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=651.14s)]
*  they are just it's completely symmetrical. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=655.78s)]
*  Israel and Palestine, these are two actors just battling it out. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=659.02s)]
*  No one. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=662.0600000000001s)]
*  I would love to fund Palestinians so that they were able to have a better life. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=663.6600000000001s)]
*  The right of me on foreign policy. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=667.38s)]
*  Well, we already fund Israel, dude. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=668.86s)]
*  Yeah. Are you against that? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=670.74s)]
*  That's a tough question. I have an answer to. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=672.5s)]
*  You're in favor of funding military. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=674.5400000000001s)]
*  We fund the iron. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=677.0600000000001s)]
*  Literally saying, I'm a military industrial complex. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=677.98s)]
*  Anything enough about it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=681.02s)]
*  Then if I leave against and you're anti-war, then you should be saying [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=682.38s)]
*  that we should cut Israel funding for Israel. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=685.7800000000001s)]
*  And say, so right now I lean. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=687.86s)]
*  I said that's what I said. 99 percent. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=690.0200000000001s)]
*  I'll say I absolutely lean against providing military aid to Israel. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=691.1400000000001s)]
*  I just don't know. I will say. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=694.94s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=698.7800000000001s)]
*  But can we well, let's get back to, I guess, the this part, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=700.7s)]
*  because there's a point where he tries to blame some of the anti-Israel sentiment [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=704.4200000000001s)]
*  on funding, right? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=709.5s)]
*  Is that a part of this where he says the Qatari op part? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=711.0600000000001s)]
*  I was just reading that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=714.5s)]
*  It might be the beginning. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=716.1800000000001s)]
*  We don't need to get to it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=717.26s)]
*  But according to Jewish insider who wrote up this this article, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=718.26s)]
*  pool argued that there is a Qatari op to manipulate social media algorithms [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=723.58s)]
*  to make anti-Semitic and anti-Israel episodes appear to receive far more views [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=727.38s)]
*  than say tips for picking up women in order to incentivize podcasters [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=731.06s)]
*  and YouTubers to produce more anti-Semitic content. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=735.26s)]
*  Netanyahu, however, was noncommittal in his response, saying only that it's possible. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=739.98s)]
*  No, part of why those videos are doing well is because they are some of the most [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=745.7s)]
*  horrific images that you will ever see in your life. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=750.42s)]
*  Bones and flesh just like in piles because people can't identify [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=753.86s)]
*  the level of slaughter. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=760.14s)]
*  Children with their heads blown off, fathers wailing over the carcass of their toddler. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=761.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's why people are clicking on those things because they are [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=767.94s)]
*  inflammatory, but because of the violence that's being inflicted upon these people [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=772.26s)]
*  in this genocide. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=775.9799999999999s)]
*  It's just another I got actually a bunch of clips here, but here's just a little bit [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=777.02s)]
*  earlier from this in the same section, Tim, laid it out a little bit more. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=779.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's not I wasn't here. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=783.4599999999999s)]
*  I got late word that I was invited to a private roundtable meeting [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=785.9s)]
*  with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=792.38s)]
*  And I didn't remember that invite. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=795.9s)]
*  No, I did not get that. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=798.62s)]
*  And I just want to alert, remind people that Tim was caught [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=801.8199999999999s)]
*  or sorry, victimized, getting millions and millions of dollars [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=807.54s)]
*  from the Russian government that he now thinks that might be a lie. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=810.5s)]
*  He's sort of denying that. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=814.3s)]
*  OK, well, of course, we know it's not in court documents is pretty clear. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=815.66s)]
*  That was that broke after when I had that conversation with him. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=820.38s)]
*  That was June 20, 23. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=823.4599999999999s)]
*  So prior to October 7th, he didn't know anything about Israel at that time, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=825.4599999999999s)]
*  but was very anti-Ukraine. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=829.5799999999999s)]
*  We find out later that he was taking Russian money. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=830.94s)]
*  I wonder if his position on Israel is influenced by anything at all. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=833.82s)]
*  I mean, he did just meet with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=837.46s)]
*  That seems curious to me. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=839.1800000000001s)]
*  It seems he had his contact information. Yeah. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=840.0200000000001s)]
*  But what's called Chatham House rules, for those that are not familiar, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=843.1s)]
*  this means that you cannot reveal anybody who attended [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=845.94s)]
*  nor attribute anything to any one individual as they can deny it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=849.3800000000001s)]
*  And they and they would. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=853.2600000000001s)]
*  However, what I love about what the White House is currently doing, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=854.86s)]
*  when you bring together a bunch of influencers and podcasters [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=858.0200000000001s)]
*  who don't know much about journalism, culture, whatever you want to call it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=860.58s)]
*  Not that we respect it tremendously. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=864.94s)]
*  Most people didn't know what Chatham House meant. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=866.58s)]
*  So again, don't need to take it off the screen. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=868.74s)]
*  Just a reminder, we just played a clip of saying him saying, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=871.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't know much about it. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=873.5s)]
*  There are the recipient of our top military amount of military aid. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=875.5400000000001s)]
*  Israel. Funny, because they bring us into the Blair House, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=879.58s)]
*  which is where Netanyahu was staying. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=883.0200000000001s)]
*  And immediately people are walking out their cameras, their phones up. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=884.46s)]
*  They actually took our phones from us. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=887.74s)]
*  And I legit thought they would maintain Chatham House rules, meaning [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=889.62s)]
*  you can't quote the prime minister, you can't quote his officials [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=894.74s)]
*  and the other people who are there. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=897.38s)]
*  But you can report what was said generally. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=898.74s)]
*  If you wanted an official quote on a specific matter, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=901.78s)]
*  you would then ask an official once the meeting was wrapped [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=904.54s)]
*  and they provide you the exact quote, or they would just say outright, like [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=906.7s)]
*  we have put our quotes on that one. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=909.78s)]
*  The Chatham House rule, so he's a cute accusing the fact that Jewish [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=912.62s)]
*  insider had got leaks about what was said in this meeting of violating [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=915.54s)]
*  Chatham House rules. I'm sorry. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=920.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to think of how he would react if like, I don't know, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=921.42s)]
*  some journalist was like, yeah, Chatham House rules. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=924.62s)]
*  I didn't report that. Who cares? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=926.3s)]
*  What are you talking about? Chatham House rules. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=927.86s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I don't know what that is either. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=929.0999999999999s)]
*  Sounds like he's a little mad it got out. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=930.66s)]
*  But what's funny to me is Tim Poole, like obviously there's a video of you saying, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=932.42s)]
*  hey, do you want to fund Israel? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=938.3s)]
*  And I just put forward my credibility as I'm very anti-war, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=939.3s)]
*  but I haven't considered whether we should be sending arms to Israel. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=943.98s)]
*  I'll have to get back to you on that. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=947.74s)]
*  There's a couple of instances if you search because Tim put up this tweet, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=949.74s)]
*  which was Israel Derangement Syndrome. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=953.94s)]
*  Yeah. And he just put that up. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=958.82s)]
*  Israel Defense Syndrome over here. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=962.58s)]
*  Sorry, you know, Israeli Defense Syndrome. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=965.58s)]
*  Oh, there we got it. No. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=967.86s)]
*  No, no, no, it's all right. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=970.7s)]
*  We're still working on this. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=972.58s)]
*  No, no, OK, but either way. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=974.22s)]
*  But Tim Poole himself has [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=977.7s)]
*  I go back Israel USS Liberty Derangement Syndrome, which is anytime [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=981.3000000000001s)]
*  one of his co-host brings up the USS Liberty, which was when Israel bombed [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=986.7s)]
*  an American ship in 1967, Tim Poole loses his mind here. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=991.22s)]
*  Go wide shot, Russ. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=996.6600000000001s)]
*  Why? Why does he? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=998.82s)]
*  This is the first I've heard the USS Liberty that you mentioned earlier. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=999.86s)]
*  Oh, God, no, don't even do it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1002.22s)]
*  1967 during the Israeli Six Day War, they accidentally torpedoed or they shot down. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1003.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but depending on who you ask, it's not an accident. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1009.58s)]
*  That's like a whole can of worms. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1011.46s)]
*  Why are Jewish? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1013.02s)]
*  Let's let's let's let's jump to this next story. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1014.4200000000001s)]
*  OK, there's one there and I got another one here, actually, too. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1017.46s)]
*  And we'll get into the what what what actually happened there. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1022.38s)]
*  He wants to move on so quickly and also was meeting with Netanyahu [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1026.1000000000001s)]
*  and has previously taken money from foreign governments that [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1030.58s)]
*  can ported with his coverage. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1034.7s)]
*  Isn't this a sort of like, you know, thing independent media [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1035.86s)]
*  should not be unafraid to talk about? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1038.42s)]
*  And this was another one that posted by Halal flow. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1040.3799999999999s)]
*  Dude, I'm concerned with having American aircraft carriers over there. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1043.7s)]
*  Like I keep being told about the USS Liberty. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1047.02s)]
*  That's something with the Israeli government. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1049.22s)]
*  Yeah, you should. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1052.1s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1053.7s)]
*  You should be careful about that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1056.1399999999999s)]
*  Allegedly, the Israeli Air Force jet fighter aircraft. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1057.94s)]
*  I mean, they did end up paying out the American government. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1061.42s)]
*  So I'm concerned like false flag operation, like a missile comes out of Gaza. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1064.22s)]
*  Oh, no, it's one of our aircraft carriers, but it was actually Israeli missile. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1067.66s)]
*  Well, I don't want we should get out of there. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1070.8200000000002s)]
*  It doesn't let me stop you there. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1072.7s)]
*  It doesn't matter where the missile comes from. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1074.9s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1077.8200000000002s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1083.22s)]
*  I think that was Halal flow with that there. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1085.26s)]
*  But yeah, 1967, this is Ilan PappÃ©'s most recent book. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1088.1799999999998s)]
*  Actually, might not even be the most recent one. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1093.02s)]
*  One of his recent books, Lobby and on both sides of the Atlantic, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1094.4599999999998s)]
*  the carte blanche had limits which were breached when the Israeli Air Force [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1099.1799999999998s)]
*  bombed an American spy ship called Liberty, killing 34 Navy personnel [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1102.62s)]
*  and wounding more than 100. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1105.6999999999998s)]
*  Israel apologized, explained it was as a case of mistaken identity, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1106.82s)]
*  scarcely plausible given that the straight star spangled banner [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1110.54s)]
*  flew high on the deck. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1114.26s)]
*  APEC realized that it could not prevent President Johnson [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1115.5s)]
*  from admonishing Israel in public for assaulting the ship. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1117.58s)]
*  All it could do was damage control, as it was clear that even the usually [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1120.3s)]
*  pro-Israel mainstream media would find it hard to swallow the Israeli explanation. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1124.18s)]
*  Israel's reasons for attacking the ship are still debated today. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1128.14s)]
*  It probably had to do with information the spy ship was able to collect [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1130.98s)]
*  that might have tarnished Israel's international reputation. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1133.74s)]
*  Most scholars assume that the ship had gathered intelligence about an Israeli [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1136.66s)]
*  massacre of Egyptian soldiers, Israeli massacres, a thing that they [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1140.02s)]
*  do a lot of Egyptian soldiers and about the expulsion of Palestinians [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1144.1399999999999s)]
*  from the Gaza Strip, which Israel wanted to conceal. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1150.1s)]
*  But we still need further substantiation of this reason. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1153.4199999999998s)]
*  And the most important task for APEC was to dissuade members of Congress [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1156.5s)]
*  who wanted an official inquiry for making this demand a goal they achieved. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1160.06s)]
*  So the reason we don't know and why destiny can say like, oh, actually, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1163.74s)]
*  that's anti-Israel people, like even they go crazy with it. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1167.2199999999998s)]
*  The reason we don't know is because of the Israel lobby. Right. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1170.74s)]
*  It's a he says it's a Jewish thing. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1173.3s)]
*  No, it's actually a U.S. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1174.8999999999999s)]
*  national security like military industrial complex, deep state. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1176.3799999999999s)]
*  Who Tim Poole met with? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1180.86s)]
*  That's the that's the reason we don't know the answer to who shot that ship [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1182.34s)]
*  in the fucking Mediterranean. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1186.1399999999999s)]
*  And I will I'm opening it up in just a sec, but I just want to make this one point [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1187.62s)]
*  before I forget. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1190.82s)]
*  And I did just forget. OK, keep going. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1193.6599999999999s)]
*  I had it. I had it. Go ahead, Brandon. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1195.58s)]
*  Well, I was just going to say, I think, you know, he tried to make it [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1197.6599999999999s)]
*  seem like he's upset about both sides, like anti-Israel sentiment on the left, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1200.94s)]
*  anti-sentiment, Israel, something on the right. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1205.5400000000002s)]
*  But I think this is mostly about what's going on in his own space, like the right. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1207.74s)]
*  And how many people like Candace Owens have shifted away from, you know, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1211.9s)]
*  what was apparently the right wing status quo position on Israel to carve out [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1216.9s)]
*  themselves, parts of these audiences who are getting more and more explicitly [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1221.46s)]
*  anti-Semitic as they fall further and further down these rabbit holes. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1225.46s)]
*  Like you mentioned, he drew this dichotomy between like videos about [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1228.94s)]
*  picking up women in videos about like anti-Israel or anti-Semitic sentiment [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1233.38s)]
*  on the right. But in my mind, those two things are linked because you start out [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1237.7s)]
*  on that pipeline, looking at those like those like pick up artist type videos, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1241.9s)]
*  those kinds of like in cell adjacent videos. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1246.54s)]
*  And it's only a hop, skip it or jump away from like, well, actually, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1249.26s)]
*  Jewish people are the ones who are fomenting feminism in like [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1252.14s)]
*  Western society to like weaken the social fabric of our society to make it easier [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1256.6599999999999s)]
*  to take over. Like they're producing that content and they're starting themselves [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1261.9399999999998s)]
*  starting their viewers on the first step down that path and then getting [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1266.3s)]
*  frustrated when they move past them and they're getting frustrated when they move [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1269.6999999999998s)]
*  further to their right. And when he posted about that meeting, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1273.3s)]
*  it's not that people with like Palestinian flags were yelling at him. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1276.1s)]
*  They got him upset because he's used to that. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1279.1s)]
*  It was people with names like Red Pill Central and like, you know, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1280.58s)]
*  the suave groper that was the ad that was yelling at him in his mentions. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1284.34s)]
*  I don't know if that's a real person. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1290.7s)]
*  But, you know, it sounds like it could be, though. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1292.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's who's bad. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1295.3799999999999s)]
*  People, people in his mentions yelling for him to debate Nick Fuentes about Israel. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1296.74s)]
*  Like he doesn't like having to feel those things from the right because like, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1300.94s)]
*  you know, people just find that it's an insult to their [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1305.02s)]
*  political ideology if you question them from like further to the position they are. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1309.54s)]
*  Yeah. And what I was want I just remembered what I wanted to say about this. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1314.42s)]
*  I think that's a great point. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1319.14s)]
*  The right wing media space has very little respect for their audience. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1320.5s)]
*  I think they can keep feeding them slop and control what how they react. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1324.02s)]
*  But right now, like we had a caller yesterday who said that her brother [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1327.9s)]
*  has moved from being extremely pro-Israel to being really anti-Semitic [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1331.94s)]
*  and reading Hitler. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1336.34s)]
*  And I would not be shocked if these are the kinds of people that listen to Tim [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1337.42s)]
*  Poole. But you got to ask questions about why Tim Poole is meeting [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1340.54s)]
*  with a top world leader, again, the Hitler of our time currently committing genocide [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1345.26s)]
*  on and I guess revealing it. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1351.54s)]
*  But it reminds me of Joe Rogan, where he has all of these deep state people on [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1354.18s)]
*  or he has his tech oligarchs on his favorite to launder their PR, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1359.46s)]
*  which really kind of benefits the corporate network state [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1365.06s)]
*  that Donald Trump is trying to build. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1369.34s)]
*  Rogan claims to engage in conspiracism and bring that to his audience. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1371.54s)]
*  But a lot of the people he's been having on recently over the past few years [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1377.1399999999999s)]
*  are directly the subjects of of the of the deep state or part of the deep state [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1381.02s)]
*  or whatever that would be engaging in those conspiracies. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1387.1s)]
*  And so I do find it interesting that Tim Poole is kind of in that same vein right now. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1390.06s)]
*  I know there's this clip from Elephant Graveyard. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1397.38s)]
*  Oh, yes. This is a elephant graveyard is a great YouTube channel. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1401.3000000000002s)]
*  He did a video called I read how the how comedy became a dystopian [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1404.8600000000001s)]
*  imperial hell world. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1409.9s)]
*  And this just drives that point quickly about the nature of Joe Rogan guests. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1410.8600000000001s)]
*  And it slides in perfectly with Tim Poole sort of pretensions [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1414.98s)]
*  towards being independent, but constantly getting money from governments [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1419.8200000000002s)]
*  like Russia and, you know, I guess the media [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1423.58s)]
*  powwows with Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1427.62s)]
*  I would have been like them if I didn't have the access [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1430.6999999999998s)]
*  to the kind of conversations that I've had, if I didn't have the kind of mindset [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1434.22s)]
*  that I have, the mindset that my personality personality is just immune to bullshit. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1437.5s)]
*  Got it all. When bullshit hits me, I'm go, oh, I know what this is. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1442.62s)]
*  I grew up without a dad. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1446.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't trust people. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1448.1799999999998s)]
*  And the people that haven't experienced that, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1449.6999999999998s)]
*  I can understand why they formed the conclusions that they did, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1452.3s)]
*  because I could have been them. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1455.2199999999998s)]
*  I 100 percent could have been them. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1456.5s)]
*  Well, thank God Joe's mommy bought hamburger that fateful night. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1458.54s)]
*  Or Joe could have ended up a guy with the biggest mainstream media platform on Earth, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1461.4599999999998s)]
*  being easily used and exploited by weird billionaires and grifters [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1465.06s)]
*  and allowing it to happen because he's just so desperate for love and validation [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1468.26s)]
*  on account of that dad hole. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1472.1399999999999s)]
*  It's crazy to think there's a multiverse thing out there [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1473.62s)]
*  where the number one comedy podcast doesn't have guests like some comic book, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1475.86s)]
*  villain, evil, rich guy, all these nut job billionaire dweebs. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1479.54s)]
*  And like, I don't know, a guy literally from the CIA. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1482.8999999999999s)]
*  It's unlike once a month for some reason. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1486.06s)]
*  And also like the entire government, basically. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1488.06s)]
*  But any of these people have tried to influence the way he thinks. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1490.78s)]
*  Now, man, he grew up without a dad. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1493.7s)]
*  So you don't even have to take that question into consideration. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1495.46s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1498.78s)]
*  I mean, that's a great point. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1499.78s)]
*  Like if if the Joe Rogan podcast didn't exist for the, you know, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1501.46s)]
*  the CIA and political plea, well connected people [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1506.46s)]
*  to launder their propaganda through the CIA, they would invent the Joe Rogan podcast. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1510.6200000000001s)]
*  And I'm not 100 percent sure that they did not. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1515.42s)]
*  Like those are the two like the Joe Rogan podcast and the Alex [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1517.42s)]
*  Joan podcast are the two podcasts that are like, you know, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1520.38s)]
*  very questionable in terms of their relationship with [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1524.74s)]
*  dispelling conspiracy theories as opposed to promoting [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1529.38s)]
*  status quo friendly ones. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1534.02s)]
*  Right. Like Joe Rogan's podcast is like it's always like a sheep's idea [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1535.9s)]
*  of a free thinker. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1539.74s)]
*  But, you know, and he has like he he just has the illusion of somebody [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1540.9s)]
*  who like is very considerate in what he's thinking about. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1545.42s)]
*  It's very it's very like it's just crazy how many people like just tune [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1547.8600000000001s)]
*  directly into propaganda on the Joe Rogan podcast. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1551.42s)]
*  But that's what he's commodified. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1553.9s)]
*  Every man thing that obscures what he's actually selling to people. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1555.7800000000002s)]
*  But Alex Jones is so like considered about it that he literally has made [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1559.66s)]
*  the same accusation that a guy named David Icke is doing to conspiracies, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1563.82s)]
*  what he's actually doing, which Alex John Rotson, a great British journalist, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1568.74s)]
*  has a book called them where he goes in. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1573.54s)]
*  It goes with Alex Jones to Bohemian Grove. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1575.98s)]
*  But Alex Jones called David Icke, a guy who's putting a turd in the punch [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1577.74s)]
*  bowl of conspiracy theories. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1581.54s)]
*  That's what these guys are doing. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1583.3799999999999s)]
*  It's the same way like the farcical Epstein [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1584.6599999999999s)]
*  client list and all that stuff. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1587.8999999999999s)]
*  It's turned the punch bowl and all this stuff so they can move on. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1589.3799999999999s)]
*  Let's just do a little bit more because this is like the part [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1591.58s)]
*  about the Qatari op just to drive it home about Tim Poole and his audience [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1593.42s)]
*  that we sort of alluded to. Right. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1597.46s)]
*  It's about the stuff he's going to say. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1599.54s)]
*  I can't speak too much on the nuclear deals, blah, blah, blah. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1600.54s)]
*  Considering this was Chatham House and it was expected whatever he said [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1603.22s)]
*  was going to come out. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1605.7s)]
*  I didn't see anything really substantive. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1608.02s)]
*  However, in the story, they say Poole expressed concerns about increased [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1610.7s)]
*  anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism in the pro-Trump podcasting space, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1614.7s)]
*  according to sources in the room. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1617.22s)]
*  So they weren't there. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1618.26s)]
*  Paul famously at Kanye West and his podcast podcast. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1619.3400000000001s)]
*  And the rapper walked out mid interview after Poole pushed back against anti-Semitic [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1621.62s)]
*  comments, responding to Poole. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1624.3799999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu said that the reason he invited the group is to meet with him to me. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1626.06s)]
*  Poole argued that that there is a Qatari op to manipulate social media algorithms [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1630.98s)]
*  to make anti-Semitic and anti-Israel episodes appear to receive far more views [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1634.78s)]
*  and say tips are picking up women in order to incentivize podcasters and YouTubers [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1638.02s)]
*  to produce more anti-Semitic content. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1641.98s)]
*  Netanyahu, however, was noncommittal in his response, saying [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1643.98s)]
*  that's only possible fake news. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1645.9399999999998s)]
*  How dare you, Tim? Absolute fake news. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1647.9399999999998s)]
*  It's close to reality, but this is what they do. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1650.46s)]
*  OK, first, the person was there clearly wasn't there. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1652.74s)]
*  Ask somebody who then can say incorrectly what I actually said. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1654.78s)]
*  What were you saying, Vinder? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1658.6200000000001s)]
*  It's fake, absolute fake news, but also close to reality. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1660.1000000000001s)]
*  What? What? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1664.26s)]
*  All right. I guess I can explain, but I'm dying to know [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1668.66s)]
*  what could possibly be fake news, but close to reality. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1671.26s)]
*  Me too. It's the liminal space. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1674.6200000000001s)]
*  It's very complex. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1676.58s)]
*  I said there has been a report released from pro-Israel sources [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1679.54s)]
*  alleging Qatar is funding bots and operations to promote anti-Israel content. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1683.82s)]
*  Is there any evidence that's true? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1688.9799999999998s)]
*  And he said, I don't know, it's possible. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1690.9799999999998s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1692.6999999999998s)]
*  I did not say they actually were doing that because I don't know [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1693.6599999999999s)]
*  that they're actually doing it. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1696.1399999999999s)]
*  However, I did to a variety of people express what I've expressed on this show [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1697.4599999999998s)]
*  that there are clearly bots that are anti-Israel, anti-Semitic. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1702.6999999999998s)]
*  That is not to say that people who are critical of Israel don't exist [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1706.6200000000001s)]
*  or that no one is critical of Israel. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1709.54s)]
*  People's. That's about enough. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1711.14s)]
*  Every accusation is a confession. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1712.9s)]
*  I'm just like in awe of how much he's revealing here, to be honest with you. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1714.5s)]
*  First of all, his issue with the report is that he he actually he said what he said, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1718.78s)]
*  but he phrased it in the form of a question instead of a statement, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1723.82s)]
*  which is, yeah, it's it's relevant, sure. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1727.02s)]
*  But it's also the real meat of what's being reported. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1729.5s)]
*  Like that's the point is the question he asked and then what [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1734.26s)]
*  Netanyahu's response was, which is in that article, honestly. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1738.58s)]
*  Well, but also just the idea that Netanyahu, it's included in here, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1742.1s)]
*  said the reason he invited the group is to meet with Poole. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1746.5s)]
*  Why would that be the case if there isn't some preexisting relationship? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1750.4599999999998s)]
*  I'm open to the idea that there isn't one and that just perhaps he's a big fan. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1754.74s)]
*  But we already know that Tim Poole has taken money from the Russian government. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1760.1799999999998s)]
*  Unwittingly, he was victimized by the millions. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1765.78s)]
*  We get it. But he's done so. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1767.6599999999999s)]
*  And he's a proven mark, in other words. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1770.3799999999999s)]
*  And so Netanyahu specifically wanted to meet with skateboard [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1772.46s)]
*  enthusiast Tim Poole on his visit to the United States. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1777.5s)]
*  Oh, I want to know how to do those kickflips, Tim, please. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1781.1799999999998s)]
*  And also that he's telling on himself with the Qatari. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1784.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah, right. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1787.22s)]
*  That that gives the IDF morale to see such a strong man in the United States [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1788.8600000000001s)]
*  with his skate park. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1794.14s)]
*  This is what they're fighting for with Western civilization. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1795.1000000000001s)]
*  When they bring up Qatar, it's because they're upset that Qatar partially funds Al Jazeera, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1798.26s)]
*  which is one of the only news outlets that has the resources [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1802.78s)]
*  to document Israel's genocide of the Palestinians. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1806.66s)]
*  So, again, this is another accusation as a confession thing. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1810.06s)]
*  Even bringing up Qatar to Netanyahu to me [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1813.3s)]
*  indicates that it's like, well, if I take Israeli money, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1816.9s)]
*  I'm just speculating if I take Israeli money, I mean, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1820.42s)]
*  it's because there's Qatar on the other side doing the same thing. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1823.26s)]
*  Anyway, that was meatier than I thought it would be. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1828.0600000000002s)]
*  Kind of interesting. Just throwing that out there. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1830.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, maybe maybe we're maybe we're thinking that in Yahoo wanted to meet [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1832.66s)]
*  YouTuber Tim Poole or journalist Tim Poole, but really he wanted to meet [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1837.6200000000001s)]
*  iTunes chop-tarting music artist Tim Poole. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1842.66s)]
*  He's a big fan of Tim Poole's music. Maybe that was it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1845.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I still remember talking to you before you debated Tim Poole [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1848.6200000000001s)]
*  and knowing that Israel was a sore spot. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1852.8200000000002s)]
*  And at this date, I can't remember what it was that made that evident. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1855.3400000000001s)]
*  But it was obvious. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1859.18s)]
*  And it's nice to know that, you know, yeah, he's taken medians [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1860.7800000000002s)]
*  that he thought were under Chatham House rules, but you get reported anyway. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1863.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's funny because Tim Poole's on the defensive here. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1868.7s)]
*  Obviously, he's received pushback from this meeting. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1871.3s)]
*  I think, you know, the non silver lining, the gray lining, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1873.8999999999999s)]
*  is it's largely from like a growing, like anti Semitic portion of the right. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1877.5s)]
*  They're becoming more and more vocal and they're becoming more and more vocal [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1882.74s)]
*  as they become more and more dissatisfied with Donald Trump's actions. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1886.58s)]
*  And, you know, are able to recruit more people [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1890.22s)]
*  who become dissatisfied with Donald Trump's actions and are looking for [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1892.58s)]
*  an easy explanation for why he's behaving this way, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1895.1s)]
*  why he's ruining people's lives with tariffs, why he's, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1898.22s)]
*  you know, getting rid of the Department of Education and therefore [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1901.06s)]
*  your little brother is not going to have occupational therapy at school anymore. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1903.86s)]
*  Like people are going to be looking for reasons why this is happening. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1906.82s)]
*  And the far right just has no problem platforming anti Semites. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1910.18s)]
*  And that's going to be their go to explanation every time Trump pulls out [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1914.02s)]
*  Netanyahu's seat, they're giving them more evidence of like a global conspiracy [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1916.74s)]
*  that is actually just like, no, it's just neoliberalism. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1921.18s)]
*  It's just the same same old thing that the left is always talking about. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1923.98s)]
*  And you see how they package it to attack the left, like Tim Poole saying, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1927.34s)]
*  well, you got a smaller portion on the right that's anti war, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1930.46s)]
*  which is a good thing and it's defensible. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1934.3400000000001s)]
*  But then you have all these people on the left that are just they hate Israel. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1936.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And Netanyahu sees that. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1939.54s)]
*  And like all these like the Candace Owens sort of [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1941.54s)]
*  a rump that is going anti Semitic as a result of this, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1944.82s)]
*  they will be used as a cudgel to attack. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1948.26s)]
*  Like they already are the protesters as anti Semitic themselves. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1950.94s)]
*  Well, I mean, they know that like there's going to be a new market [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1955.14s)]
*  for like anti Semitic content because, you know, people are going to not be [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1957.62s)]
*  exposed to the left critique of Israel on modern platforms. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1961.82s)]
*  They're not going to be exposed to the left critique of Israel. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1966.2199999999998s)]
*  This is the always the way in which, like, you know, the center empowers fascists [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1969.1799999999998s)]
*  because they're going to hold up like people like Candace Owens [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1973.86s)]
*  as like the face of the pro-Palestinian, the anti-Israel movement in America [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1976.9399999999998s)]
*  because she's vocally anti Semitic. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1982.9799999999998s)]
*  And so people who feel strongly and are uninformed about [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1985.06s)]
*  the Palestinian situation are going to see Candace Owens as the only person, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1989.1s)]
*  like the only person who's speaking to this this genocide, the only person. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1994.5s)]
*  And that's going to make her a more attractive person. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=1998.78s)]
*  They're just relying on this idea that they can call everything anti Semitic [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2000.74s)]
*  and that they can platform clearly like Hitler or Jaysha commentators [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2004.4199999999998s)]
*  to like just tamp down on anti Israel sentiment. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2008.62s)]
*  And maybe it will have some of that effect. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2012.02s)]
*  But the alternative effect that it will definitely have is that it will make [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2014.1s)]
*  more people feel like the only acceptable way to critique Israel is to be [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2017.62s)]
*  actually anti Semitic, like, you know, Candace Owens is. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2022.54s)]
*  And that just creates a market for anti Semitism. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2025.8999999999999s)]
*  It creates more anti Semites, which we said it's like what they want, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2028.34s)]
*  because that's the core value proposition of Israel. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2031.8999999999999s)]
*  But it does just increase the total number of anti Semites out there. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2034.5s)]
*  Just a quick sentence to bolster that is that Candace Owens is a top five [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2038.4599999999998s)]
*  political podcast in the country. I saw that the other day. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2043.58s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm glad you just said that, too, because it bolsters. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2046.26s)]
*  What I'm going to say is that I think everyone should do more to remind [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2048.7s)]
*  or not even remind to inform because they probably don't even realize it or no. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2053.98s)]
*  Everyone needs to do more to inform everyone that the reason Candace Owens [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2057.78s)]
*  has the platform she has is thanks to the biggest right wing [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2062.42s)]
*  pro-Israel podcaster on the planet, Ben Shapiro, who funded her for years [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2067.46s)]
*  and made her the superstar on the right she is today. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYz9a7qB3jw&t=2073.3s)]
