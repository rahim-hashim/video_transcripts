# How Biden Helped Israel Hide The Truth About Journalist’s Assassination
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM)
*  Zateo's documentary executive producer, Dion Nesbem, outlining that there's two major revelations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=0.0s)]
*  in this documentary in terms of the killing of Shireen Abu Akhlai and the Biden administration's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=8.08s)]
*  involvement in basically the supposed investigation that was done into her kill it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Let's play this clip. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=24.96s)]
*  We welcome you all to Democracy Now! Dion, we're going to begin with you. This is the third [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=26.720000000000002s)]
*  anniversary, May 11th exactly, of the death of Shireen Abu Akhlai. Talk about your revelation, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=32.32s)]
*  what you exposed in this documentary. Well, there are two things that were very important [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  for the documentary. The first thing was we wanted to find the soldier who killed Shireen. It had [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  been one of the most closely guarded secrets in Israel. U.S. officials said that if they wanted [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=53.92s)]
*  to determine if there was a crime here, if there was a human rights violation, they needed to talk [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  to this soldier to find out what he was thinking when he shot her. And we set out to find him, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=65.84s)]
*  and we did. We did what the U.S. government never did, and it turned out he had been killed. So we [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=72.48s)]
*  were never able to answer that question, what he was thinking. But the other revelation that I think [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=78.56s)]
*  is as significant in this documentary is that the initial U.S. assessment of her shooting was that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=84.72s)]
*  that soldier intentionally shot her and that he could tell that she was wearing a blue flak jacket [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  with press across it. That assessment was essentially overruled by the Biden administration, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=101.52s)]
*  which came out and said exactly the opposite. That's a fairly startling revelation that the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  Biden administration and the Israeli government essentially were doing everything they could [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=116.24s)]
*  to cover up what happened that day to Shireen Abu Akhlai. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=122.0s)]
*  So if you'll recall, Shireen Abu Akhlai was the Palestinian journalist who was killed, and this was [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=125.6s)]
*  a major, obviously this was before October 7th we should add, this was years ago. And there was [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=132.88s)]
*  an investigation into her killing because she was clearly wearing everything we saw of her prior work [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  and the photographs that came out that day that she was clearly wearing identifying [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=150.88s)]
*  press gear, a uniform that clearly identified her as press. And it appears, based on this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  investigation that the Zateo documentary has performed, everything we've heard about the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=167.04s)]
*  IDF soldier who shot and killed her not knowing she was press is frankly bullshit, which [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=175.12s)]
*  what we know now after the years now of this genocide in Gaza and what has since come out [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=184.32s)]
*  about the Biden administration flat out misrepresenting and frankly outright lying [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=191.68s)]
*  lying. Their role or what I should say their non-existent role in apparently advocating for [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=197.92s)]
*  a ceasefire in Gaza in their non-existent negotiations with Israel shouldn't come as [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  a surprise now. Now that we know all of this about just how the Biden administration viewed [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  frankly every single thing that Israel did in Gaza as you know, I guess in their view above the board [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=219.6s)]
*  and AOK regardless of whatever the investigation actually laid out factually. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=227.04s)]
*  It's important to emphasize how deeply genocidal this Biden administration was. Like you said, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=235.6s)]
*  Binder, the initial reports was and even calls from American spokespeople saying Israel needs [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=242.16s)]
*  to prosecute the people who murdered her to the fullest extent. And then Blinken gets involved [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=248.0s)]
*  and over the course of several weeks initially calls for an independent investigation. And then [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=255.28s)]
*  a few weeks later his language changes a little bit despite him lying through his teeth started [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=260.24s)]
*  in the statement saying there has been no change in our approach. We continue to call for a thorough [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=264.88s)]
*  credible investigation that culminates in accountability. So they went from calling for [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=270.24s)]
*  saying Israel needs to prosecute that guy to oh we need an investigation to figure out what happened [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=275.76s)]
*  on an independent one to okay Israel can do the investigation but it just needs to be a thorough one. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=280.4s)]
*  How stupid do they think people are? I mean that and obviously this was pre-October 7. This is how [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  Zionists operate like Blinken and with Sullivan and those sorts of folks. This is a crime of the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=292.23999999999995s)]
*  century. All these people should be in fucking prison. Right. No but you brought up is an [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=300.56s)]
*  excellent point. I think people should I don't think people are stupid but I do think there are [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=306.24s)]
*  people who don't have media literacy sometimes and they don't notice the changes in in this case the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=310.88s)]
*  changes in language that completely changes what Biden's position on this was. The call from an [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=319.36s)]
*  investigation to his term was like a credible or thorough credible a thorough credible investigation. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  The the change in language there is very important because what that points to is that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=334.56s)]
*  things were coming out in an investigation even if it was a preliminary investigation [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=341.68s)]
*  that did not toe what Israel and the Biden administration's line was going to be or what [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=348.72s)]
*  they had hoped to be the truth or what they wanted the truth to be what their version of the truth to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=354.8s)]
*  be and once that comes out they add that thorough and credible investigation line [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=360.08s)]
*  not only to call for a different type of investigation but to subtly claim that the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=367.04s)]
*  stuff we've already heard in an investigation is not can't be true because it wasn't thorough [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=374.08s)]
*  or it wasn't credible enough. It's poking holes in what people are hearing in terms of on the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=381.76s)]
*  ground reports and whatever preliminary investigation or full investigation whatever [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=388.8s)]
*  was already being done. It's to demean and basically deny the facts on the ground in order to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=393.04s)]
*  hope that people fall for it and you know again I don't think people are stupid but there are [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=401.12s)]
*  people who are susceptible to that stuff and that's why they do it. They wouldn't do it if it wasn't [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=407.2s)]
*  successful. It's a running the clock out thing it's just like people look people don't pay super [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=411.36s)]
*  close attention and they can be snowed but over the course of time like look at polling on this [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=418.56s)]
*  issue like they you can't fool people this much you can't do a genocide I mean this is post-sacrifice [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=422.32s)]
*  but you can't just have journalists being shot and then say well you know it's actually nuanced [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=428.88s)]
*  we need to hear all sides on this no we need the we need to stop covering for Israel it's as simple [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=435.6s)]
*  as that. Right and this was this was we should have this was targeted it wasn't like she was in [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=442.72s)]
*  a group of people which wouldn't be okay either but then they would be able to argue that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=447.2s)]
*  This was this was targeted this was she was she was shot and killed in a targeted frankly assassination. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=452.4s)]
*  Yeah yeah I mean the camera was the Israeli and some Israeli [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=460.0s)]
*  official said she was armed with a camera. Yeah I mean and I think they've been very clear that they [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=466.08s)]
*  feel like journalists are part of the you know Hamas war effort because they accurately document [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=471.6s)]
*  the crimes that they are committing in Gaza which paints them in a you know a negative light which [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=477.76000000000005s)]
*  we've seen you know both in their domestic policy and their foreign policy and their sort of like [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=482.32000000000005s)]
*  apartheid policy as well as the United States domestic policy it is treated almost like an act [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=487.6s)]
*  of war if you contradict the official narrative of what's going on in Israel with the Palestinian [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=492.72s)]
*  genocide and I should also say you know the thorough incredible investigation to me signals [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=500.72s)]
*  that they want the investigation to at least look reasonable as well because you know part of this [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=505.6s)]
*  is also to pretend that still Israel has the capacity to police itself that Israel has the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=511.20000000000005s)]
*  capacity as a you know brutal ethno-nationalist apartheid state to police its own excesses when [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=516.32s)]
*  it comes to the displacement at the cleansing and genocide of Palestinians not just because like [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  that's part of our mythology around Israel and ourselves but also because like it's key to [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=527.44s)]
*  ensure that Israel prior to October 7th was going to you know not be subject to outside [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  investigations by the U.S. by the UN for not doing these kinds of investigations in a credible and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  thorough manner because they would be violating the the complementarity cause because if you're [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=547.0400000000001s)]
*  not actually investigating things that look like human rights violations or war crimes in your [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=552.4000000000001s)]
*  country then the UN is much more likely to get involved not that the UN we've seen will do [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=557.12s)]
*  anything if they continue but prior to October 7th in the continued genocide the UN investigation [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=562.16s)]
*  looking into it would have probably shown something that was less like Biden was afraid of less [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=568.8s)]
*  flattering to the Israeli narrative. I want to be real it's not just Israel I mean Israel is the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=574.64s)]
*  most the country we most egregiously cover for but oh yeah now I just blanked out his name the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=580.88s)]
*  guy who got boned side in Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=586.72s)]
*  Khashoggi yeah exactly yeah. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=589.2s)]
*  How like and this is especially egregious with like Saudi Arabia especially all these corporations [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  now are getting in bed with them as they seek out to paint the country as you know the Saudi [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=604.1600000000001s)]
*  Kingdom seek to paint the country in a more positive light and all these companies that are [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=610.24s)]
*  totally like you know rah rah about patriotism and remember never forget 9-11 and then they're [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=614.72s)]
*  getting you know taking Saudi money it's it's amazing to me that one especially. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=621.6s)]
*  Well I mean I think we have to also acknowledge that Israel is used to obfuscate the reality of [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=627.76s)]
*  the United States of America's like foreign policy like we try to frame Israel in a certain [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  way because it benefits a larger narrative that we have about like the United States's aims in [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  the region which is also why we try to like obscure our relationship with actors in the region [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=643.12s)]
*  who we aren't able to portray as easily as like a real democracy with liberal values like the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=648.72s)]
*  Qataris or like the Saudis and so like that also helps Israel in the end because they get to pretend [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=654.48s)]
*  by nature of the fact that like well there's some they they seem that they are some kind of special [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=660.16s)]
*  democracy and that's and that's why America supports them but if people were fully aware [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=666.0s)]
*  of like the context of who America supports you know both openly and secretly around the world [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=671.84s)]
*  it would paint Israel and our support for Israel in a negative light because they're like oh you [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=677.2800000000001s)]
*  know America loves to support dictatorships America has never found like a brutal military junta that [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=681.0400000000001s)]
*  it didn't want to support like that's and Israel doesn't want to be portrayed in that light too it [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=686.8000000000001s)]
*  really is a very codependent relationship in ways that like when you don't like have the full [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  picture oftentimes just give rise to anti-semitic tropes that people want to believe and are much [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FP6KgUhDXM&t=696.64s)]
