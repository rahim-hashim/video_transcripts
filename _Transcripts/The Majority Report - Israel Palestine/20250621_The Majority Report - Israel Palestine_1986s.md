*  uh... of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=25.52s)]
*  what is now a uh... full-on war it seems to me between israel and iran [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  uh... [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=32.96s)]
*  uh... let let's go back and give us the sort of the background at least in terms [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=34.56s)]
*  of like [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=39.28s)]
*  the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=40.44s)]
*  desire to attack iran [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=41.4s)]
*  has been [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=44.04s)]
*  i mean at least in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=45.9s)]
*  my awareness [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=47.24s)]
*  this is something [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=48.8s)]
*  uh... that was on the agenda of neo cons [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=49.96s)]
*  in the run-up to the iraq war [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=54.72s)]
*  the ideas were going to take a rack [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=57.0s)]
*  we're going to make that into a uh... you know [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=58.92s)]
*  uh... a democracy we're going to be met with uh... [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=61.4s)]
*  candy and flowers [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=64.56s)]
*  then syria [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=66.08s)]
*  uh... and uh... [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=67.44s)]
*  uh... ron was on that list [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=70.04s)]
*  uh... [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=72.32s)]
*  you give us a sense of just like [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=73.4s)]
*  particularly from the perspective of the israelis but also in the context of the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=75.88s)]
*  new and neoconservative uh... movement [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=78.92s)]
*  well yeah going back to the iranian revolution of nineteen seventy nine you [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=82.48s)]
*  know uh... [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=87.64s)]
*  the united states [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=88.76s)]
*  particularly neoconservatives but you know [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  many american [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=93.36s)]
*  uh... policy elites uh... have uh... wanted to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  you know engage in this uh... [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=99.76s)]
*  grudge match between the two countries the iranians have wanted to engage the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=102.04s)]
*  united states have wanted to engage that's a bipartisan thing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=105.76s)]
*  but you're right that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=109.56s)]
*  neoconservatives you know before nine eleven were thinking about [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  uh... [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=116.44s)]
*  iran iraq [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  uh... [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=119.44s)]
*  course iran iraq had a long war throughout the nineteen eighties [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=120.52s)]
*  uh... which we can both sides [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=124.8s)]
*  we i mean we certainly supplied uh... uh... iraq with i mean [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=127.96s)]
*  some of the chemical warfare that we thought that they ostensibly had when or [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=134.04s)]
*  claim that we had uh... they had uh... when [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=138.44s)]
*  uh... we [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=141.64s)]
*  uh... invaded iraq [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=143.44s)]
*  yeah i mean so with the u.s. government you know considered [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=145.32s)]
*  iraq to be the lesser of the two evils [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=150.52s)]
*  uh... when the two sides were going head-to-head but i think you know most [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=154.12s)]
*  importantly [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=158.52s)]
*  for [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=159.8s)]
*  understanding the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=160.96s)]
*  present predicament [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=162.44s)]
*  uh... it's been the goal of of israel uh... and particularly prime minister [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=164.16s)]
*  benjamin netanyahu [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=169.24s)]
*  uh... to make sure that iran never gets a nuclear weapon to try to shut down [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=171.72s)]
*  any amount of activity that could in the future be used [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=179.08s)]
*  uh... by iran to get a nuclear weapon and even more than that to obstruct u.s. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=183.32s)]
*  efforts [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=189.4s)]
*  which have now occurred on a bipartisan basis [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=190.72s)]
*  uh... to reach a deal with iran [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=194.12s)]
*  that would provide for international inspections to ensure that iran [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=197.2s)]
*  could not make [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=202.28s)]
*  a nuclear weapon so in this case it isn't [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=203.38s)]
*  you know u.s. neocons that are [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=206.5s)]
*  pushing events [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=209.2s)]
*  but rather the government of israel uh... which decided to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=211.28s)]
*  uh... you know it says it wanted to preempt [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=216.8s)]
*  an iranian nuclear weapon but iran was some distance from being able to make a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=219.52s)]
*  nuclear weapon in fact [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=224.24s)]
*  uh... both u.s. and intelligence uh... and israeli intelligence [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=226.36s)]
*  uh... have recently said that iran had not made a decision to pursue a nuclear [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=230.96s)]
*  weapon though it had [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  taken steps uh... in that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=238.8s)]
*  direction by highly enriching [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=241.52s)]
*  uranium so netanyahu wanted to preempt another round of u.s. iran [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=244.24s)]
*  talks [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=249.28s)]
*  uh... that might [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=250.44s)]
*  bring a new nuclear deal [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=251.8s)]
*  into fruition [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=254.24s)]
*  but doesn't i mean [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=255.6s)]
*  there's something that is uh... inherently contradictory there it seems [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=257.66s)]
*  to me [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=261.36s)]
*  uh... [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=262.2s)]
*  and and i wonder if uh... [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=264.14s)]
*  israel's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=267.12s)]
*  uh... [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=268.56s)]
*  fear of a of a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=270.44s)]
*  nuclear iran [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=272.4s)]
*  is also sort of the a uh... [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=274.1s)]
*  a little bit of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=279.3s)]
*  and is something we can all agree on quality of like a paul wolfowitz in the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=282.3s)]
*  sense that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=287.18s)]
*  uh... [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=288.26000000000005s)]
*  we had a deal with iran that was the jcp uh... uh... uh... uh... a away [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=290.5s)]
*  uh... that being that you know the first iran newt deal that by all accounts [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  iran was uh... [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=302.8s)]
*  adhering to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=305.68s)]
*  they have expressed a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=308.88s)]
*  i mean what appears to be a mean you know i can and uh... the different [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=312.04s)]
*  people can take it if a spell you're not [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=315.44s)]
*  a reluctance to develop uh... a nuclear weapon [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  there were negotiations that by all accounts seem to be not necessarily [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  easy [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=327.52s)]
*  but certainly being sincere uh... uh... that uh... both sides were engaging in [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=328.56s)]
*  and this was seems designed completely to short-circuit that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=334.48s)]
*  which you know if i'm a run right now i'm thinking [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=339.84s)]
*  the biggest mistake we ever made [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  was not developing a weapon when uh... trump shut this down because none of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=345.16s)]
*  this attack would happen if we had a new weapon [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=349.64s)]
*  uh... [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=352.2s)]
*  uh... how how is this really [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=354.32s)]
*  an attempt to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=356.64s)]
*  forestall an iranian uh... uh... nuclear weapon [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  if [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=363.0s)]
*  this is launched in the midst of negotiations that very well and may [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=364.48s)]
*  have done that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=368.88s)]
*  well israel [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  jayden want negotiations to happen [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=372.64s)]
*  uh... [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  you know you could say that maybe the israelis didn't believe that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=378.22s)]
*  what iran agreed to what really prevented ultimately forgetting a [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=382.68s)]
*  nuclear weapon but [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=386.74s)]
*  i agree with you something else is going on here [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=388.94s)]
*  and i think that something else is in part [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=392.94s)]
*  uh... the perceived opportunity [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=396.38s)]
*  uh... that israel had [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=398.98s)]
*  uh... to go after iran and weaken the regime [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=401.22s)]
*  maybe even see if they could topple the regime [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=405.06s)]
*  uh... we don't quite know what israel's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=408.6s)]
*  war aims are right now and what they will fall into [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=411.18s)]

*  to iran [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=466.22s)]

*  it's doing right now to iran trying to paralyze leadership [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=489.53999999999996s)]

*  being able to fire rockets into northern israel [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=498.18s)]
*  uh... and then uh... [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=502.02s)]
*  it dot dot some luck when uh... aside [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=504.58s)]
*  who is uh... aligned with iran [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=509.58s)]
*  uh... when his regime melted away towards the end of the year [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=512.3s)]
*  and so the israelis uh... you know saw that they made it may might never get a [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=516.52s)]
*  better time [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=521.9s)]
*  uh... to strike iran [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=523.74s)]
*  uh... then you know [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=526.24s)]
*  uh... what they could do in the first half of this year [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=528.52s)]
*  so it was coming up to a kind of now or never choice for them i think [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  in their mind and yet they didn't want to go down the road of another j c p o a [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=538.04s)]
*  this time with donald trump who might actually be able to make it stick [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=543.98s)]
*  uh... more than obama because ironically trump was the one who [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=547.8s)]
*  stupidly walked out of the j c p o a [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=552.12s)]
*  during his first [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=555.18s)]
*  term in the hopes of getting some kind of better deal that has never [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=556.64s)]
*  materialized so i think [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=560.96s)]
*  uh... you know [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=563.0s)]
*  look israel's been traumatized after the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=564.2s)]
*  october seventh [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=567.62s)]
*  twenty twenty three attacks much like the united states after nine eleven [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=569.52s)]
*  it's become less except that risk [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=573.94s)]
*  uh... from external enemies [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=576.88s)]
*  much as the united states was more willing to do things that [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=579.36s)]
*  it previously [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=583.0600000000001s)]
*  went to dot and so now it's taken a big gamble gone after [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=584.22s)]
*  iran and it's hoping that the united states will ultimately [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=587.82s)]
*  uh... [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=591.88s)]
*  uh... either continue to support israel or even join in which i think is a major [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=592.72s)]
*  risk because ultimately that [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=597.6800000000001s)]
*  to be able to knock back [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=600.0s)]
*  uh... iran's nuclear program [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=601.7s)]
*  uh... [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=604.52s)]
*  one has to hit [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=605.48s)]
*  uh... [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=607.12s)]
*  in particular [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=608.16s)]
*  a site in ford o'connor on buried deep in the mountains and it's widely believe [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=609.9399999999999s)]
*  that only the united states has the capabilities to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=614.74s)]
*  to to do that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=618.6999999999999s)]
*  i should also say though that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=619.76s)]
*  even a u s even a direct u s strike [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=621.48s)]
*  you know it may set back [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=625.12s)]
*  uh... the iranian [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=627.28s)]
*  program for [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=629.56s)]
*  uh... maybe [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=631.92s)]
*  several years [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=633.0799999999999s)]
*  but by the same token as you mentioned [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=634.88s)]
*  uh... it may make a run [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=638.08s)]
*  conclude that it's mistake [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=640.12s)]
*  uh... was to not actually [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=642.56s)]
*  proceed to make a nuclear weapon [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=645.16s)]
*  and iran can [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=647.9s)]
*  uh... as long as it has some scientists left [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=649.78s)]
*  and can do that [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=654.0s)]
*  uh... and can be deceptive it can pull out of the nuclear nonproliferation [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=655.2s)]
*  treaty [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=658.2s)]
*  uh... and it can speed toward a nuclear weapon [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=659.8s)]
*  how much of this timing was also motivated by what's going on for net [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=663.6s)]
*  and yahoo domestically [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=668.08s)]
*  so good question i mean i [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=670.84s)]
*  uh... i don't know if he he's already got uh... a war in his hands [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=673.48s)]
*  in gaza and [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=677.9200000000001s)]
*  also fighting in the west bank [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=680.6800000000001s)]
*  so [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=683.0400000000001s)]
*  you know [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=684.22s)]
*  i think the connection to netanyahu's own [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=684.96s)]
*  political faith is a little clear there [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=688.36s)]
*  uh... [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=691.48s)]
*  but [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=692.34s)]
*  it's true that netanyahu has gone from looking dead in the water [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=693.2s)]
*  uh... to [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=697.6400000000001s)]
*  uh... [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=699.48s)]
*  escaping you know prosecution himself and surviving politically as the israeli [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=700.48s)]
*  prime minister yet again [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=705.5600000000001s)]
*  uh... because of the wars that he's prosecuted uh... since october seventh [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=707.96s)]
*  and for him to stop them completely [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=713.3000000000001s)]
*  uh... i think would then expose him to [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=716.6600000000001s)]
*  accountability within israel so how much you can pin to this singular act [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=720.1s)]
*  against iran [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=725.8s)]
*  uh... i'm not i'm not sure but does he have a disturbing is set up [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=727.6s)]
*  uh... to continue with military action [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=732.5s)]
*  yes [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=735.5s)]
*  uh... [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=737.22s)]
*  getting back to the idea that uh... uh... israel found this to be its most [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=738.22s)]
*  opportune time because uh... [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=742.74s)]
*  uh... iranian [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=745.7s)]
*  proxies or iranian allied forces [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=747.84s)]

*  uh... [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=753.72s)]
*  respond on iran's behalf at least to some extent [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=754.7s)]
*  uh... have a white wood [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=758.48s)]
*  what capacity does yemen have i know that they fired as some rockets [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=760.6600000000001s)]
*  uh... [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=765.9200000000001s)]
*  what capacity does yemen have been how concerned is israel i know that the [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=767.7600000000001s)]
*  israeli think also attack yemen if i'm not mistaken so what what how much and [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=771.7600000000001s)]
*  is there any other sort of [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=777.38s)]
*  uh... mechanism [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=779.52s)]
*  that iran can deploy [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=781.36s)]
*  to uh... attack israel or or [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=783.92s)]
*  i imagine they're also i mean this is a and an open threat from iran that if [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=788.76s)]
*  you assist [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=793.04s)]
*  in any way [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=794.84s)]
*  and i want to get to that american role in a moment but uh... [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=796.42s)]
*  what what are the other mechanisms that iran has [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=799.6s)]
*  uh... [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=802.36s)]

*  uh... uh... syria or uh... maybe even any type of [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=809.22s)]
*  in western iraq is usually not [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=814.74s)]
*  uh... available to iran in in my understanding that tends to be more [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=817.26s)]
*  cuny [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=821.38s)]
*  what uh... [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=822.34s)]
*  what do they have left [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=824.62s)]
*  yeah i mean uh... it's hard to know right now in the uh... [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=827.36s)]
*  very intense fog of war you know exactly where ronnie and military capabilities [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=832.4s)]
*  stand [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=837.28s)]
*  they have shown the ability [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=838.4s)]
*  including last night [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=840.32s)]
*  to uh... send ballistic missiles into israel to strike an oil refinery [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=841.68s)]
*  in hypha [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=847.32s)]
*  uh... to kill some number of uh... israeli civilians not sure that they're [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=848.5s)]
*  targeting looks like it's in great shape [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=853.92s)]
*  uh... [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=856.6s)]
*  so that's very much in influx but they have uh... you know extensive [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=857.56s)]
*  ballistic [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=861.76s)]
*  ballistic missile capability [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=862.88s)]
*  and they could continue to [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=864.72s)]
*  to use that for for as long as it's possible for them [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=866.5600000000001s)]
*  uh... but yeah that the proxies are are uh... down but not out [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=870.4s)]
*  uh... the the houthis can also join in uh... as they've [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=875.6s)]
*  done in exchange of fire with israel before [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=879.5600000000001s)]
*  and the uh... [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=882.7s)]
*  iranian aligned militias in iraq i think are of particular concern [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=885.1800000000001s)]
*  they could target [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=891.16s)]
*  u.s. service members in iraq [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=893.0s)]
*  uh... in syria as well [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=896.6s)]
*  uh... so that's something to watch for [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=899.36s)]
*  in addition iran could escalate by going after [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  uh... gulf countries saudi arabia [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=907.4s)]
*  the u a e [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=910.24s)]
*  uh... and it could try to block the straight of or moves [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=912.04s)]
*  to disrupt oil so i think if you think about what is iran's strategy here they [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=916.02s)]
*  don't have great moves in the short term it seems to me [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=920.32s)]
*  if they're going to begin [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=925.22s)]
*  and take a beating from israel for a while [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=926.62s)]
*  figuring that their population will unite rather than divide [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=929.74s)]
*  uh... as a result [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=934.82s)]
*  uh... [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=937.22s)]
*  then i think they can make [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=938.1s)]
*  uh... life difficult for united states and donald trump [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=940.22s)]
*  uh... as perhaps oil prices spike [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=945.7800000000001s)]
*  there's a threat that [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=948.8s)]
*  uh... u.s. service members will be targeted and a wider war that could [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=950.4599999999999s)]
*  drawing united states directly which president trump doesn't want to happen [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=955.48s)]
*  so [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=960.0s)]
*  you know that's something i think to look for [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=961.36s)]
*  uh... it's a little unfortunately silver easier for me to imagine [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=964.1s)]
*  a long-term scenario right now for this conflict than how we get out of it [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=968.1999999999999s)]
*  within days [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=972.68s)]
*  how much uh... you mentioned u a e in saudi arabia uh... that [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=974.3199999999999s)]
*  iran may take but it felt like in the past year or so [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=978.72s)]
*  there has been some form of a reproach mark between saudi arabia and iran who [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=984.74s)]
*  have been [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=989.94s)]
*  at least as far as i can tell the last couple decades [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=991.58s)]
*  almost like you know waging a proxy war over the course of that full twenty [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=994.5400000000001s)]
*  years it seems like [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=998.78s)]
*  but there was some type of a reproach mark how much [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1000.34s)]
*  how much of that [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1004.5s)]
*  reproach mark was real [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1005.86s)]
*  what are the possibilities that saudi arabia is is sort of like sitting on the [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1008.56s)]
*  sideline uh... [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1012.76s)]
*  maybe cheering israel on in you know in private like what what's that dynamic [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1014.64s)]
*  so there was a real [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1020.9599999999999s)]
*  rapprochement may be [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1022.4599999999999s)]
*  like bordering on too strong a word but there was a real re-engagement [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1024.74s)]
*  diplomatically [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1028.48s)]
*  a movement toward a cold peace rather than a hot one [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1030.62s)]
*  uh... [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1035.36s)]
*  so there there was real movement and i think that's uh... a good thing right [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1037.24s)]
*  now insofar as it will disincline iran to to strike [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1041.46s)]
*  those countries [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1046.06s)]
*  uh... and one big difference between uh... [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1047.76s)]
*  uh... negotiations that led to the jcpo and or obama [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1050.6200000000001s)]
*  and the current negotiations under trump was that the uh... golf states [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1055.26s)]
*  were opposed to the former but actually supported [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1061.76s)]
*  the latter [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1066.04s)]
*  so that's maybe a bit of good news in terms of regional dynamics but the [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1067.48s)]
*  flip side of that [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1071.8s)]
*  uh... is you know it's going to be that much harder i think for [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1073.72s)]
*  there to be some kind of uh... normalization between the golf states and [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1078.96s)]
*  and israel [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1083.6s)]
*  so if you're thinking about i think from an american perspective there's always [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1085.08s)]
*  this like [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1088.08s)]
*  fantasy that [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1089.06s)]
*  well we get to some better place in the middle east so the u.s. isn't drawn in [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1090.42s)]
*  uh... [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1095.44s)]
*  you know can we get together some kind of uh... stable equilibrium [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1096.66s)]
*  and [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1102.04s)]
*  uh... we can fantasize about something right now but it looks very very far away [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1103.56s)]
*  and ironically if you think about the trip that trump took [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1109.24s)]
*  uh... to the gulf [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1112.8s)]
*  uh... which was meant to be his first uh... foreign trip [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1114.76s)]
*  uh... of this term [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1119.3200000000002s)]
*  you know he kind of painted this story of a middle east that was on the rise [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1120.76s)]
*  because all the hatreds are being put aside and the u.s. wasn't doing [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1125.0s)]
*  nation-building [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1128.6s)]
*  regime change wars anymore [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1129.96s)]
*  it was going to be more transactional and and favor peace and stability [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1132.72s)]
*  uh... okay that's interesting but this is just not a region that [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1137.2s)]
*  is primed to break out in peace and stability anytime soon [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1141.5s)]
*  it's very hard to see that happening [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1145.96s)]
*  uh... from this current [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1148.32s)]
*  round of uh... military conflict between israel and iran [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1150.18s)]
*  we keep telling ourselves that that's the story [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1154.76s)]
*  uh... you remember the by the ministration also had its version of that [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1157.48s)]
*  story [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1160.24s)]
*  promulgated just before the october seventh attacks and then what [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1161.8799999999999s)]
*  uh... we're back into managing uh... [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1166.6s)]
*  crises and risking the u.s. direct involvement in in more conflict [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1170.32s)]
*  how uh... what is your sense i mean there are two sort of like uh... competing [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1175.4s)]
*  stories as to [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1180.36s)]
*  uh... [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1182.36s)]
*  trumps [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1183.72s)]
*  role in this one is that [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1185.1200000000001s)]
*  he was [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1188.3600000000001s)]
*  buttering up the iranians making them feel confident [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1192.04s)]
*  uh... following these in negotiations and uh... uh... [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1196.48s)]
*  you know uh... uh... pursuing peace [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1202.08s)]
*  uh... and that it was all a ruse [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1205.68s)]
*  to make the iranians uh... confidence so that [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1208.78s)]
*  the chief negotiator was sleeping in his own home [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1211.8999999999999s)]
*  that the several of the top leadership of the iranian uh... government were [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1214.9799999999998s)]
*  sleeping in their own homes [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1219.4599999999998s)]
*  so that israel could take them out [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1221.26s)]
*  the other uh... story [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1222.8799999999999s)]
*  is that [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1224.9399999999998s)]
*  trump had basically said don't do it [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1226.6s)]
*  but didn't say it uh... forcefully enough [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1229.28s)]
*  uh... netanyahu [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1232.34s)]
*  lost the attack everybody knows what's going to happen after that [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1234.58s)]
*  uh... [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1238.3799999999999s)]
*  and gave [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1239.3999999999999s)]
*  trump a cover story that made him seem like uh... a super agent that he was [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1241.3s)]
*  actually just doing this [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1246.54s)]
*  uh... to lull them into a false sense of security and not actually seeking peace [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1248.22s)]
*  which is the one that you uh... [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1252.8600000000001s)]
*  thinking or is there a different story that makes more sense [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1256.38s)]
*  uh... [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1259.54s)]
*  it seems to me if it is the case that he was doing this [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1260.58s)]
*  i don't know how you negotiate anything ever again [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1264.34s)]
*  that's a problem yeah [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1268.74s)]
*  so i i i don't know exactly what happened uh... i think it's a little bit [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1270.82s)]
*  of both [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1274.46s)]
*  but i think mostly [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1275.5s)]
*  uh... you know trump was not [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1277.54s)]
*  uh... leading the iranians down a path [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1280.46s)]
*  over several months [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1282.78s)]
*  in israeli strike on iran [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1285.4199999999998s)]
*  uh... so in that sense there may have been an element of ruse [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1287.6599999999999s)]
*  toward the very end [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1290.6799999999998s)]
*  uh... you know in the day or two prior to the israeli strike [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1292.9399999999998s)]
*  last week but [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1297.6799999999998s)]
*  i suspect that that was it [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1299.4s)]
*  uh... and [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1301.64s)]
*  uh... what it looks like is that you know trump was sincere about trying to [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1303.52s)]
*  have nuclear negotiations [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1307.8000000000002s)]
*  he did not want israel to strike iran figuring that that would [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1310.16s)]
*  uh... damage negotiations which is probably correct [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1314.92s)]
*  uh... [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1319.16s)]
*  but [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1320.24s)]
*  netanyahu discusses with trump [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1321.72s)]
*  and got something that was not a red light [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1324.48s)]
*  maybe he got a green light [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1328.36s)]
*  at some point [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1330.18s)]
*  i'd say more likely based on what's been reported he got a [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1331.68s)]
*  a yellow light [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1335.44s)]
*  from trump [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1337.28s)]
*  uh... but trump didn't say no or spell out consequences [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1338.42s)]
*  uh... for netanyahu if he went ahead perhaps netanyahu convinced him that the [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1342.96s)]
*  strike would actually [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1347.88s)]
*  be good for talks uh... trump believes in uh... coercive diplomacy he [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1349.86s)]
*  when he initiated these talks he said there was a sixty day window [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1355.8s)]
*  uh... now he was [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1359.8799999999999s)]
*  seemingly willing to put that aside for the sake of [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1361.3799999999999s)]
*  uh... talks which were supposed to occur yesterday [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1364.8s)]
*  uh... so you know trump uh... i wouldn't take that too seriously but [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1368.12s)]
*  trump believes in imposing pressure [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1373.1599999999999s)]
*  and negotiating at the point of the gun and so [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1375.7s)]
*  the israeli strike might have [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1378.52s)]
*  uh... occurred to him [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1381.12s)]
*  you know as as somewhat in keeping with [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1382.6s)]
*  with that strategy and since the strikes began he has [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1386.6000000000001s)]
*  uh... repeatedly said that he still wants to [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1390.32s)]
*  get a deal [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1393.7s)]
*  but it's going to be really difficult to get a deal [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1394.82s)]
*  uh... because yes will the iranians trust the united states will the iranians [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1398.38s)]
*  believe that the united states could keep israel [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1402.22s)]
*  from attacking iran again [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1405.18s)]
*  and can uh... the iranians agree to [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1407.94s)]
*  a deal that [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1412.3400000000001s)]
*  israel would [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1413.66s)]
*  think is a win for itself [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1415.1399999999999s)]
*  uh... [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1417.86s)]
*  seemingly that deal would have to be quite draconian for iran [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1419.22s)]
*  which would then entail [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1424.1s)]
*  significant political rest [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1426.02s)]
*  for the iranian leadership as it would just look like a [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1428.1799999999998s)]
*  a defeat and a humiliation so [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1431.3799999999999s)]
*  hard to see how uh... [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1434.7s)]
*  we put negotiations back together [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1436.94s)]
*  and in trump though uh... reportedly has said do not go after coming [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1440.34s)]
*  uh... and which [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1444.54s)]
*  i guess ostensibly would be his way of [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1446.78s)]
*  being magnanimous [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1449.28s)]
*  uh... [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1450.9399999999998s)]
*  has the israeli strikes [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1452.78s)]
*  uh... and maybe this is outside your portfolio but uh... [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1457.02s)]
*  so in some places i have read that the strikes have been [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1461.22s)]
*  do not seem to have [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1466.6s)]
*  a strategy [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1469.02s)]
*  that one that would take if one was looking for regime change in that it [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1470.82s)]
*  they have been [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1477.5s)]
*  they have hit in [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1479.22s)]
*  through more popular places in iran [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1482.02s)]
*  uh... that they haven't been necessarily focused on [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1485.54s)]
*  taking out the week antelope as it were [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1490.68s)]
*  like to create features within because they are existing features within iranian [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1493.56s)]
*  society [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1497.86s)]
*  uh... there is a [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1498.98s)]
*  there is always been a significant uh... [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1501.5s)]
*  both reform uh... i guess [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1506.3s)]
*  movement in iran and perhaps even a [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1509.1s)]
*  uh... [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1513.0s)]
*  the counter-revolutionary one [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1514.14s)]
*  uh... [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1516.56s)]
*  uh... to [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1517.8600000000001s)]
*  and iran has a [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1519.3s)]
*  a history of both like uh... [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1521.1s)]
*  well uh... autocratic dictators but prior to that most of that uh... and [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1524.34s)]
*  the united states c i a was very involved in getting rid of most of that [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1529.18s)]
*  uh... but there is a history of [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1533.3s)]
*  of uh... some form of democracy there [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1536.3s)]
*  uh... [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1539.22s)]
*  it does not appear at least from what i've read that israel has been [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1540.12s)]
*  attempting to attack [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1544.42s)]
*  in a way that would exacerbate those features [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1546.82s)]
*  but instead has attacked in such a way [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1549.62s)]
*  that has uh... [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1552.18s)]
*  that is appealed to national that that would create a sense of nationalism [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1554.54s)]
*  within iran which uh... understandable [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1558.0600000000002s)]
*  uh... [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1560.5s)]
*  but uh... what what's your take on that [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1562.14s)]
*  it's hard to know what a [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1565.98s)]
*  uh... viable strategy to attempt regime change through airstrikes where she [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1568.7s)]
*  looked like [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1573.6200000000001s)]
*  that is not something that has succeeded [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1574.94s)]
*  uh... [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1578.3s)]
*  if you there's some recent scholarship on this [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1579.94s)]
*  so airstrikes just do not tend to be enough [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1582.5800000000002s)]
*  uh... to produce regime change [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1586.26s)]
*  now [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1588.98s)]
*  you know you could argue that uh... [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1590.78s)]
*  uh... [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1593.94s)]
*  strike and so blunt i mean it's like literally there's a force from coming [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1594.9s)]
*  from the sky [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1598.5800000000002s)]
*  and everybody is subjected to that and it creates a sort of uh... [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1599.74s)]
*  uh... it seems to me that it would create a [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1604.22s)]
*  at a tightening of national bonds [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1608.26s)]
*  from what i've seen that's what's happened [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1611.14s)]
*  uh... and i i don't i i want to be cautious about [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1613.94s)]
*  trying to sort through the empirical information [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1617.26s)]
*  but that is certainly what i would predict based on [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1620.54s)]
*  what i know about how conflicts like this [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1623.5s)]
*  how they occur and [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1627.42s)]
*  you know it's also the case that iran did not attack israel first so from an [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1629.3s)]
*  iranian perspective [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1634.54s)]
*  this looks like uh... an aggressive israeli attack on their country [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1636.42s)]
*  you know if you want to ascend if you're looking to jockey for position [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1641.0800000000002s)]

*  you know there's no clean way to try to take out a regime so israel has [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1661.7s)]

*  uh... you know trump said he spoke to latimer putin and putin offered to [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1722.74s)]
*  mediate [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1726.5s)]

*  one thing that the israelis may be thinking about [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1800.8000000000002s)]
*  uh... is you know they have a lot of success [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1803.82s)]
*  uh... and the quickest way to end the war [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1807.5s)]
*  comes to be seen as the united states [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1810.3s)]
*  providing the final strikes on iran's nuclear facilities and so that's not [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1814.1599999999999s)]
*  who says trump if you'll just order that [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1818.62s)]
*  which i don't have the capability to do [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1821.3s)]
*  then israel's willing to stop [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1823.46s)]
*  and you have a way out of this [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1825.34s)]
*  situation [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1827.44s)]

*  uh... there's at least a decent chance that trump would uh... would agree to [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1831.88s)]
*  that and hope that iran backs down and doesn't retaliate directly against the [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1835.2800000000002s)]
*  united states [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1839.64s)]

*  would not retaliate in how [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1846.5800000000002s)]

*  hard to say it depends [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1861.84s)]
*  how weekend iran has been and whether it just needs [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1864.1599999999999s)]
*  a timeout [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1867.4399999999998s)]

*  uh... it's really hard to imagine that iran rethinks its entire [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1871.1999999999998s)]
*  foreign policy [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1876.12s)]
*  from there and decides that [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1877.48s)]
*  it should just focus on building [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1879.62s)]
*  it's [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1881.6799999999998s)]

*  you know decide that [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1888.26s)]
*  it had been struck uh... for just reasons this is not the way states [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1889.8s)]
*  behave this is not consistent with what we see from iran [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1894.0s)]
*  for a long time [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1897.9199999999998s)]
*  so [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1900.84s)]
*  i then worry about [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1901.96s)]
*  getting off to the races uh... with a new round of [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1903.8s)]

*  uh... it does not look like uh... [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1915.18s)]
*  what happens from here and is necessarily going to be positive unless [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkiOCOepV3c&t=1917.96s)]
