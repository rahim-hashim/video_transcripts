# Netanyahu Confirms Trump’s “Official” Plan To Ethnically Cleanse Gaza
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E)
*  Seth in Hollywood says, Emma, please keep pushing on or I would think you mean pulling, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=0.0s)]
*  pulling on that thread about the number of Palestinians Trump throughout the other day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=4.8s)]
*  It's not about believing him. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=8.0s)]
*  It's that the 1.7 to 1.8 million is such a narrow and specific range. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=9.56s)]
*  Trump doesn't pull a number like 1.7 out of his ass. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's my hypothesis at this current moment is that, you know, Trump is just so [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=17.0s)]
*  such a dummy and so undisciplined that he may have accidentally let slip the intelligence [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=21.32s)]
*  that they have about how many Palestinians have been slaughtered because the deficit [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=27.779999999999998s)]
*  between the 2.3 million that were previously cited and the 1.7 to 1.8 million that he cites [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=31.66s)]
*  at least 500,000. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=37.22s)]
*  I can believe it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=39.62s)]
*  We know that it is north of 180,000 according, I guess that was to the UN. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=41.08s)]
*  And then in October, there were there was a group of 99 American doctors, nurses, medical [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=47.58s)]
*  workers that wrote to the White House and said that they could confirm that it was at [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=54.04s)]
*  least 118,000. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=58.72s)]
*  And again, that was in October. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=59.72s)]
*  So like this figure that is continuously cited by the mainstream press right now is around [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=62.2s)]
*  48,000. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=66.52s)]
*  And it's such a wild undercount that it's essentially insulting. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=67.52s)]
*  And I mean, more than insulting. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=71.52s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=74.16s)]
*  They've killed all of the record keepers and they've destroyed every piece of infrastructure. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=75.16s)]
*  So there's no way to know if this finger is connected to the family member that has been [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=79.74s)]
*  incinerated or just blown apart by Israel's massive bombs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=86.66s)]
*  And yeah, this is honestly the honestly the fact that they stick with that number completely [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=91.33999999999999s)]
*  to me proves their bullshit from earlier when this all first this most recent attack from [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=98.58s)]
*  you know, in Gaza on the Palestinians began because at first they refused to cite any [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=107.02s)]
*  numbers that came from the Hamas led medical institutions there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=113.74s)]
*  And the reason they're still sticking with that number is because that's the only number [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=120.58s)]
*  that the Hamas led institution has been able to provide because they don't have the resources [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=125.94s)]
*  to actually continue any sort of count. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=132.82s)]
*  But that's the number that's still going by. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=135.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=137.7s)]
*  And, you know, Trump, as I covered in our conversation with Zachary Foster, endorsed [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=138.7s)]
*  the ethnic cleansing of Gaza right next to right next to Netanyahu as he grinned, essentially [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=145.82s)]
*  saying why would they want to go back there? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  And he said that the United States should take over Gaza. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=156.06s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=160.06s)]
*  Now, this could just be him not understanding that he means our proxies, the Israelis will [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=161.58s)]
*  go and reoccupy Gaza like they had previously in history, or he's actually in favor of it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=167.66s)]
*  Either way, this was such an exciting development for the Hitler of our time that he went on [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=176.86s)]
*  Fox News to talk about it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=184.18s)]
*  His grand plans for extermination are well underway. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=187.10000000000002s)]
*  Oh, he talked about that America would go in, dismantle the dangerous unexploded bombs, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=191.10000000000002s)]
*  level the site, rid the rid the site of destroyed buildings and create an economic development [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=198.18s)]
*  that would simply supply unlimited jobs, housing for people in the area and really make it [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=204.58s)]
*  a place for living in. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  Is that anything you expected? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=213.5s)]
*  And do you share that belief? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  And what do you make of American media taking that? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=217.1s)]
*  He's taking over Gaza. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=219.22s)]
*  He sounds like he's rebuilding Gaza to me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=220.89999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well, I don't think he talked about sending US troops to complete the job of destroying [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=225.1s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=229.5s)]
*  That's our commitment. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=230.7s)]
*  That's our job, and we're absolutely committed to it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=232.06s)]
*  And I also don't think he said that he's going to fund it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=234.82s)]
*  He said that neighboring states, wealthy states, would do it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=237.5s)]
*  But the actual idea of allowing first Gazans who want to leave to leave. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=241.62s)]
*  I mean, what's wrong with that? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=245.98000000000002s)]
*  They can leave, they can then come back, they can relocate and come back. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=248.10000000000002s)]
*  But you have to rebuild Gaza. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=251.62s)]
*  If you want to rebuild Gaza, you can't have this is the first good idea that I've heard. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=253.34s)]
*  It's a remarkable idea. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=259.54s)]
*  And I think it should be really pursued, examined, pursued and done, because I think it will [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=261.02000000000004s)]
*  create a different future for everyone. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=267.22s)]
*  You know, they can come back a different future for everyone. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=268.74s)]
*  They can come back, they can come back, but they can be our to do labor for us. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=271.22s)]
*  Just like they could come back after they spend a little bit of time in Gaza for being [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=275.26000000000005s)]
*  expelled in 1948. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=278.66s)]
*  They can come back, they can come back and they can be our servants. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=280.66s)]
*  Just like a handful. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=284.54s)]
*  The rest of them, they die. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  They can behave once and serve drinks. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=287.46000000000004s)]
*  The way he talks about Gaza, as there's footage of the destruction in the passive voice, I [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=291.18s)]
*  mean, it's destroyed. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  We have to we have to take them out. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=299.86s)]
*  We have to take them out. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=301.58s)]
*  So we shouldn't go down there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=302.58s)]
*  We have to take them out so that we can rebuild it and we can make it into a Trump casino [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=304.58s)]
*  and we can have Jared Kushner. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=309.14s)]
*  When he says taxpayer money isn't going towards it, do you know what he means? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=311.46s)]
*  He means capitalist real estate developer money is going to go towards it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=314.18s)]
*  And so, hey, Tel Aviv, you can go to a nightclub there and maybe a few miles away, there are [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=317.62s)]
*  people getting slaughtered in an open air concentration camp. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=322.98s)]
*  But now new Gaza, Gaza City, a bunch of nightclubs, Mediterranean. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=326.06s)]
*  You can buy some you can have some Israeli food there. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=332.54s)]
*  I also like how they're presenting it's like it's like a new idea, like, oh, maybe we should [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=336.98s)]
*  try ethnically cleansing the area. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=340.78s)]
*  We haven't like we haven't heard that one yet. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=342.42s)]
*  Yeah, I know. Right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=345.42s)]
*  And we haven't heard, oh, temporary. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=347.26s)]
*  They can come back. They can come back. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=348.94s)]
*  Yeah, sure. They can. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=350.62s)]
*  They've been trying to temporarily relocate them to Jordan and Egypt since they started [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=352.3s)]
*  massacring them. But those countries are right to not want to just allow for like mass [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=357.94s)]
*  displacement of the Palestinian people because they know that they will not be allowed to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=364.58s)]
*  go back, which is exactly what they're trying to prevent from happening. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=368.3s)]
*  They're trying to prevent from, you know, this genocide to be completed. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=372.3s)]
*  Right. Like, ultimately, I think that's what, you know, Trump, I imagine, wants the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=375.86s)]
*  conflict to be over. But in his mind, ending it can just mean that like the genocide [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=380.78s)]
*  is complete. Right. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=386.34s)]
*  I love how I love how all of a sudden he sounds so for a free moving Palestinian people. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=387.82s)]
*  You know, they're not allowed to leave or enter Gaza without permission from Israel or [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=393.5s)]
*  Egypt. And all of a sudden now, Netanyahu is about, oh, they can go over what they'd [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=398.73999999999995s)]
*  like. Leave. Come back. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=404.29999999999995s)]
*  Enjoy yourself. What? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=406.46s)]
*  That's the first time I ever heard that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=408.7s)]
*  Yeah. And Zach and our interview was talking and reminding me that if you leave Gaza for [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=410.02000000000004s)]
*  more than three years, you're literally not allowed to come back. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=415.18s)]
*  They revoke your status and your ability to live there because Israel controls Gaza [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=418.14000000000004s)]
*  because it's a part of greater Israel. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  It is a part of the Israeli state, except that they just concentrate the Palestinians [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=427.26s)]
*  there and slaughter them. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=431.26s)]
*  And then the West Bank is a ghetto that is solely being incremented by the Israeli [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=432.78000000000003s)]
*  is solely being encroached upon and land is being stolen from. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=439.22s)]
*  And that is also the next frontier here. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=442.42s)]
*  And the other part of greater Israel, that is the big prize. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=445.18s)]
*  A yeah, they write to the they can return stuff is just a mockery of things that I [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=448.98s)]
*  saw so many commentators except as just, oh, we can't do a right of return for all the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=454.14000000000004s)]
*  refugees displaced in 48 or 73. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=460.58000000000004s)]
*  They're just going to have to live with that because Israel's security concerns are [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=465.46s)]
*  more imperative than international law. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=470.14s)]
*  Why people are anti-Zionists and think that the whole thing of like Israel has a right [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=473.66s)]
*  to exist. If Israel means the maintenance and construction using brutal methods of a [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=479.14s)]
*  Jewish demographic majority, then it does not have the right to exist. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=487.34000000000003s)]
*  That is an ethnic sort of like just a clear powder keg for what we've seen for 75 [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=492.22s)]
*  years. You cannot do it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=501.3s)]
*  You can or you cannot do it without genocide and ethnic cleansing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=503.38s)]
*  And so all this stuff we talk about, like a one democratic state, Israel is finally [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=508.46000000000004s)]
*  going to do us the favor of specifying where exactly its borders are. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=513.0600000000001s)]
*  And guess what? They're going to try to include Gaza. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=517.5s)]
*  The West Bank already include the Golan Heights. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=520.3s)]
*  The problem is all of the people that live there that they don't want to give the vote [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=522.34s)]
*  to. So it is an apartheid state. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=525.86s)]
*  And again, we're going to go through this next phase of, well, but doesn't Israel have [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=528.06s)]
*  the right to exist? Not like this. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=532.78s)]
*  No. As a one democratic state with Palestinians having full rights, which means that [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=534.62s)]
*  they might outnumber Jews there. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=539.8199999999999s)]
*  Right. Guess what? That's just something that like you have to deal with as a settler [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=541.74s)]
*  colonial state. Sorry. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=545.74s)]
*  You want to live in an area where is majority Arab, majority Muslim. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=546.98s)]
*  You don't get to be the demographic majority. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=551.54s)]
*  Sorry. And any Israelis Israelis that have a problem with that leave. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=553.82s)]
*  And someone just pointed that I did not know. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=558.22s)]
*  I did not see this. Ski by Bibi says, did you see that Netanyahu gifted Trump a [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=561.46s)]
*  golden pager? F-ing gross. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=568.7s)]

*  He plated a pager in gold. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=576.46s)]
*  Can we put this up? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=579.54s)]
*  Was his press with both hands and then President Donald J. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=582.42s)]
*  Trump, our greatest friend and greatest ally, and he did it in his favorite color. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=585.5s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=590.94s)]
*  This is a reference to the Jerry rigged pagers that has I mean, they. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=592.82s)]
*  Wait, is he trying to is he trying to take out Trump now, too? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=599.62s)]
*  Yeah, right. Right. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=601.98s)]
*  I mean, is this an inside job? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=603.18s)]
*  We you know, that's that's too much. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=608.3s)]
*  I mean, Trump apparently reportedly Trump did say that if I ran [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=611.9399999999999s)]
*  takes me out or something, I want war with Iran. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=617.8599999999999s)]
*  He said I left instructions. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=621.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Like the book of Henry. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=623.18s)]
*  If you are someone who wants war with Iran, I can't think of a better way [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=625.9799999999999s)]
*  than to make that happen, then to make it look like I ran, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=630.98s)]

*  I mean, what are you? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=635.22s)]
*  They were trying to blame Iran. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=636.38s)]
*  Here's the beginning of that. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=639.1s)]
*  They were trying to blame Iran with the assassination attempts in Pennsylvania. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=640.54s)]
*  And it was just like a lone wolf white kid. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=644.58s)]
*  I mean, there there is there is there is like an insane right wing [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=648.54s)]
*  like Zionist group going around to pro-Palestine activists [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=652.18s)]
*  and handing them pagers right now. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=656.9s)]
*  Like that's what they're doing. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=659.2199999999999s)]

*  B.E.T.A.R. That is the exact same youth movement that Einstein [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=665.54s)]
*  said was the Hitler youth of our people. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59nez8noO4E&t=670.2199999999999s)]
