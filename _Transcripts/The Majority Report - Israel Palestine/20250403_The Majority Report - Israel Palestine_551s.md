# Rubio: Due Process Of The Law Doesn’t Matter
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo)
*  I assume you guys played the footage from Somerville mass, right? That's the footage is incredibly chilling to watch these cops come up. Well, not cops, these ICE guys. And incidentally, you don't have the same responsibilities in terms of like obeying an ICE agent as you would a cop. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=0.0s)]
*  Particularly, obviously, if you're a citizen, if you're not a citizen, there's a lot more vulnerability. But understand that these people are going to be they're going to do whatever they want to do in that moment. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=30.0s)]
*  Let's go to this Marco Rubio clip that is in the chat 1229. We heard a lot about and we've seen now multiple reports of the people who were shipped down to this El Salvador Gulag. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=44.0s)]
*  Not being but in one instance, a legal being a legal refugee in this country. We now have seen instances of people having a tattoo that was in support of autism awareness getting shipped down. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=61.0s)]
*  We have heard reports of women and non Venezuelans being shipped down there. And, you know, in El Salvador, they only agreed to take Venezuelans into this Gulag. So they were shipped back up. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=82.0s)]
*  Human trafficking. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=96.0s)]
*  All of these people obviously received no due process. So we don't know if any of them were, you know, gang members. Never aside from the fact that just being in a gang in and of itself is not a crime. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=98.0s)]
*  There is a wide berth for whom they can deport, but it is supposed to be done with due process. Here is Marco Rubio finally admitting what everybody has known now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=118.0s)]
*  And certainly most rational people suspected early on, which is that they don't know who was on those planes. They have a good guess at some of them, but we don't know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=130.0s)]
*  All right. Secretary Rubio, when you and President Bukele, you mentioned Trenderagua several times. When you and President Bukele negotiated the deal to transfer the US deportees to his prison in Secoz, did you discuss any provisions to ensure that individuals mistakenly identified as gang members would have access to legal recourse or that they can secure the release if they are wrong and wrong? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=148.0s)]
*  Yeah, we have that list was carefully vetted, provided to us by Homeland Security. We have confidence in it. What we negotiated is the reality that they in El Salvador comply with all the national international requirements for imprisonment. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=169.0s)]
*  So we sent them people with a combination of people, gang members, people we knew were involved in activities that were not productive to the United States, all of them removable in terms of our laws. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=185.0s)]
*  All of them. Every single one of them was someone who was removable from the United States, the respective and MS-13 members, some of them, many of whom are Salvadoran that we had identified as MS-13 members that they had helped us identify as well. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=195.0s)]
*  And that is a combination of people that we sent and you know, we may send more. We'll see. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=208.0s)]
*  A combination. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=216.0s)]
*  He's trying to cover. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=217.0s)]
*  Medley. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=219.0s)]
*  I mean, he's trying to cover here. And we don't know the absence of due process for these people means that we don't know if they were removable. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=220.0s)]
*  It is the case that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=233.0s)]
*  The United States government has the right, broadly speaking, to deport a lot of people. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=237.0s)]
*  If they are not citizens. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=245.0s)]
*  But we don't know who these people are because there was absolutely no attempt to decipher who they were, except for the fact that they had a tattoo. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=248.0s)]
*  Tattoo. This is the example that we were just citing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=259.0s)]
*  Mother Jones. Good reporting here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=263.0s)]
*  One of the men renditioned to El Salvador is Nero Alvarado, who was working in Dallas as a baker. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=265.0s)]
*  An ICE agent told him they were questioning all men with tattoos. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=272.0s)]
*  Neri had an autism awareness tattoo in honor of his 15 year old brother with autism. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=276.0s)]
*  That's who they're referring to there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=283.0s)]
*  An ICE agent told him we're finding and questioning everyone who has tattoos, and that's why he was arrested stunningly. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=285.0s)]
*  Aaron Melnick says in this thread after Neri explained his autism tattoos, meaning the ICE agent said he was clean and yet he was still detained and got sent to El Salvador. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=292.0s)]
*  They got quotas they want to hit. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=302.0s)]
*  That's it. That's it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=303.0s)]
*  They don't care if they're gang members. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=305.0s)]
*  That's the other thing is like this is about a show of shock and awe of force, a way to scare people. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=307.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean that more isn't coming, but it means that it's almost better, I think, for their purposes. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=316.0s)]
*  Because or honestly, Stephen Miller, whoever is behind this, probably likes the idea that innocent people are around that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=322.0s)]
*  He doesn't think the idea he doesn't think you could possibly be innocent if you're just here in this country on a green card or without proper documentation because he's a white nationalist. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=332.0s)]
*  Here's the other thing to keep in mind. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=344.0s)]
*  What's really impressive is how incredibly dangerous these trend to Agua and these MS 13 people that allegedly are in the US are. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=346.0s)]
*  Trend to Agua and these MS 13 people that allegedly these gang members are who were rounded up and shipped to El Salvador. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=356.0s)]
*  Very fortunate for these ICE officers that there was no absolute like seem seemingly no resistance, no gunfighting. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=366.0s)]
*  Invaders after all. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=376.0s)]
*  I mean, these invasions were just basically walked into these jails and were led to believe. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=378.0s)]
*  And the Venezuelan immigrants, many of them came into this country because the economy fell apart in part because of the United States sanctions on it as we were trying to do like a soft coup in that country to put Guaido in as leader. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=384.0s)]
*  Chris Murphy called it a coup. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=399.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=401.0s)]
*  All right. I forgot that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=402.0s)]
*  We can just do that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=403.0s)]
*  And then we wonder why all these people are displaced and it must be because they want to invade us because they hate us and our freedoms. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=404.0s)]
*  And they're terrorists and criminals or as opposed to just people trying to seek a better life for themselves. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=411.0s)]
*  And cops in this country have done this before and under served communities. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=417.0s)]
*  They basically said they had gang ties as a way to to to drum up charges against somebody else, particularly black people in this country. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=425.0s)]
*  This is federalizing that practice. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=434.0s)]
*  And it's about terrorizing a neighborhood. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=437.0s)]
*  And this in this instance, it's just terrorizing an entire population. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=439.0s)]
*  Another day, another Trump attack on basic freedoms, this time targeting Palestinian activist and green card holder Mahmoud Khalil helped lead the Columbia University protests. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=443.0s)]
*  But if you go to ground.news majority, you're going to see how some outlets paint him as a radical threat, while others call out Trump's crackdown on dissent. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=453.0s)]
*  The story hasn't changed, but the way it's told is completely changes your perspective. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=464.0s)]
*  The exact problem our partners at ground news solve. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=468.0s)]
*  If you like my show, you'll love how their app and website let you compare coverage from across the spectrum with context on how political bias, financial incentives and even blind spots shape the narrative, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=472.0s)]
*  especially with so much of our media being driven by billionaire and political agendas. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=484.0s)]
*  Propaganda has become one of the most powerful weapons today. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=488.0s)]
*  But ground news is independent and nonpartisan, only committed to helping us think critically on the news, shaping everything from public opinion to policy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=492.0s)]
*  And since I can't cover every single attack on our rights, I've curated feeds that track key issues and trusted sources. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=501.0s)]
*  This way, I know I'm bringing my viewers reliable information. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=507.0s)]
*  Go to ground.news majority or scan my QR code to see it in action for yourself. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=511.0s)]
*  Because this story is bigger than just one activist being detained, it's about how media bias controls what you see and think. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=518.0s)]
*  My viewers get the same unlimited access vantage plan that I use for nearly half the cost, knocking the price down to just five bucks a month. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=525.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPou4aZ6JTo&t=548.0s)]
