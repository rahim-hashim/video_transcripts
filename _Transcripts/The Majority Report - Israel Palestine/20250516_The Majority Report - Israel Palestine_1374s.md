# Netanyahu Toying With Trump
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU)
*  What's been your bad Hasbra, everybody should check it out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=0.0s)]
*  I really had such a great time when I was on with you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=3.2s)]
*  I mean, maybe that must have been like a year ago at this point. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  But what's been your experience covering this over the like over the first 100 days of Donald Trump? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=9.36s)]
*  I mean, activism for Palestine, it's it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=17.52s)]
*  I mean, it's not harder. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=22.32s)]
*  The struggle is always difficult, of course. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  But you have a completely untethered, unhinged administration, and there's been no food [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=26.48s)]
*  that has gotten into Gaza in food, water or medicine in 60 days. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=32.56s)]
*  And it feels like we're adding one of the most dangerous points in the genocide. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=38.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, in terms of the first 100 days of the Trump administration and everything that's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=43.92s)]
*  gone on with the genocide since it's been it's gone kind of exactly how I thought it was going [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=50.88s)]
*  to go and how it was supposed to have gone this whole time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=60.24s)]
*  You have the PR ceasefire, essentially a win for the Trump administration right off the bat. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  And it existed, I think primarily so that Trump could have this, you know, easy runway for his [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=74.56s)]
*  first 100 days that Israel couldn't help but break almost immediately. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=84.64s)]
*  They and and and I knew as soon as they did, you know, all of this talk of like, oh, you know, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=89.36s)]
*  they had, you know, people go into Netanyahu and saying, you better do a ceasefire, you know, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=95.12s)]
*  Trump wants one, you're going to do one. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  And then as soon as they broke it, they were like, OK, are you guys going to kill everyone? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  That's fine. What do you need? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=106.64s)]
*  And it was just it was it's so clear. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=108.24s)]
*  I mean, you know, all of the for all of the talk about, you know, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  how terrible, you know, the Democrats are, which they are, you know, they were they lost this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  election because they could not admit to themselves or the American people that this was, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  you know, a genocide. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=130.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, they lost for a ton of reasons, but I think that is a big part of it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=132.0s)]
*  Huge. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=137.04s)]
*  And and they they ceded that ground to Trump to where he was going out and pretending like he was [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=137.44s)]
*  a dove. It was completely like ridiculous. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=144.64s)]
*  Like people were like he could say that because they were out there, you know, being like we got [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=147.28s)]
*  to make sure that Israel has everything they need in order to do genocide. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=154.48s)]
*  So anyways, the Hizbarah around that has been interesting because you've seen kind of a split, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=158.32s)]
*  whereas I feel like the more liberal Zionist PR spin was kind of, I would say, the mainstay [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  of the Biden administration. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=173.68s)]
*  Now you are seeing the PR go full Baitar. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=175.68s)]
*  And if you don't know what Baitar is, it's this very right wing Zionist organization that is [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=180.4s)]
*  like they think they think the ADL are Hamas. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=188.32s)]
*  Like that's how psychopathic they are. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=191.76s)]
*  And Jonathan Greenblatt, I mean, he's obviously anti-Semitic. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=195.12s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=198.56s)]
*  I mean, you know, he is he just doesn't know he is. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=200.0s)]
*  Yes. Like future Hamas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  He's future anti-Semite. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  We just, you know. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  Yes. But like it is it is wild just watching kind of, you know, for his mask off as Israel has been. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  It's wild to watch like, oh, shit, I didn't know there was more mask. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=217.6s)]
*  Like they keep removing extra parts of the mask. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=222.64s)]
*  And I'm like, Jesus, at what point? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=226.16s)]
*  Like Netanyahu just recently said, like, we prioritize the destruction of, quote, Hamas [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  over bringing back our civilians. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=236.4s)]
*  Like he is saying that out loud, which is a wild thing to say when you can just infer it [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  using your brain. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=246.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=248.16s)]
*  Like, just look what's happened for the last 18 months. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=249.2s)]
*  We know that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=251.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=253.04s)]
*  You don't have to know he gets off on it in like the way that when Trump, they did that press [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=253.36s)]
*  conference and Trump was saying who would want to live there? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=258.0s)]
*  It's destroyed sitting next to the man who is responsible for the destruction. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=261.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=265.6s)]
*  He's smiling because they think they're they're doing a little bit of a trick, like in the same [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=265.76s)]
*  way that they messed with the Biden administration, who was not earnestly pursuing a ceasefire, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=271.92s)]
*  but they wanted better PR for themselves at the very least. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=277.76s)]
*  The Netanyahu was toying with him in that way, too. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=281.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=285.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=286.32s)]
*  It is. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=286.8s)]
*  It is. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  It's wild to see. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the repression has obviously gotten even more insane, but, you know, it's I kind [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=289.36s)]
*  of see it all as a continuation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=299.12s)]
*  You know, it's this was like the logical endpoint of what the, you know, Democrats have allowed [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=300.96s)]
*  to happen, essentially. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's why when I see like Cory Booker, fucking Hakeem Jeffries, like any of these [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  like centrist Dems who are talking about deportations, I'm just like, you set up the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=322.96s)]
*  dominoes. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=333.52s)]
*  The idea that you're just like, who would who I didn't think you guys are going to knock them [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  down. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=340.24s)]
*  You know, yeah, I just thought it was like, wow, look at all these dominoes all next to each [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=341.28s)]
*  other. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  I thought we were just going to look at it and enjoy like, you know, I can't I can't take any [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  of them seriously. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=350.96s)]
*  And I can't take anyone seriously, honestly, the Democratic Party who doesn't, you know, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  full throatedly ask for, you know, the not only no weapons to Israel, but also a complete [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=359.12s)]
*  isolation of it as if it were apartheid South Africa, because it is but worse. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=366.56s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's our our old producer Bradley referred one time to to Cory Booker's having a Winnie the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  Pooh disposition. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=379.6s)]
*  And I think about that often with him and it's when he had a psychopathic will to power from [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=380.72s)]
*  like teenage years, right? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  Or like or not even the disposition. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=388.32000000000005s)]
*  It's more like his the way he presents politically. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=389.92s)]
*  And it's like, why are you wearing the the pin that's meant to like falsely link the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  genocide to the return of the hostages as you talk about like the dangers of authoritarianism? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  It's so hard to talk about authoritarianism in 2025 and for like a whole day and not [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  mention Israel and what we're doing one time. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=409.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=411.84s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  That's well, it's why liberal Zionists are fascist enablers. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=412.56s)]
*  And I think that's like a really important way for us to refer to them, because we wouldn't [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=416.4s)]
*  have this, as you say, the situation that we're in without this permission structure [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=421.76s)]
*  being created by many, many Democrats. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  What is like just to zoom out about some of how liberal Zionists are reacting, like maybe [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=430.4s)]
*  even in your life, because we've talked about this on your show, too, how there was [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=437.28s)]
*  outrage for probably like four or five months of like, I don't know, me getting [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=442.96s)]
*  freezed out, maybe you a little bit by some people after October 7th. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=447.76s)]
*  I'm an anti-Semite, whatever. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=452.4s)]
*  Then we have, OK, like tensions begin to cool, maybe not from my end, because I'm [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  infuriated by these people like justifying this. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  Like, there's now been, I think, maybe around six to eight months of these folks that were [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=464.0s)]
*  saying anybody speaking out for Palestine or anti-Semitic, it's just radio silence. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=470.0s)]
*  It feels like that's maybe even a longer period of that, where it's like they just these [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  people who were very vocal about the anti-Semitism in the pro-Palestine movement are just like [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  quiet. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=486.64s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=488.0s)]
*  Is there any self-reflection happening in your experience? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  I, you know, I've been shocked by the lack of self-reflection. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=492.4s)]
*  Like that truly, it's almost like a feat. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=497.44s)]
*  It amazes me the amount of people I know who still have not, I don't know, like [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=500.16s)]
*  apologized to me. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=509.44s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to be waiting until the end of my life. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=511.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's like it's just for the reactions. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=513.76s)]
*  And like the worst thing that I've seen has been a like very intense revisionism with a lot of [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=517.0400000000001s)]
*  these liberal Zionists where they'll start saying things like, you know, oh, well, everyone, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=526.64s)]
*  everyone wanted a ceasefire. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=534.48s)]
*  We all wanted a ceasefire. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=535.76s)]
*  You know, it's like who doesn't want to ceasefire? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=537.44s)]
*  We agree that they're being genocidal. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=540.24s)]
*  They won't say genocide, but they'll say they're being genocidal. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=542.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I love to be murderous and not do murdering. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=545.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=550.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=551.36s)]
*  Just just just for, you know, for a treat. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=551.84s)]
*  But like they would straight up start like calling me or my wife anti-Semitic for saying the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=554.8800000000001s)]
*  word ceasefire in like, you know, obviously October, November, December, 2023 up until like [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=563.2800000000001s)]
*  May of 2024. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=570.72s)]
*  Just the anyone saying ceasefire, it was synonymous with being like a Hamas supporting anti-Semite. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=573.44s)]
*  Now, I swear to God, I've seen people who are straight up just they're guffawing at anyone who [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=581.12s)]
*  ever said ceasefire because they're like, yeah, we all wanted to ceasefire. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=589.0400000000001s)]
*  Everyone is doing the thing where they're going to revise everything that they said beforehand. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=592.48s)]
*  They're going to they're going to change the goalposts as to what they cared about while [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=597.6s)]
*  simultaneously remaining firmly in the camp of well, Israel's got to do what Israel's got to do. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=602.64s)]
*  They will find whatever way to defend it that they can. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=609.52s)]
*  And in my life, it's been, you know, for the most part, people who are, you know, who at one point [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=613.6s)]
*  may have been like yelling at me about stuff, texting me insane propaganda. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=622.0s)]
*  Now, you know, they still don't talk to me, but they will like post like, man, you know, this [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=628.72s)]
*  Donald Trump, he is a bad guy. He's a bad dude. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=635.44s)]
*  And I'm just like, you have no right to talk about anything. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=639.28s)]
*  If you have you spent the first, what, 14 months of genocide, actively supporting it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  And now you're just like, you know, this Donald Trump guy, you know, I don't know about him. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=654.4000000000001s)]
*  You know, I think he's bad. We all need to band together. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=658.64s)]
*  It's just like, no, F off. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=661.36s)]
*  I do you think that that is like really for me, there's this navel gazing element of which we're [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=663.76s)]
*  all guilty of. I mean, like you have to have a healthy ego to put your face on camera and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=670.96s)]
*  talk to it. So I'm not excluding myself from. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=674.88s)]
*  We all gaze at Navel's. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=678.96s)]
*  But like the thing that's been most difficult, I think, to fight through with some of the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=682.8000000000001s)]
*  liberal Zionists is just like, I vote Democrat. So I am a good person. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=689.2800000000001s)]
*  I have like these very set viewpoints about like racism, but it's only in a domestic context. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=694.48s)]
*  I don't want to think about our foreign policy. I don't want to think about capitalism and its [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=701.36s)]
*  role in, you know, immiserating people in the global south and the Middle East. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=705.6s)]
*  Just like that is also a part of our racist worldwide structure where, like I don't, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=711.04s)]
*  the idea that the greatest barrier for you to oppose one of the greatest crimes in the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=718.72s)]
*  history of humanity that we're currently currently living through is your own personal [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=723.52s)]
*  like narcissism about how good you are. Yeah. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=729.12s)]
*  Is there anything more privileged than that very notion? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=733.76s)]
*  Right. Yeah. No, I mean, mad. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=738.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it is. It's insane. The amount of, you know, how much Zionism does come from being [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=741.04s)]
*  completely self-centered, but like just or how much fascism just comes from being completely [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=748.32s)]
*  self-centered. It's especially, I think it's when it's, you know, like when it's liberals, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=754.32s)]
*  it's always worse because it comes from this deeply insecure part of their psyche that defines [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=760.72s)]
*  like goodness by the perception of goodness. You know, it defines morality by the perception [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=771.2s)]
*  of they themselves being moral. And so whatever decision they make, whatever position they hold [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=777.68s)]
*  must be moral because they are moral. They're like, I'm good. So everything I think good. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=787.1999999999999s)]
*  And it's like this really like baby brain thing where you realize how many liberals are just [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=793.04s)]
*  essentially conservatives and waiting because the inability to learn, the inability to self-reflect [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=797.76s)]
*  is like, you know, it's like the classic like conservative stereotype. And you just, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=804.16s)]
*  you know, people always wonder, it's like, you know, how come, you know, the youth, they start [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=810.48s)]
*  out liberal, then they go conservative. And it's like, well, it's yeah, because a lot of liberalism [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=814.56s)]
*  is just, you know, completely superficial. It's not actually about learning anything or believing [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=818.7199999999999s)]
*  in anything. It is about, you know, feeling good about yourself. And then as soon as something [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=824.8s)]
*  affects you personally, that's why it's always starts with like taxes. Right. Or someone will [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=831.6s)]
*  just be like, you know, I used to believe in like, you know, gay marriage and stuff, but then I had [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=836.16s)]
*  to pay $10,000 to the IRS. And now I'll pretty much throw anyone under the bus in order to, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=841.9200000000001s)]
*  you know, in order to get that money back. Yeah. And I mean, even like you see it here, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=848.32s)]
*  especially on the the East Coast with the salt deduction fight, like the same people that were [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=854.32s)]
*  obsessed with this is just like a more upper middle class deduction that is in blue states that [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=859.36s)]
*  primarily like was that Trump eliminated the first time. It's a taxation deductions called the salt, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=866.16s)]
*  the state and local tax deduction. And the there's a fight, you know, with like the Josh Gottheimer [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=874.0s)]
*  and the conservative Democrats and then the moderate Mike Lawler Republicans are want to [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=882.8000000000001s)]
*  bring back the salt deduction. But Trump initially used it as a way to punish blue states. And I just [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=887.92s)]
*  see this like all liberal Zionists are all like you ask them about taxes and they're like, God, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=892.9599999999999s)]
*  you know, I hate Trump because of that salt deduction thing. Oh, you hate Trump now because [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=898.24s)]
*  he made your taxes go up by like a small amount. Yeah, that it is. It is like it is crazy. The [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  amount of this is why it's so funny to talk to a liberal Zionist because I enjoy hearing it's like, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=911.6s)]
*  so what do you care about? Because that's always fascinating to me to be able to compartmentalize [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=918.32s)]
*  like it used to be you were compartmentalizing something that was, you know, like without doing [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=924.32s)]
*  any further reading, you could just assume Israel good. You know, it was like, especially if you were, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=931.84s)]
*  you know, grew up loving Israel or thinking Israel was, you know, belong to you because of, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=938.0s)]
*  you know, past Jewish trauma and whatnot. But now like, you know, genocide happening and to be able [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=944.56s)]
*  to compartmentalize that and still be like, you know, complaining about the salt tax like that's [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=952.56s)]
*  that's incredible to me. It's like I want to I want to like dive into that brain and swim around [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=959.76s)]
*  for a bit. Yeah, just want to see what other little pockets of weird shit you've been like [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=964.48s)]
*  suppressing. I should correct myself. It's Trump cap to the salt deduction. So it limited it to [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=968.88s)]
*  you couldn't do, you know, tens of thousands of dollars. It was that 10k. Yeah, 10,000. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=974.16s)]
*  But that's just one example I can think of. But um, but yeah, I mean, even in deportations and [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=979.44s)]
*  shit like that, I mean, you see the amount of like, you know, these are the same liberals who were at [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=984.48s)]
*  the anti ice protests, you know, back in what, you know, during the Trump administration, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=990.88s)]
*  the Muslim ban, they were against that 100%. And and now it's like, you know, they some of them will [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=997.04s)]
*  still, you know, march against Trump. And I'll be like, you, you have seen the amount of students [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1004.64s)]
*  they are deporting for writing essays or attending marches. You're you're attending a march. How do [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1012.0s)]
*  you live with this in your brain? It's it's it's wild. It's uh, because those marches are and it's [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1019.12s)]
*  nice to see people in the streets, but it's just about demonstrating your opposition where it comes [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1025.28s)]
*  back to the navel gazing thing. Steps into as opposed to having concrete demands, like, which [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1030.0s)]
*  is an actual threat. The pro Palestine demonstrations are about divesting from is like, very, very [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1037.2s)]
*  specific. Yeah, divest from Israel. That's what it says. And Ramesa Eztik wasn't even that it was [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1043.1999999999998s)]
*  like, hey, school, our students said divest from Israel. Listen to them. Right. Yeah, it is. It's [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1049.52s)]
*  wild. It's such a specific demand. I talked to a liberal Zionist recently who said that he was like, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1056.2399999999998s)]
*  you know, I think they shouldn't have done the encampments, all that stuff, because it's like, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1062.8799999999999s)]
*  people get annoyed by that, you know, it's like bad optics. And also it's like, what do they even want? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1066.9599999999998s)]
*  And I was like, did you not talk to anybody? They're recycling the occupy. Yes. Yes. The [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1072.16s)]
*  anti occupy critique. What do they even want? What the no, I mean, okay, I'm sorry. You cannot make [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1081.44s)]
*  that critique of these protesters. Their demands are right in front of you. Yes. Yes. It's completely [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1088.8000000000002s)]
*  ridiculous. It's on signs. It says, yes, I've asked. Yeah. Anyway, what'd you say? You want to [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1094.48s)]
*  do this? Do you have? Okay. I don't know if that's got to go. There's another Federman. I don't got [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1103.04s)]
*  shit. This is my birthday. I told my wife, I told my wife, I'm doing whatever I want today. I'm [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1109.04s)]
*  going to go on majority report. We're going to talk about Federman's weird ass. Let's go nuts. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1115.44s)]
*  We got another Federman clip here. Another time where he's seated and seemingly unaware of his [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1121.28s)]
*  surroundings this time in public or at least on an airplane. This is from a Prem talker of Zateo, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1127.44s)]
*  video from February when John Federman got in an argument with a pilot about wearing his seatbelt. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1134.16s)]
*  So it was visible. And this was cited in that extensive New York magazine piece. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1138.0s)]
*  Of course he's getting in fights with fucking flight attendants. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1144.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1147.2s)]
*  I'm depressed. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1168.56s)]
*  Bro, what are we doing? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1171.12s)]
*  The point of a seatbelt is for me to be safe. Right? I don't want to be safe. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1177.36s)]
*  I want to die. I'm trying to die. I'm thinking about my friend from grad school that died in 1993. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1185.36s)]
*  He wore a seatbelt and died anyway. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1194.0s)]
*  Would it be amazing if he was going to Israel as some sort of like death wish? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1196.0s)]
*  He just wants a Hamas rocket to fall on him so fucking bad. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1202.88s)]
*  Just walks into the sea. If he really wants to die, just hop aboard an aid flotilla. Do that [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1207.04s)]
*  if you really want to get killed. Yeah, it's so funny these like Federman videos that keep coming [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1220.32s)]
*  out and every picture of Glum Keanu met every picture of Glum Ben Affleck. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1227.36s)]
*  It's a photogenic version of always looking depressed, but I think he is actually a very, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1240.16s)]
*  very sad man, which I mean, you know, that's just called karma. I think. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1249.84s)]
*  Yeah. I'd like to ask him like, Hey, can you talk about how important joy is to your life? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1255.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Can you speak on joy? Yeah. Well, it is wild. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1260.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. He should, he should probably watch inside out. It'll help him identify his emotions. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1267.12s)]
*  That's right. That'll help. Yeah. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cQzdsdJwU&t=1272.1599999999999s)]
