# Stunning Poll Out Of Israel Will Make Your Jaw Drop
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4)
*  Let's talk a little bit about what we've seen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel seems to be completely now, I mean, it's not like they had any type of restraint [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=4.32s)]
*  before, but they are being relentless and it feels like now they have unfettered, like [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=10.68s)]
*  an unfettered lane as it were, to do this ethnic cleansing. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=21.88s)]
*  There was a poll that came out in Haaretz, I think overnight or yesterday, showing massive [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=25.7s)]
*  support for ethnic cleansing in Gaza amongst the Israeli population. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=34.18s)]
*  Trump doesn't seem to be terribly concerned about this. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=41.46s)]
*  There was a brief moment where it looked like that they had made some negotiations with [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=43.82s)]
*  maybe the Saudis or maybe the UAE was like, you got to do more for Gaza. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=50.66s)]
*  And it got him to say, there should be more food to Gaza. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=55.86s)]
*  And so the Israelis let in like half a dozen trucks, woefully insufficient to keep kids [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  from starving. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=72.02s)]
*  Fifty people killed overnight. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=77.3s)]
*  The family that we've had on from time to time who've started a bakery in Gaza and have [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=79.52s)]
*  started to attempt to do a kindergarten, they just lost nine, maybe 11 people in a drone [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=87.74s)]
*  attack last night. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=94.0s)]
*  We'll put a link to that fundraiser in the... [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=97.06s)]
*  Is that the Dardou family? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=99.64s)]
*  No, no, it is the Al-Dogma family. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=103.16s)]
*  They were killed east of Khan Yunis. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  And undoubtedly, children, I mean, it's just... [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=114.4s)]
*  Yes, it's ramping up this week. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=121.44s)]
*  And I have it as my pinned tweet right now, this comment from Bezalel Smocz, the finance [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=123.56s)]
*  minister, which is just truly extraordinary. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  I can read his quote. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=134.36s)]
*  He says, the IDF is finally conducting a campaign against the civilian rule of Hamas [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=135.68s)]
*  and not just focusing on the military infrastructure. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=141.8s)]
*  We are eliminating ministers, officials, money changers, and elements of the economic and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=145.6s)]
*  governmental system, unquote. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  And the Gaza Ministry of Health just announced that 12 ICU nurses were assassinated this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=153.8s)]
*  week, some in targeted strikes on their homes with their families. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=160.52s)]
*  The attacks on journalists and medical professionals have ramped up. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  And so Smocz is saying that it is now official Israeli policy that they're targeting civilians [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=169.28s)]
*  and the entire civilian infrastructure. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, there's no... [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=179.56s)]
*  Where is the Arab leadership? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=185.12s)]
*  I mean, where is... [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=188.60000000000002s)]
*  There seems to be no pushback. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  There seems to be, you know, short of like France and UK and Canada. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=193.6s)]
*  I mean, short of Yemen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=198.92s)]
*  No one... [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=202.83999999999997s)]
*  There doesn't seem to be any entities, sovereign entities, that are saying stop or slow or [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  anything. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=213.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=214.48s)]
*  Yeah, even the Qataris, you know, they made a lot of private comments to Trump and Witkoff. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=215.48s)]
*  But, you know, MBS sitting next to him, MBZ sitting next to him, Amir of Qatar sitting [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=223.68s)]
*  next to him and having the cameras on them. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=229.16000000000003s)]
*  None of them said a word. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=231.72000000000003s)]
*  We had David Hearst of Middle East Eye on yesterday and he wrote a piece kind of talking [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=234.68s)]
*  a little bit about that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=238.36s)]
*  The lack of support from Arab leaders in the region. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=242.56s)]
*  And this is what we kind of suspected was likely to happen with Donald Trump. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=245.56s)]
*  Maybe talking to people that the Biden administration was unwilling to do. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=250.48s)]
*  But he's talking to them so we can get cold card cash in his hands. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=256.2s)]
*  And Hearst made this point, this is a second generation of leaders in this region that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=259.84s)]
*  are more removed from Oslo and more removed from the negotiation process of the 90s. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=266.6s)]
*  And they are the kids of those people and they just care about getting rich. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=275.88s)]
*  So like, the United States via our funding these undemocratic leaders in the region, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=280.4s)]
*  we have succeeded in removing them from the will of the civilian populations that they [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  rule over. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=297.36s)]
*  And so they're kind of, they're very much like Trump, right? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=298.36s)]
*  Trump is a lot more like those guys than he is even a Benjamin Netanyahu or a Republican [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=302.44s)]
*  back here because they just care about getting wealthy via being in power. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=306.08s)]
*  Well Netanyahu is not unlike them either. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=312.52s)]
*  We just don't cover that element of it much in the Western press. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=317.44s)]
*  But yeah, Netanyahu is facing his own counter-gates. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=321.44s)]
*  He's theoretically more constrained by, theoretically more constrained by popular opinion in Israel. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=325.24s)]
*  But now we see where popular opinion in Israel is. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=331.79999999999995s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=333.79999999999995s)]
*  And you know, 70, 80% of the Israeli population now, you know, saying forced displacement [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  and ethnic cleansing, I mean, however they phrase it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  If you poll the population, they'll also say that if there's a deal to end the war and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  release all the hostages, they'll take that too. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  It's a kind of schizophrenic situation. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=356.23999999999995s)]
*  But the thing is, how is there no awareness in Israel that Hamas has offered that deal [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=358.4s)]
*  multiple occasions? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=367.4s)]
*  Yeah, for a year now. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=368.4s)]
*  Going back to May, we're going to November, like 23. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but then I question sometimes, like, you know, in polling, it's just, people aren't [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=374.08s)]
*  always honest, right? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's, like, you'll sometimes, a pollster will say, what motivated you to [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  vote for Trump or something? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=385.4s)]
*  Sometimes people will just say the economy because it sounds smart. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=387.2s)]
*  Although in this election, I definitely think, you know, the economy was the number one issue. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=390.2s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I'm just saying that Netanyahu, he's more like Dick Cheney. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  The financial interests, I think, of Trump here are, there was hope that potentially [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  this could open up a door. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  But right now, the Palestinians are just being forgotten because everybody's more focused [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  on getting rich right now. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=412.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=414.64s)]
*  And I think they would like to see this ended and be able to normalize relations, but they're [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=415.96s)]
*  not willing to take even the smallest amount of risk. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=420.84s)]
*  Associated with that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=424.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's a horror show. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4J3lovXU4&t=426.32s)]
