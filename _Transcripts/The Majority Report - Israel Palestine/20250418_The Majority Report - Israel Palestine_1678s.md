# Kids YouTube Star Smeared By Pro-Israel Groups For Gaza Aid Posts
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E)
*  Tommy V tour of crooked media of pod save America did this video talking about miss Rachel who is a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=0.0s)]
*  like [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=9.42s)]
*  wonderful [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=10.88s)]
*  children's content creator and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  A lot of parents [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=14.96s)]
*  I know some young parents who swear by her and how much she helps their kids and teaches them and allows them to learn [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=16.4s)]
*  And she's recently been creating [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=23.28s)]
*  videos for the children in Gaza and you see [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Them smiling as they watch her videos surrounded by rubble. It's like an objectively beautiful thing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=29.040000000000003s)]
*  not for the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=35.24s)]
*  Israel Israel lobby [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=36.92s)]
*  They have been putting her on a list and targeting her with harassment for daring [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=38.36s)]
*  To care about the children in Gaza and making videos for them to cheer them up [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=43.92s)]
*  Here's Tommy explaining what happened nearly every parent with young kids is sort of miss Rachel [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  She's a former teacher who makes adorable educational content for kids on YouTube her videos have gotten over 10 billion views [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=54.8s)]
*  Many of which were streamed in my house by the way, but things haven't been so happy for miss Rachel lately last week a group [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  Called stop antisemitism, which is known for doxxing students [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=66.92s)]
*  It perceives to be anti-israel and then asking people to report them to ice [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=69.92s)]
*  They called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether miss Rachel is getting paid to quote disseminate Hamas align [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=73.24s)]
*  Propaganda to her millions of followers as this may violate foreign agents registration act [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=79.38s)]
*  Allow me to unpack the many many many layers of bullshit in that sentence first of all, miss Rachel has never posted pro Hamas [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=83.92s)]
*  Propaganda not even close. She's posted images of traumatized children in the Gaza Strip [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=91.2s)]
*  She's raised over fifty thousand dollars for kids in conflict zones that includes Sudan Ukraine and yes, Gaza [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=96.04s)]
*  And she's posted about Israeli children who are being held hostage by Hamas. Do you see a through line there? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  She cares deeply about the well-being of children [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=107.76s)]
*  Second if miss Rachel or anyone else was taking money from Hamas, they wouldn't be violating the foreign agents registration act or Farah [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=110.4s)]
*  They would be working with a designated foreign terrorist organization [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  You have to register under Farah to lobby for a foreign country [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=119.56s)]
*  DOJ wouldn't greenlight you doing PR for a terrorist organization you morons third this letter [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  Which just happened to be leaked to the New York Post how convenient it suggested miss Rachel social media posts were intended to inspire [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=128.68s)]
*  Pro Hamas sympathies among young kids, but these were Instagram posts. This was not her YouTube content for kids [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=135.84s)]
*  I don't know about you [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=141.48s)]
*  But I don't know a lot of three-year-olds with Instagram accounts or opinions about the Middle East for that matter [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=142.56s)]
*  This is nothing more than an attempt to silence someone who's trying to talk about the humanity of those suffering in Gaza and the need [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=147.4s)]
*  To protect all children. It's an outgrowth of the weaponization of social media [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=153.98s)]
*  That is being used to target critics of Israeli government policies and to have those individuals deported or otherwise punished by the Trump administration [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=157.88s)]
*  Antisemitism is a real problem in this world and it has been for centuries [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=166.16s)]
*  It is absolutely critical that we call it out and we support Jews around the world who feel threatened or intimidated [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=169.62s)]
*  But this attack on miss Rachel is a cynical weaponization of a real problem for political purposes [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=175.58s)]
*  And it will ultimately make the problem worse not better [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=181.08s)]
*  So to everybody out there leave miss Rachel the hell alone or you will awaken an army of pissed-off toddlers and exhausted parents [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=184.04s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=191.16s)]
*  It's just amazing and she posted this on her social media in reaction to this [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=192.48s)]
*  Crazy harassment that Tommy did a good job of recapping there [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=198.72s)]
*  Children have human rights. These rights are not just for some children. They are for all children [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  Standing up for children, especially those who are most vulnerable is the right thing to do [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=208.64s)]
*  And you know what I hear when I hear that I hear her say [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=214.7s)]
*  You are having an emotional breakdown right now [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=218.14s)]
*  I mean come on. This is this is it though. This is emblematic. This is not like a a sort of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=220.14s)]
*  Unexpected thing. This is what the groups like stop antisemitism [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=227.26s)]
*  The anti-diffamation league a lot of these groups. They claim will claim antisemitism. What they really mean is sometimes not even [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=231.66s)]
*  Criticism of Israel. Sometimes it's just recognizing Palestinian humanity [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=239.38s)]
*  Because frankly that young kids in Palestine in Gaza is [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=243.92s)]
*  Zionists in particular see that as a demographic threat and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=249.56s)]
*  When you're just saying you should you belong in this world children [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=254.94s)]
*  You can hear some content for you to watch among the rubble that gives them [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=259.46s)]
*  That inspires life and that is something that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=265.66s)]
*  Is not something just to sit with and ponder for a second that it's actually a threat to the Israeli project for kids in Gaza [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=268.7s)]
*  To have joy and to feel hope to not be terrorized and then they conflate that with hatred [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=275.7s)]
*  Because these folks are completely disinterested in eradicating antisemitism when you take these kinds of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=281.42s)]
*  Stances that are not being used in the Israeli community [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=289.74s)]
*  In eradicating antisemitism when you take these kinds of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=293.94s)]
*  Stances and you set up doxing campaigns to target somebody who is providing joy for little children who may be amputee [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=298.42s)]
*  Amputees or who are starving in the Gaza Strip. It's been weeks plus dozens of family since yeah since [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=305.98s)]
*  Aid has been allowed in food [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=313.22s)]
*  We have no idea what the conditions are really like there and I saw some images out of the Washington Post [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=315.26s)]
*  That show children who are just skeletons like there could be kids right now wasting away [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=320.5s)]
*  it's hard for us to even discern because Israel has [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=325.1s)]
*  Killed so many journalists and media workers to make it impossible for us to understand the true death toll the true [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=329.22s)]
*  Totality of the brutality we know it's hundreds of thousands. There's folks still using this [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  40,000 50,000 60,000 figure I think even using that is misinformation [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=343.94s)]
*  Because we had doctors 99 doctors and physicians [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=348.94s)]
*  nurses medical workers who were Americans [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=353.86s)]
*  Right to Biden and Harris in October and they said at minimum the death toll is a hundred eighteen thousand [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=356.42s)]
*  Lancet a very well established medical journal also did their own analysis and I think it was over 180 K around that exact same time [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=362.9s)]
*  so we know that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=370.86s)]
*  The death toll is just absolutely out of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=373.94s)]
*  Exponentially higher than what's being reported [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=378.54s)]
*  And Israel is trying to implement their final solution as we speak [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=380.86s)]
*  So God forbid this this woman provide joy for kids there and apparently she had to take a break after this [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=385.14000000000004s)]
*  Because of all the harassment she's been facing [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=394.46000000000004s)]
*  Ryan from the loose says miss Rachel took a long break from making vids due to stress [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=396.98s)]
*  This is part of the reason she took that break my two-year-old is gonna be pissed [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=401.5s)]
*  Let's just say our parents out there, you know, you have more programming to feel [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=405.78s)]
*  You know less guilty about I mean if I was a parent [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=409.94s)]
*  I would love to find creators like that that are willing to stand up for [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=413.21999999999997s)]
*  That's her thing and post that that sort of message and she's absolutely right and it's it is a [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=417.14s)]
*  Evil shame that so many people like her or Greta Thunberg or these people that are have these sort of public-facing [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=422.53999999999996s)]
*  Roles are made to I mean even Hassan at that point like the amount of hate the amount of smears that come from [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=428.66s)]
*  Zionists we need to just say shut up. No, yeah [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=436.14s)]
*  And link our arms around her [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=441.98s)]
*  it's a good way for us to transition to this story we had meant to play this yesterday, but [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=445.14s)]
*  Mohsen Madhavi spoke to CBS News and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=451.34000000000003s)]
*  This was on Sunday recorded on Sunday the day before [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=455.62s)]
*  He was taken by immigration officials cops [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=460.82000000000005s)]
*  The day before he was detained he was Russ the guy that showed up to his hearing right? So [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=467.18s)]
*  He was we don't know if this was a sham immigration hearing honestly because they're trying to meet their quotas [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=475.1s)]
*  But he was doing everything what right Mohsen Madhavi [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=480.3s)]
*  He's Palestinian [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=483.94s)]
*  He's spoken out against the slaughter [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=486.02000000000004s)]
*  But he is explicitly a peace activist and he went to go to his immigration hearing and was scooped up and disappeared by ICE officials [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=488.66s)]
*  And you mentioned the hearing thing is so important because JD Vance and a lot of these guys and well [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=496.54s)]
*  We've actually been so overwhelmed that we can't do the courts are overwhelmed. They're literally [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=500.82000000000005s)]
*  intervening in court dates that have already been [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=507.1s)]
*  Scheduled to snatch people up the idea that they respect or care that this is all motivated by course being overwhelmed is just a lie [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=509.86s)]
*  it's a lie and they're also using some of the systems that they put in place to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=516.74s)]
*  Formalize [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=522.94s)]
*  Like the files or keep track of people who are here in this country without documentation or who may be applying for asylum [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=524.54s)]
*  They are using those tools to now target those folks including the social security number program that Trump set up in his first term [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=532.4200000000001s)]
*  which allowed [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=539.5799999999999s)]
*  People who are here without documentation to apply for non voting social security cards [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=542.02s)]
*  So they could use that maybe as a piece of evidence [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=546.78s)]
*  Like I'm a good person [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=550.3s)]
*  I want to be a citizen one day or maybe if they need a driver's license or some other kind of government documentation [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=551.5s)]
*  right now Trump 2.0 is using that program to [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=557.9s)]
*  Zero in on these people and target them like they're criminals when they were all trying to do the right thing [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=561.74s)]
*  but it's important to play this because [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=567.3s)]
*  They're claiming this guy's a terrorist and it seems like they probably [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=569.54s)]
*  Saw this footage or knew this was happening or knew he was speaking out. I'm not sure about the timeline [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=573.54s)]
*  60 minutes interview [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=579.4599999999999s)]
*  Previous to this which is I think what he according to him is what put him on [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=581.5s)]
*  Like the lists of all those hardcore Zionist organizations saying and this is a separate CBS interview. Yes [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=586.38s)]
*  This was a previous interview. It was like a few weeks prior [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=592.06s)]
*  To when to when this interview was recorded so here he is explaining in his own words what his activism means [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=596.02s)]
*  Chrissy or much more time [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=603.6199999999999s)]
*  The American people are realizing now that there is strong correlation between the injustice [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=606.78s)]
*  That's happening in Palestine and the injustice that's happening here and the attack on free speech [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=614.06s)]
*  There's an appointment that you're showing up to [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=622.5799999999999s)]
*  Correct [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=625.0999999999999s)]
*  What is this appointment for and when did it come in? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=626.26s)]
*  Disappointment is for my citizenship application then for hundred [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=630.78s)]
*  Application, which is a naturalization process. It was scheduled on March. I believe [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=637.02s)]
*  27 [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=643.78s)]
*  After your name has been out there. Yes [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=645.78s)]
*  I'm doing and during my time [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=648.42s)]
*  Sheltering in place is this an appointment you've been waiting for for years. I've been waiting for this appointment since [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=651.46s)]
*  February of 2024 [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=660.22s)]
*  It was expected to be the window for it between [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=663.2600000000001s)]
*  November and January when you got the appointment [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=668.34s)]
*  What were your thoughts? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=672.5400000000001s)]
*  My mind went I mean [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=675.5400000000001s)]
*  Mixed feelings [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=678.18s)]
*  Right. It's first feeling of like I've been waiting for this for more than a year [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=681.02s)]
*  And the other feeling is like wait a minute. Is this a honey trap? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=687.38s)]
*  You mean you came there you think they could be calling you in to detain you [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=694.98s)]
*  If that's the case, why was it important for you to speak with us before showing up there [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=702.8199999999999s)]
*  because [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=708.46s)]
*  I believe that this story is very important for the American people and [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=709.66s)]
*  Because I believe that if I get detained [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=716.18s)]
*  tomorrow [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=719.5799999999999s)]
*  Monday [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=721.02s)]
*  This detention would be unjust and unfair and in violation of the principles of this country [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=722.6999999999999s)]
*  when you think about [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=731.62s)]
*  perhaps the Khalil case where he was taken at night and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=733.46s)]
*  We were not able to hear from him after [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=737.6999999999999s)]
*  What do you want people to hear from you in the case that you are detained? I? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=740.9399999999999s)]
*  want people to know that [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=746.4599999999999s)]
*  The work and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=751.4599999999999s)]
*  The activism that we have done was centered in the energy of love [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=754.3s)]
*  We did it because of our love for humanity our love [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=761.74s)]
*  justice our love for human rights [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=767.18s)]
*  And I want people to know [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=770.8199999999999s)]
*  that my compassion [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=773.74s)]
*  Extended beyond the Palestinian people [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=776.38s)]
*  my compassion is [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=781.34s)]
*  also for the Jewish people and [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=783.8199999999999s)]
*  For the Israelis as well [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=786.9399999999999s)]
*  So people need to actually look at both sides and figure out what is the truth because [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=789.06s)]
*  the accusation that the Palestinian cause and [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=796.5s)]
*  The pro-palestine movement at Colombia was anti-semitic is a false accusation [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=801.86s)]
*  And it is unjust accusation [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=808.66s)]
*  You've had time to think about what's happening to you and others. What do you think is the ultimate goal? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=811.3s)]
*  The ultimate goal as I see it is censoring people [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=817.74s)]
*  Preventing them from sharing their truth and controlling them by fear you say you're not hiding your sheltering in place [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=823.46s)]
*  But people don't know where you are. Why is that? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=830.5799999999999s)]
*  because basically [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=835.02s)]
*  there is [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=837.74s)]
*  I'm in Jeopardy I [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=839.74s)]
*  Mean my freedom is in Jeopardy [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=841.74s)]
*  The courts have not ruled yet on this situation clearly I believe that [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=844.46s)]
*  The track will be corrected [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=851.0200000000001s)]
*  But now it's a matter of time. It's a storm [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=854.62s)]
*  The way how I see it. This is a storm when there is a strong storm [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=858.46s)]
*  We shelter when the storm is over we go by we go out again [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=863.58s)]
*  The storm is not over and you're showing up to this meeting. Why? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=868.94s)]
*  Because I believe in the cause the Palestinian cause and I believe in justice [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=872.62s)]
*  This meeting because tomorrow could be actually the day where the storm might take me away [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=877.02s)]
*  And then my voice may not be heard for a very long time [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=885.82s)]
*  So I am giving this interview [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=891.82s)]
*  Because I have faith [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=895.34s)]
*  Faith in the people who have open hearts [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=897.1s)]
*  And who don't want to shut their eyes [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=901.82s)]
*  And who don't want to shut their eyes who want to see the truth for what it is [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=904.46s)]
*  My people are dying [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=910.9399999999999s)]
*  My family has suffered [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=913.98s)]
*  My cousins [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=917.34s)]
*  Six cousins have been killed [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=919.18s)]
*  My uncle [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=922.06s)]
*  I saw him killed in front of my eyes as a child [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=923.9s)]
*  My best friend [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=928.14s)]
*  Was shot in front of my eyes [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=930.22s)]
*  I was shot in my leg [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=933.1800000000001s)]
*  And all of these efforts [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=936.14s)]
*  Are there to silence me to say nothing about these stories that deserve to be heard [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=940.5400000000001s)]
*  What a brave incredible person um [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=948.78s)]
*  All these I keep saying i'm kids but like, you know, I just because i'm like I he's in his 30s [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=952.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. I mean I just this Mahmoud Khalil also. Um [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=958.22s)]
*  A letter from Mahmoud Khalil in the ice detention center in louisiana. I just want to read a little bit of this [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=962.0600000000001s)]
*  the incarceration of [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=968.14s)]
*  70,000 japanese american citizens as a reminder that rhetoric of justice and freedom obscures the reality that all too often america has been a democracy of [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=969.5600000000001s)]
*  Convenience rights are granted for those who align with power for the poor the people of color for those who resist injustice rights are [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=976.46s)]
*  But words written on water the right to free speech when it comes to palestine has always been exceptionally weak [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=982.7800000000001s)]
*  Even so the crackdown on universities and students reveals just how afraid the white house is of the idea of palestine's freedom entering the mainstream [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=988.3s)]
*  Why else would trump officials not only attempt to deport me [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=994.6999999999999s)]
*  But also intentionally mislead the public about who I am and what I stand for same thing with the with mosem and dawi here [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=998.2199999999999s)]

*  I hope it will inspire your outrage at the most basic human instinct [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1013.66s)]
*  To protest shameless massacre is being repressed by obscure laws racist propaganda and a state terrified of an awakened public [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1017.34s)]
*  I hope this writing will startle you into understanding that a democracy for some a democracy of convenience is no democracy at all [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1024.8600000000001s)]

*  What he was facing but as he says towards the end [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1045.26s)]
*  He's faced he's faced worse. He's been shot. He's seen his family killed in front of him [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1050.22s)]
*  His best friend killed in front of him [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1055.74s)]

*  Madhavi has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states for 10 years [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1064.62s)]
*  He went in for that naturalization interview in vermont [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1070.06s)]
*  Where his permanent residence is? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1073.66s)]
*  he is explicitly a peace activist who has been working with jewish students on [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1076.3s)]
*  Columbia's campus madhavi 34 who was active in buddhist affairs on campus worked to form a broad-based coalition of advocates for peace [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1083.5s)]
*  In both israel and gaza even as other pro-palestinian student protesters grew more radical according to his classmates and associates [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1090.94s)]
*  Madhavi condemned anti-semitism during public protests and deliberately sought to include jewish and israeli students in discussions [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1097.82s)]
*  Last fall madhavi began weekly meetings with israeli students to discuss their upbringing and beliefs about the long simmering israeli-palestinian [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1104.78s)]
*  Conflict the associate said he's being more generous than frankly I would be [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1111.98s)]
*  About like I don't necessarily want to hear from israeli students about their experience frankly because it's like [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1116.9399999999998s)]
*  I don't want to hear about the aggressor's [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1123.9s)]
*  Feelings if they're not standing with the people who are being oppressed. I would be very impatient with that [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1126.92s)]
*  I'm not as good of a person as mosem madhavi who is now [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1132.78s)]
*  Rotting in ice detention it appears and you know p as a peace activist like that's the problem actually [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1136.06s)]
*  Because zionists don't want peace [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1142.7s)]
*  That's why there can't be a ceasefire or a permanent ceasefire that any ceasefire that israel proposes is a temporary one [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1144.22s)]
*  Which allows them to reload and allows idf to go to some raves and rest for a little bit before they start massacring people again [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1150.38s)]
*  The truth is that zionism is about [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1157.26s)]
*  Conquest of an area and removing the people from that area [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1160.1200000000001s)]
*  So anybody that says actually we can all coexist in this area is a threat to them [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1163.66s)]
*  And that and you know, this is all stuff that we've theoretically said the entire time i've been doing this sort of [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1168.6200000000001s)]
*  Work and talking about bds laws [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1175.42s)]
*  It's here now and there's no like next step they're just going to keep [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1177.66s)]
*  I mean, what are they accusing madhavi of doing being a terrorist? Yeah, I think insane insane [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1182.46s)]
*  And that's the thing is like we we want we we can all recognize when bukele calls a bergo garcia [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1189.02s)]
*  Terrorist that this is a ridiculous use of the term we need to now [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1195.02s)]
*  Use that same pattern recognition and apply it to when zionists claim that they're fighting terrorism because they are not fighting terrorism [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1199.8200000000002s)]
*  They are provoking terrorism by fighting a demographic of people whose land they are stealing with war crimes [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1206.54s)]
*  Yep, and I also want to be clear. Um [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1212.22s)]
*  About the accusations about the trump administration basically i'm not sure if they're actually explicitly calling him a terrorist [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1215.8999999999999s)]
*  Um the department of homeland aligned with terrorism. I think it's anti-semitism. Yeah [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1223.74s)]
*  I mean we the the most updated article we have this is all shrouded in incredible secrecy is from gothamist [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1228.1399999999999s)]
*  The department of homeland security has now responded to a request for comment about madhavi's arrest and i-spokes [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1233.3400000000001s)]
*  Spokesperson referred questions to the office of senate secretary of state marco rubio [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1238.76s)]
*  Whose spokespeople have not responded but a memo from rubio states that the trump administration is seeking to deport madhavi [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1243.3400000000001s)]
*  Because his activities could be could potentially undermine the middle east peace process [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1249.1000000000001s)]
*  peace ridiculous [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1254.0600000000002s)]
*  He's literally a peace activist the conquest process is what rubio means in the orwellian turn of phrase [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1256.3s)]
*  Con um kudos. Sorry kudos to uh, congressman cassara [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1262.5400000000002s)]
*  He was one of the democrats who voted against the ihra definition of anti-semitism [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1265.98s)]
*  But that seems to be also emma your point when you're asking him, you know [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1271.18s)]
*  Like is the conversation changing internally in the democratic caucus at some point there has to be a conversation about you know [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1275.74s)]
*  overturning that that [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1282.52s)]
*  I'm bored. I i'm not bored. That's such a such a blase way to refer to it. I am [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1284.6200000000001s)]
*  Frustrated by even our most progressive members [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1290.52s)]
*  Like bernie is shouting down palestine protests at that rally. Yep. It's a shame [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1294.5400000000002s)]
*  I want to propagandize for that thing and they're having people taken out because they're putting palestine flags up by cops [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1299.42s)]
*  Why dude like stop? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1306.22s)]
*  I mean even the rep repetition of israel has a right to defend itself. Yep. Cut that out, too, please [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1308.8600000000001s)]
*  um and [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1314.0600000000002s)]
*  Like I think our the squad members have been better than sanders on this in terms of like [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1316.06s)]
*  Aoc and ilhan and of course rashida talib early on calling it a genocide speaking out about israel [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1320.3s)]
*  but [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1326.6200000000001s)]
*  Even our most left-wing members of congress are not meeting [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1327.74s)]
*  the reality of what the situation is which is that [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1331.5s)]
*  We need a south africa style truth and reconciliation commission [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1334.7s)]
*  after a peace process that [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1339.1s)]
*  Reintegrates the territory of israel into one that is a democratic state for palestinians and israelis [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1342.44s)]
*  to live side by side now [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1350.94s)]
*  People will say to me [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1353.74s)]
*  Well, you don't think israel has a right to exist then [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1355.5s)]
*  I mean, I don't necessarily think that's a the right construction. I think israelis that are there currently [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1358.3000000000002s)]
*  Have a right to live in peace [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1364.5400000000002s)]
*  Uh unless they're war criminals and they should be tried in court and then we determine make those determinations [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1366.54s)]
*  um [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1371.8999999999999s)]
*  But so the palestinians and the question is is with israel having taken so much territory [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1372.86s)]
*  Basically ethnically cleansing the entire gaza strip as is their goal [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1379.42s)]
*  Taking so much of the west bank and settling there [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1383.8999999999999s)]
*  They have created a one state reality where there's three million people in the occupied west bank who they have complete control over and then they've [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1387.02s)]
*  Created an open air concentration camp where they're executing a final solution against palestinians in the gaza strip to take that land to create [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1394.46s)]
*  One state there will never be two states never ever ever. I mean, I shouldn't say that I shouldn't make predictions [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1401.74s)]
*  there might be as a step to another but like in terms of of [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1408.38s)]
*  The current facts on the ground as the as the israelis would say, um, it's impossible unless israel [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1413.18s)]
*  Israel [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1419.66s)]
*  Gives up a bunch of land that it's illegally stolen and I don't see that coming [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1420.8600000000001s)]
*  So the what is the best situation is that we? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1424.3000000000002s)]
*  intervene internationally [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1427.96s)]
*  to make sure [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1429.9s)]
*  That we create a state like south africa where apartheid falls [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1431.3400000000001s)]
*  And everybody can have access to that land and there are still problems in south africa [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1435.98s)]
*  The white landowners own like 70 of the farmland for example [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1440.22s)]
*  that there hasn't been enough done but [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1444.22s)]
*  This is people will say that's impossible. No, the current situation is impossible [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1447.1s)]
*  We're paying utopia prices already for apartheid and the thing is is like [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1451.26s)]
*  Please tell me about israel's right to exist because I think it's actually something [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1456.94s)]
*  That the reason it's insisted upon is because it's actually really questionable when we define israel as a demographic majority of a certain [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1461.4199999999998s)]
*  population that wasn't there but could only be produced through conquest and war crimes, which is what israel has been [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1468.84s)]
*  Produced through doesn't have the right to exist though [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1475.5s)]
*  If we want to talk about some hypothetical israel where everyone within that region is given [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1479.18s)]
*  One vote one man one vote one person one vote [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1484.22s)]
*  I would say it's probably a compromise to even call that israel [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1487.98s)]
*  I would prefer it called palestine and then also assure the safety of jews in that region, too [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1491.02s)]
*  I think generally that shouldn't have been the place for refuge. I think maybe america should have taken more back in the day [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1495.74s)]
*  But now that this is here [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1501.74s)]
*  Yes, the two-state solution is just a fiction harbored by people that want to let bb netanyahu continue to roll over palestinian bodies [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1503.74s)]
*  Um the what it will look like the bantu stands of south africa [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1511.82s)]
*  um in any kind of uh [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1516.86s)]
*  Scenario, it's just very clear that that's what israel sees as the model [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1519.34s)]
*  That's why they supported south africa when it was an apartheid state [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1523.9s)]
*  one person one vote and the problem with that is [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1528.14s)]
*  And you see this everywhere. I remember robbie soav being like well, of course we can't have the right to return every every [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1532.6200000000001s)]
*  There's so many people in media that are just like right to return. That's obviously ridiculous [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1537.42s)]
*  Well, the un doesn't think so and i'll just say like you cannot displace people using uh, well if you do [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1541.42s)]
*  Displace people permanently and settle ground after conquest. That is a war crime [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1547.8200000000002s)]
*  So I don't think war crimes have the right to exist. I think that's what modern israel is a giant war crime [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1553.1000000000001s)]
*  Uh chris in texas israel should be considered an active invasion. Um [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1559.66s)]
*  Dsa aron in atlanta no state has the right to exist, especially in apartheid genocidal fascist state [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1564.54s)]
*  Uh randy gornberg do palestinians have a right to defend themselves [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1569.3400000000001s)]
*  Does palestine have a right to exist ask these questions every time you hear someone ask about israel's rights [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1572.54s)]
*  That's the that's the other thing is why i'm pessimistic about the idea of a two-state solution as well [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1576.54s)]
*  It's like that wouldn't necessitate palestine in the second state having a army [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1580.78s)]
*  Me [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1586.22s)]
*  You think israel's gonna agree to that agree to that you think so [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1587.74s)]
*  Good luck [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1592.3s)]
*  You know to this point of the right of return like i'm jewish. So [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1593.5s)]
*  I've never you know, i'm not from israel. No one in my immediate family is from israel [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1597.82s)]
*  My grandparents my great grandparents. None of us are from israel [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1602.06s)]
*  But I have a right to go there and become a citizen should I so choose one of my best friends growing up [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1605.1s)]
*  From the same suburb I grew up in in san diego, his name is sam shout out sam is palestinian [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1611.5s)]

*  And one more point I wanted to make uh, there was a fringe [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1627.98s)]
*  radical left-wing thinker [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1631.42s)]
*  Uh during the obama years his name was john carry who said famously [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1633.74s)]
*  Israel can either be a democracy or it can be a jewish state. It can't be both [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1639.02s)]
*  Exactly, right john carry the radical hamas supporter the antifa [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1644.3799999999999s)]
*  Secretary of state the upside down red triangle john carry [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1649.42s)]
*  I mean when I look at him, I just think militant militant wait till hamas gets a windsurfing [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsbc2Pu837E&t=1654.22s)]
