# Has The Tide Turned Against Israeli Propaganda?
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c)
*  Yesterday, Haaretz, the Israeli paper, wrote about this study that was conducted by the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=0.0s)]
*  Hebrew University of Jerusalem. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=10.72s)]
*  So this is done by the university. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  The Zionists will say, Haaretz, so liberals, right? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=18.2s)]
*  Nope, they're just reposting what the study found, reporting on it, and you can't count [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=22.04s)]
*  on other Israeli media to do that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=26.2s)]
*  So 64% of Israelis see no need for more reporting on Gaza suffering, is what the poll found. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=28.34s)]
*  Now we should say that this includes Arab Israelis in this total, so in terms of Jewish [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=35.06s)]
*  Israelis it's higher than 64%, who see no need to cover Gaza suffering anymore. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=40.5s)]
*  If we could go to the other paragraph, according to the survey conducted by Dr. Boaz Sharkey [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=48.58s)]
*  and Lee Aldar, 64% of Israelis believe that the local media's reporting on Gaza has been [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  balanced and there is no need to present a broader picture regarding the situation of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=61.32s)]
*  Gaza's civilians. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=66.52s)]
*  89% of the people that support the Netanyahu government have that view. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  But the other question is, if we could scroll down a little bit more here, this is good. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=72.64s)]
*  41% of all respondents said that the news on Israel's two mainstream commercial stations, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=79.0s)]
*  channels 12 and 13, are biased in favor of the population of Gaza. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=84.0s)]
*  So that is the plurality opinion. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=87.88s)]
*  But I scroll down even more, because that's insane, but there's even more. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=90.48s)]
*  Okay, here we go. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=95.08s)]
*  Actually no, down a little bit more. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=100.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=102.82s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=103.82s)]
*  Another question asked in the Accord poll was, to what extent respondents agreed with [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=104.82s)]
*  the statement that there are no innocent people in Gaza? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=108.12s)]
*  64% agreed with it to a large extent, describing their agreement as between 4 and 6 on a scale [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  in which 1 is total disagreement and 6 is complete agreement. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  So this is the top 50th percentile in terms of strength of response. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=121.44s)]
*  64% agree with the statement there are no innocent people in Gaza. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  And then the last piece of the poll that I think is important is on the here, this paragraph. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=131.84s)]
*  When it comes to Israelis' views of foreign media outlets, which for the purposes of the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=136.98s)]
*  polling referred to CNN and the BBC, 69% of respondents said they were biased in favor [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=142.06s)]
*  of Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=148.12s)]
*  Even when asked about Fox News, which is identified with the American right wing, half of those [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  polled and 67% of voters for coalition parties said it was biased in favor of Gazans. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  I just want people to sit with that for just a second. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=163.78s)]
*  69% of overall Israelis think CNN and BBC's coverage, and here in the United States, we're [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=167.42s)]
*  intimately aware with CNN's coverage. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=172.57999999999998s)]
*  And Dana Bash and Jake Tapper pushing the pro-Israel narrative over and over and over [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=175.38s)]
*  again. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=180.73999999999998s)]
*  69% of Israelis think they're biased in favor of Palestinians and half of Israelis think [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  Fox News is biased in favor of Palestinians. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=186.66s)]
*  What do you make of those numbers? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=191.1s)]
*  What does it say about the West and Israeli society's role in it? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=192.52s)]
*  I mean, honestly, there's something refreshing about it because there isn't this sort of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  attempt to hide behind a narrative that clearly has no connection with reality. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=210.36s)]
*  One of the ironic things about that study is that if you were to try to essentially [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=216.44s)]
*  write a new story about that and run it in most of these Western publications that are [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  considered too biased in favor of Palestinians, you either wouldn't get it on the air or you'd [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=228.83999999999997s)]
*  get fired for it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  It would be considered too inflammatory. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  And this is true of a lot of stuff that runs in Israeli media and runs plainly without [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=237.6s)]
*  any real controversy that would be considered far too controversial to run in the Western [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=241.29999999999998s)]
*  world. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=247.89999999999998s)]
*  I mean, one way to think about this is imagine living in Israeli society right now and not [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=248.89999999999998s)]
*  holding those views. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=256.34s)]
*  How incredibly frustrating an experience that must be. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=259.24s)]
*  This is essentially a viewpoint that is in line with the reality of what is happening, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=271.06s)]
*  obviously in the most overt way over the last 20 months, but also over the last 70 plus [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=275.92s)]
*  years. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=281.0s)]
*  The non-existence of the Palestinian people is central to a particular narrative of Israeli [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  life. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  And again, if that sounds controversial, fine, but it's in line with the reality of the situation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  It's an ethno-state maintained by violence and domination, and a majority of Israeli [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=298.48s)]
*  society wants the violence and domination to continue to maintain the ethnic purity [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=304.88s)]
*  of the state. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=309.98s)]
*  And I mean, look, if all this stuff makes your viewers or your listeners uncomfortable, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=310.98s)]
*  fine, ignore Israel entirely. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=315.48s)]
*  Name me one colonial outpost in history that was able to maintain its colonial narrative [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=319.24s)]
*  while simultaneously maintaining a narrative in which the indigenous population that had [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=325.88s)]
*  to be displaced or eradicated was of equal value. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=330.68s)]
*  Their lives were of equal value. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=336.32s)]
*  It certainly does not exist in the United States. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=337.32s)]
*  It only exists in hindsight. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=339.32s)]
*  It only exists one or 200 years later when the Obama administration can issue this declaration [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=341.68s)]
*  saying sorry about all the genocide. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=348.24s)]
*  And my book is titled what is titled for a reason, right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=351.4s)]
*  Because we're going to get around to that place. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=355.22s)]
*  We're not there yet. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=357.42s)]
*  And so to me, first of all, this isn't the first poll of its kind. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=358.8s)]
*  This is obviously incredibly heightened because of the moment we're in. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  But there's a very long history of these kinds of opinions being in place. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=369.22s)]
*  And they sort of have to be, right? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=374.18s)]
*  There's no way somebody can imply that a situation in which quite literally millions of Palestinians [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=377.42s)]
*  live in open air prisons, where every movement is subjected to control by the Israeli military, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=384.82s)]
*  where they have to carry different ID cards and travel down different roads and take different [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=390.82s)]
*  buses. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=394.78s)]
*  There's no way somebody can imply that that is an equal landscape from which to build [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=396.14s)]
*  peace. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=401.94s)]
*  That just doesn't exist. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=403.14s)]
*  And I think honestly, it's sort of refreshing to just see that statement outright. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=404.14s)]
*  Instead of hearing some State Department spokesperson talk to me about the desire for equal peace [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=409.2s)]
*  and equal justice, as all the while my tax money is funding this incredible glaring asymmetry. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=413.84s)]
*  And this is why it has to come from the outside, like it had to do in South Africa and in Rhodesia. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=422.84s)]
*  And the differences, I think, in those instances are, one, the level of militarization and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=430.44s)]
*  bombing is not anywhere close. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=437.71999999999997s)]
*  But two, white people were definitely demographic minorities. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=440.4s)]
*  The anxiety too within Israel is the idea that it's more like 50-50 if you were to incorporate [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=446.96s)]
*  Palestinians into official statehood, not just under occupation and control and as third [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=458.0s)]
*  class citizens that they're now slaughtering. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=463.88s)]
*  So I guess that's a good way, I think, for us to wrap here. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=467.52s)]
*  In this place right now, the Mamdani campaign in here in New York is very exciting. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  And he went on TV and he talked about, when being asked about his views about Israel, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=484.32s)]
*  they said, do you believe as a Jewish state that you support it? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=490.28s)]
*  He said he supports it as a state of equal rights. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=495.0s)]
*  And this is, I think, a really important divergence from liberalism, which has been maintaining [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=498.28s)]
*  this two-state solution myth for longer than my lifetime. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=504.8s)]
*  And it's so untenable at this point, but our politicians on the national level have completely [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=511.8s)]
*  not caught up to it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=516.68s)]
*  Can you speak about the contradiction of liberalism's support for Israel as an ethnostate, especially [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=518.46s)]
*  when you compare it to the multicultural values these same people espouse domestically? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=525.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's something patently exhausting about trying to maintain a sort of [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=534.9599999999999s)]
*  liberal approach to this, because you essentially have to take every other value that you claim [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=542.92s)]
*  to espouse in every other case and carve out a little exception for it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=549.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, segregation is wrong, except in this case where it's good and necessary. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=554.4399999999999s)]
*  Apartheid is wrong, except in this case where it's good and necessary. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=559.08s)]
*  The sort of visceral emotional and psychological reaction you feel when you hear about people [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=563.64s)]
*  being forced to take only certain roads, for example, has to be set aside. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=572.76s)]
*  And over time, that is damaging, right? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=579.84s)]
*  And I think what you're seeing right now is, at least for the first time in my lifetime, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=585.12s)]
*  an actual political consequence to this kind of incredibly disjointed mode of liberalism, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=592.76s)]
*  in which you hold on very vocally to a certain set of views and principles, except in one case. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=600.32s)]
*  If you had told me two years ago that the suffering of the Palestinian people would [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=608.28s)]
*  factor in any way in the results of a US presidential election, I would have thought you were out [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=613.3199999999999s)]
*  of your mind. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  And now it can be argued that at least to a certain extent, this factored in the last [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=621.16s)]
*  presidential election. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=627.12s)]
*  That means something. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=629.3199999999999s)]
*  There is someone who, you know, maybe he doesn't win, but has a serious shot at becoming mayor [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  of maybe the most important city in the country, who is finally calling out this glaring hypocrisy. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=636.44s)]
*  Again, if you told me that two years ago, I would have thought you're out of your mind. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=643.0s)]
*  And so what you're watching, I think, is a level of change. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=647.2s)]
*  But politics, particularly sort of federal politics in this country, is a trailing metric. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=650.5200000000001s)]
*  It takes a very long time to catch up with what the population is thinking, what people [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=656.36s)]
*  are demanding. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=662.96s)]
*  And so as sort of heartened as I am by just seeing the most basic acknowledgement and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=664.32s)]
*  the most rudimentary changes, it is depressing in the sense that I think of, you know, how [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=671.5200000000001s)]
*  many bodies between this moment and when we reach political calculus that acknowledges [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=677.96s)]
*  it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=682.9200000000001s)]
*  Something is changing. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=684.44s)]
*  It's just changing very, very slowly. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=685.44s)]
*  And the Israelis are counting on that. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=688.2s)]
*  It's why they're killing every journalist that they can find. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=689.9200000000001s)]
*  It's the deadliest conflict. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=692.84s)]
*  I hate calling it that, but that's the metrics used for journalists in history. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=694.88s)]
*  And they've killed all the record keepers. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=700.88s)]
*  They've killed them. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=703.52s)]
*  And so they want to use this period of darkness, both journalistically and in terms of Gaza's [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=704.52s)]
*  capacity to count the dead and their hospital capacity to kill as many as they can in this [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=712.52s)]
*  period of time where they're doing it in somewhat secret. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=718.76s)]
*  I mean, look, the moment a U.S. presidential administration makes the phone call and lets [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=724.4s)]
*  it be known that there's actual consequences to any of this and that it needs to stop, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=729.9s)]
*  it will stop. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=736.04s)]
*  I mean, fundamentally, this has happened in the past. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=737.04s)]
*  This happened under Reagan very famously. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=741.14s)]
*  None of this happens without my tax money. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=746.08s)]
*  None of it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=748.72s)]
*  And the second a solution is imposed by the United States, and I use the word imposed [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=750.12s)]
*  very deliberately here, it will come to fruition. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=755.0s)]
*  But we have had administration after administration, year after year, decade after decade of some [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  White House or State Department spokesperson coming up to the podium and saying, we're [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=766.6800000000001s)]
*  so flustered and frustrated. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=771.7s)]
*  We don't know what to do. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=773.9000000000001s)]
*  They won't listen to us. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=775.02s)]
*  And it's patently nonsense. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=776.26s)]
*  And everybody knows it's nonsense. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=779.02s)]
*  Everybody knows that the second that there are actual consequences and there's actual [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=781.5s)]
*  pressure to not engage in what is effectively wholesale slaughter, that will all come to [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=786.02s)]
*  an end. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=791.8199999999999s)]
*  It's just a matter of waiting on whether there's enough domestic political pressure such that [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=792.9s)]
*  enough politicians make the calculation that it is in their favor or in their personal [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=798.5799999999999s)]
*  interest to consider Palestinians human. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=804.46s)]
*  We're effectively waiting on that date. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=807.22s)]
*  Every other argument is an attempt to employ a level of pragmatism and political calculus [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=809.3000000000001s)]
*  onto something that, at least to my mind, is as clear a moral issue as has existed in [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=818.84s)]
*  my lifetime. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=824.5400000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=825.5400000000001s)]
*  Well, everybody should read. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=826.5400000000001s)]
*  One day everyone will have always been against this. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=829.62s)]
*  It's a beautiful book. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=832.64s)]
*  Omar, thanks so much for your time today. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AActXgEIe5c&t=833.84s)]
