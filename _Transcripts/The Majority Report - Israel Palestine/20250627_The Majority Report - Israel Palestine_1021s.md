# Zohran's Win Exposes Dem Party's UGLY Islamophobia Problem
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI)
*  We have seen a wide array of responses to Zoran Mamdani really spanking Andrew Cuomo [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Democratic primary for mayor. Now, just an update. Cuomo has decided that there is not [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=11.44s)]
*  going to be, he is not going to give up his ballot access. The deadline passed, I think, yesterday. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=20.16s)]
*  That does not mean that he's going to run, but it does sound like he's going to see how much money [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=31.28s)]
*  he can get to run. They are scrambling big time. I'm sure you guys yesterday spoke about the Bill [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  Ackerman, insane rant on, I've been getting up in the middle of the night, like at three, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=44.88s)]
*  and I know I shouldn't go on Twitter, but I still, because of the whole Zoran thing, like I do, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=54.88s)]
*  and I saw him, he had tweeted at one in the morning. It was literally something that he must [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=59.52s)]
*  have been writing all day. It ended with, we're going to do a writing candidate. I will tell you, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=65.28s)]
*  the level of insanity associated with something like that is enormous. And just on top of the fact [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=71.2s)]
*  that like, dude, you're literally saying that you're going to try and buy this election. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=78.88000000000001s)]
*  This is all stuff that you should never have written down for publishing. I mean, you should [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=87.36s)]
*  never do any of what you're talking about, and you shouldn't be you, but I understand that you are. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=94.48s)]
*  But you should not be tweeting that out like that. It is in the, your absolute worst interest, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  which allows me to believe that honestly, he's just, he's just crazy. We, I know you've gone [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  over yesterday, a wide array of the right wing bigotry that was unleashed, and it's almost as if [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=113.76s)]
*  they, it is what I call everything bagel bigotry. And they don't know which, which element of the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=120.8s)]
*  bagel of the everything on the bagel that they want to focus in on. And I understand [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=135.84s)]
*  folks like Hakeem Jeffries and, and Chuck Schumer, you know, giving sort of half hearted, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=143.68s)]
*  not so congratulations or, you know, recognition, because, of course, their donors are, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=154.24s)]
*  are very concerned about Mamdani, probably more from a taxation standpoint, and also broads [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=165.44s)]
*  broadly speaking, they all know that things like this create broader implications in our body [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=172.08s)]
*  politic. It's not just New York City they're worried about. It's not just the added 2% if I [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  make over a million dollars, you know, the $20,000 for a millionaire is just, you know, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=186.0s)]
*  people like $20,000 if you have a million dollars, but it's not, it's not that big of a deal. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=193.68s)]
*  It's not that big of a deal. They, they are concerned about it spreading, and giving people [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=199.44s)]
*  hope. And they are they it's the precedent they're concerned about. But I have to say [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=211.28s)]
*  that with all of that, as jaded as I am, I was shocked to hear the audio of Christian Gillibrand [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=222.24s)]
*  on WNYC. And I'll tell you something like I heard about this seconds after it was on air [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=231.28s)]
*  from total normies who texted me and were like, you cannot believe all Jews, incidentally, too. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=241.04s)]
*  I mean, yeah, actually, I heard it from three people within like 10 minutes, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=250.96s)]
*  who listened to Brian Lear, which I now okay, back in the day at Air America, at one point, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=259.68s)]
*  I was on against him, which case it was not appropriate to listen. But they all texted me [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=265.92s)]
*  some variation of you cannot believe what Christian Gillibrand just did on Brian Lear show. It was [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=272.8s)]
*  bizarre, insane, bigoted, nuts, I think were the some variation of those. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=279.44s)]
*  Here is now understand Brian Lear show, it's a local show, but it's New York City. So it's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=288.88s)]
*  quite large, bigger than most probably national shows, even maybe for some. He takes phone calls, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=294.56s)]
*  when he has guests on, he takes phone calls, and they ask the guest question. And you will always [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=302.48s)]
*  get a wider rate of guests. So the issue here is not so much I'm not so surprised about the caller. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=308.4s)]
*  And I'm not so surprised about the caller, you know, sort of like presenting a series of lies [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=314.08s)]
*  or exaggerations or manipulations that Lear can't address. And to be clear, Lear was not [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=319.84s)]
*  a Mamdani guy in the run up to the election. But I don't know, I think he was almost worried [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=328.4s)]
*  about getting sued at this point. But listen to not just the caller, that's almost less relevant, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=335.28s)]
*  it is less relevant. Listen to Christian Gillibrand. This is her speaking incidentally, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=343.52s)]
*  hot off the heels of her midwifing, the Genius Act. I mean, she was, I don't know if she was [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  author, but she was certainly one of the co sponsors. The Genius Act is a crypto bill [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  that is going to be I guarantee you, I don't know that I'll still be around. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=366.56s)]
*  Maybe I'll be down to one a week at that point. But in 510 15 years, we're going to have a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=373.2s)]
*  financial meltdown. And it's going to be because of this. Among other things, probably, but that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  Genius bill. But this is just completely insane. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my call [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=386.88s)]
*  and question. I want to ask two very pertinent questions about the threat facing the Jewish [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=395.76s)]
*  community, unfortunately, from the Ramon Donnie. There was a bill that I was reading about that, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=399.44s)]
*  unfortunately, he wants to target synagogue and Jewish institutions which donate to non-profits, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=403.12s)]
*  which are medical institutions like United Hattala and Magan Devod, David Adam, which is like the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=408.24s)]
*  Jewish Red Cross. So how do we make sure that Jewish institutions are protected from his plans [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=412.0s)]
*  to punish and find our institutions which fundraise the medical nonprofits, which do work [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=416.24s)]
*  both here in the United States and in Israel and other countries in the world? And also, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=421.04s)]
*  how can we hold Mr. Mondani accountable for his glorifying association of Hamas and other terror [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=424.16s)]
*  bombings of the intifada in 1990s, where over 1000 Jewish Israelis were killed to his revisionist [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=427.92s)]
*  Holocaust knowledge to the Warsaw ghetto uprising, where Jews were mass exterminated and face threats [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=432.0s)]
*  he compared when Jews were killed to when Jews fought back against Nazis. It's quite despicable. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=436.8s)]
*  I'm sorry. Okay, thank you for your call. There's a lot in there, Senator, some of which may be [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=440.8s)]
*  inaccurate. So I don't know, I can't fact check everything in real time, but do you know any of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=444.16s)]
*  that to be inaccurate or accurate, including the original premise that he would somehow target [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  synagogues if they were contributing to groups like Hattala Ambulance Services in a way that he [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=456.24s)]
*  could hurt the synagogues? I just don't want to give out information that's false, but I also [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  don't want to shrink from information that's true. Well, the caller is exactly the New York [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=466.8s)]
*  constituents that I've spoken to that are alarmed. They are alarmed by past public statements. They [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=472.24s)]
*  are alarmed by past positions, particularly references to global jihad. This is a very [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=476.48s)]
*  serious issue because people that glorify the slaughter of Jews create fear in our- [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=481.04s)]
*  That's her first lie. He didn't say we should engage in global jihad. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=485.6s)]
*  What? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=493.04s)]
*  You're a US Senator. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=498.64000000000004s)]
*  And incidentally, this is obviously sped up a little bit. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=503.20000000000005s)]
*  So like this wasn't, you know, she misspoke, I guess. She being very fast and loose. Global jihad. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=508.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  Past positions, particularly references to global jihad. This is a very serious issue because people [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=521.68s)]
*  that glorify the slaughter of Jews create fear in our communities. The global- [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=526.9599999999999s)]
*  Pause it for a second. People that glorify the slaughter of Jews create fear in our communities. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=531.28s)]
*  Who is glorifying the slaughter of Jews? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=538.88s)]
*  Who is glorifying the slaughter of Jews? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=541.28s)]
*  Well, who is that she's talking about? She's talking about Zoran Mamdani. Is she claiming [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=545.36s)]
*  he's glorifying the slaughter of Jews? Maybe Christian Gillibrand should call Brad Lander. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=552.0s)]
*  Maybe Christian- Is her name Christian Gillibrand or is it Christian? I think it's Christian. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=563.76s)]
*  Maybe she should check in with a Jew before she starts claiming that Mamdani is glorifying the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=569.6s)]
*  slaughter of Jews. Unbelievable. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  This is a very serious issue because people that glorify the slaughter of Jews create fear [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=580.4000000000001s)]
*  in our communities. The global intifada is a statement that means destroy Israel and kill all [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=584.96s)]
*  the Jews. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=591.12s)]
*  Pause it for a second. That is also a lie. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=591.6s)]
*  That is also a lie. It doesn't mean either one of those things. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=594.88s)]
*  In no possible way does it mean kill all the Jews. It doesn't really mean destroy Israel either, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=605.12s)]
*  but that's like three steps away. If you wanted to really fudge it a little bit, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=614.24s)]
*  you could get to destroy Israel or destroy the ethno state as opposed to a political revolution. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=622.88s)]
*  No one's even fever dreams. Does it mean kill all the Jews or any Jews? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=637.68s)]
*  These are the kind of things that if Mr. Mamdani is elected our mayor, we'll need to assure all [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=645.12s)]
*  new workers that he will protect all Jews and protect houses of worship and protect funding for [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=650.96s)]
*  not-for-profits that meet the needs of these communities. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=655.6s)]
*  Pause it. Maybe she doesn't get over the air television and maybe she hasn't heard of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=657.36s)]
*  Colbert, but in addition to him doing this on the campaign over and over again, he was on [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  with Brad Lander being extremely explicit about this. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  Brad Lander saying, in fact, not only we're going to have a Jew and a Muslim going around [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=675.6s)]
*  campaigning together, it's as New York as it gets. Incidentally, those not-for-profits that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=684.4s)]
*  meet the needs of these communities, the needs of the community that she's referring to, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=694.08s)]
*  maybe she doesn't know, are illegal settlements in the West Bank that were illegal under Joe Biden. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=700.88s)]
*  Now, Israel has said that they're legal. Now, they're still illegal under what has been [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=712.4s)]
*  everybody's past policy, including Biden's, maybe short of Donald Trump's and certainly [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=718.64s)]
*  international law. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=725.8399999999999s)]
*  You still have to do as our mayor. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=726.9599999999999s)]
*  He would certainly say that he has committed to protecting all Jews in New York as [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=728.7199999999999s)]
*  mayor of New York. Do you dispute? Do you? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  Pause it for a second. Now, Lear says this in a sideways way. He should have probably, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=735.3599999999999s)]
*  he said, well, he has committed. It's not that he would say that he has committed. Now, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=741.5999999999999s)]
*  you may not believe him. He could be a secret sleeper cell. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=747.4399999999999s)]
*  But he not only would say that he said that he has said that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=751.12s)]
*  Good. Do you doubt that? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=757.28s)]
*  Well, one of the issues I did talk to him yesterday was exactly this issue, and he has [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=760.0s)]
*  agreed to work with me on this and to protect all residents. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=763.2s)]
*  Okay, pause it. This is where Christian Gillibrand seems to have a repeat offender, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=766.4s)]
*  despicable person, who is a suspect. He's a suspect. He's a suspect. He's a suspect. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=773.6s)]
*  Repeat offender, despicable problem. If you read the Jane Mayer story about Al Franken, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=778.88s)]
*  she came out and called for his resignation when it was already clear that he was going to do that. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=786.96s)]
*  And her coming out and saying like she's going to take credit for him to protect all. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=795.84s)]
*  No, he's been saying from day one. Go ahead. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=801.28s)]
*  This is something I care deeply about, and so I will be an advocate on these things [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=805.28s)]
*  I think are important to New Yorkers. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=809.52s)]
*  You know what else she was an advocate on? It seems to me sexual harassment [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=810.88s)]
*  in the military. And I'm trying to think who it was that Zoran Mondani was running against. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=816.4s)]
*  Oh, yes, a serial sexual harasser. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=827.8399999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  I get on these issues. These are things that I think are important to New Yorkers. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=830.8s)]
*  And I will work with him when he gets elected, if he gets elected, to [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=834.8s)]
*  make sure everyone is protected. I also on a federal level work to get resources for [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=838.0s)]
*  all our religious sites in the state and in the city. I lead the letter for funding for [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=842.64s)]
*  for the funding to protect synagogues and churches and temples [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=850.24s)]
*  and places of worship across our city. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=853.84s)]
*  Oh, wait a second. I'm trying to think of the three big religions in the state. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=855.44s)]
*  Uh, Christianity, they go to churches and Jews go to temples, although sometimes you call it [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=860.88s)]
*  synagogues. Hindus go to temple. That about covers it. I feel like. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=869.0400000000001s)]
*  Oh, mosques. I have to look at that up in the dictionary. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=879.6800000000001s)]
*  Funny, it's funny how global jihad comes right to mind. But mosque, I forgot the name of it. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=883.12s)]
*  Or the funding to protect synagogues and churches and temples and places of worship [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=891.44s)]
*  across our city and state. And these are things that he has assured me in [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=895.92s)]
*  my one conversation that he will protect everyone. But I understand why people are [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=900.16s)]
*  concerned because of past statements. And so this is just an issue that I will work with him on for [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=903.04s)]
*  sure. I just feel compelled to say we can find no evidence that he has supported Hamas or has [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=906.64s)]
*  supported violent jihad as that caller was asserting. Can you? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=912.24s)]
*  Um, again, Brian, I don't have all the data and information and I've never sat down with Mr. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=920.72s)]
*  Mamdani. So I've asked to have that meeting. I'm going to have that meeting. We will talk through [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=924.64s)]
*  all these things. He can tell me his views of the world. Oh, I hope we get a live stream of you [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=928.24s)]
*  asking him if he's in favor of Hamas and violent jihad. This is just unbelievable. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=933.36s)]
*  I, I. If she doesn't get primaried, I will be shocked if she doesn't get primaried. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=940.0s)]
*  I may just despair my run against Schumer and run against her. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=948.16s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, did I say that? Get the Kirsten out. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=955.2s)]
*  Someone's going to get a read Gillibrand did. I don't know. We got to get a good one. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=963.84s)]
*  Work on the work on the on the slogan. We will win. We will win. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=970.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable that it's unbelievable. She needs to issue an apology, multiple apologies. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=979.52s)]
*  Well, her comes person said she misspoke, so not enough to apologize for it, but she misspoke. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=985.52s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. Was this she misspoke? Was this was this was this a special episode of the Brian [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcvK6qN4_qI&t=990.0s)]
