# US Senator Visits Detained Palestinian Activist Mohsen Mahdawi
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo)
*  Really encouraged to see this, Senator Peter Welsh of Vermont, the junior senator of Vermont, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=0.0s)]
*  after Bernie Sanders, went to visit Mohsen Madawi inside of immigration detention. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=6.48s)]
*  He was taken when he showed up to his immigration hearing in court. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=12.0s)]
*  He had known that it was likely that he would be detained because of his pacifist speech [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=16.84s)]
*  speaking out against Israel's slaughter in Gaza. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=23.4s)]
*  Even as he wrote publicly about the scourge of anti-Semitism, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=26.88s)]
*  even as he engaged with Jewish and Israeli students on campus at Columbia, it didn't matter. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=31.4s)]
*  He's now being locked up for his speech. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=37.76s)]
*  And we unfortunately haven't seen enough of this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=40.04s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen started to kick this off by doing a really good thing, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  going down to El Salvador to try to see if he could meet face to face with Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=49.88s)]
*  confirm that he was still alive. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  And now you have members of Congress going down to El Salvador, drawing attention to that case, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=56.84s)]
*  but other cases as well, including the hairdresser who is still locked up in this torture chamber [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=61.080000000000005s)]
*  who was picked up, presumably, in California. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=69.36s)]
*  But there's also, of course, the student activists who are being targeted and just academics [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=71.56s)]
*  for daring to speak out against the genocide. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=76.72s)]
*  Right. And so I want to see I want to see all of this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=81.2s)]
*  Like, we need to be seeing way more of this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=86.28s)]
*  I expect extremely little of the of the Democrats who represent New York state in the Senate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=88.84s)]
*  But it still is just incredible to me that neither Chuck Schumer nor Gillibrand are are. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=96.16s)]
*  I will be shocked. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=102.2s)]
*  I will be shocked if they they visit Khalil in prison. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  No, they won't. Van Hollen has already gotten attack ads from APAC. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=109.8s)]
*  Any member of Congress in the Senate that takes Israel money will not be. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=113.44s)]
*  Here's a prediction. They will not be courageous or righteous on this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=119.72s)]
*  They will be cravenly and say, why are we focusing so much on this? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=125.28s)]
*  Look at the markets. We should be focusing on how much the Dow Jones is dropping. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=128.0s)]
*  This it's really important that we see more of this stuff. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=132.6s)]
*  So I wanted to make sure we played a little bit of what of Peter Walsh's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  conversation with his constituent from ICE detention. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm here with her friend from the upper value. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=144.76s)]
*  Most of we've been having a nice talk, but I want to have a chance to explain to people [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=147.44s)]
*  how you're doing and what you hope to accomplish and how is it you're saying so positive despite your circumstances? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=153.16s)]
*  Thank you for the visit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=161.52s)]
*  It really means a lot and it reassures me of the support that I have from you [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=164.32s)]
*  and from the Vermonters as well. My people, the people of Vermont. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=170.32s)]
*  I'm staying positive by reassuring myself and the inevitability of justice [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=175.76s)]
*  and the deep belief of democracy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=182.44s)]
*  This is the reason I wanted to become a citizen of this country, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=185.36s)]
*  because I believe in the principles of this country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=188.56s)]
*  You told me you were preparing for your citizenship exam that you thought you were going to take when you were detained. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=191.16s)]
*  One of the questions you were going to answer. Just explain that about rights. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=197.68s)]
*  One of the most important questions that was the most important rights is the bill, the bill of rights, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=203.24s)]
*  which includes free speech on the top of his rights, freedom of assembly, freedom of press, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=210.12s)]
*  freedom of having religion or not having religion at all. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=217.4s)]
*  And I learned also in this basically this that I had to study for that the freedom of speech and religion [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=221.28s)]
*  and assembly is guaranteed to everyone in the United States, which is part of the foundation of this country. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, I want you to also, you know, Secretary Rubio, I see your threat to foreign policy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=237.84s)]
*  Can you just tell us what you were hoping for and how you've worked with some of your Jewish brothers and sisters as well as Muslim brothers and sisters? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=243.44s)]
*  My activism. So they are basically he is describing being anti war as anti-Semitic. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=253.32s)]
*  How could that be possible when my partners, most of my partners at Columbia's campus and beyond are Jews and Israelis? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=263.08s)]
*  My work has been centered on peacemaking and all what I'm doing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=271.8s)]
*  I am being a human. My empathy, as I mentioned before, extends beyond the Palestinian people and my empathy extends to the Jews and to the Israelis. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  And my hope and my dream is to see this conflict, if one might say, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=288.48s)]
*  to see an end to the war and end to the killing, to see a peaceful resolution between Palestinians and Israelis. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=296.12s)]
*  How could this be a threat to anybody except the war machine that is feeding this? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=302.8s)]
*  It would be good for everything. Well said. All right. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=307.8s)]
*  I think we that's a good place to stop it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=310.36s)]
*  But it's just that's an incredible anecdote that he talks about how he's studying was studying the Bill of Rights [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=313.08s)]
*  and how the right to free speech and to political speech is supposed to be foundational in this country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=322.48s)]
*  So much so that the right that's now locking up pro-Palestinian demonstrators or anti genocide demonstrators for their speech, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=330.4s)]
*  that they're using it in the same breath, in the same political movement as they're doing it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=339.48s)]
*  Right. So they understand the value of it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=346.6s)]
*  And then they preemptively will claim to be the arbiters of free speech as they do things like this, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=348.88s)]
*  which is why from even a political matter, it is so important to do and for other lawmakers to follow suit with what Senator Peter Welch is doing, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  which is to expand on the moral clarity of standing up for people like Moson and for everybody that is being locked up right now for their political speech. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=364.23999999999995s)]
*  And it's not from by looking at polls and seeing what works, because we know now that based on I think it was Pew Research or Gallup, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=376.88s)]
*  but I think it's Pew that the majority opinion right now in this country is negative views of Israel. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=384.44s)]
*  And that's like 50 percent of Republicans age 18 to 49 and over 70 percent for Democrats in that same cohort. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=390.6s)]
*  So like all of the folks that want to lead with polling first to see like which battles the Democrats need to to fight for are insincere, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=399.28s)]
*  are insincere. Right. Because if they were actually engaging in that exercise, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  they would see that standing up to the Israel lobby would be an absolute slam dunk for them. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=414.4s)]
*  And it is clarifying. It would clarify the issue for people who hear that the right cares about free speech, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=421.47999999999996s)]
*  but may not hear about these other stories or may not be that engaged in politics, even just I'm just appealing to your own self-preservation, you idiots. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=427.04s)]
*  But if an appeal to your morality isn't enough. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=436.56s)]
*  We're pissing away the Bill of Rights for Israel. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=442.04s)]
*  Yeah. Like we're in a way no generate. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=447.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, generations like I mean, like that would. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=450.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, other generations would find shameful. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=456.76000000000005s)]
*  And we have this thing of it's the same way Republicans act like we're supporting women as they take away abortion rights. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=458.76000000000005s)]
*  Yep. And the problem is our foreign policy, our bipartisan foreign policy, particularly vis a vis Israel, is an apartheid policy. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=467.32000000000005s)]
*  And so, yes, when somebody like Moshe Mandawi works and models Israelis and Palestinians working alongside of each other, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=478.52000000000004s)]
*  that is against our foreign policy, because our foreign policy is to remove Palestinians for so Israelis can have more land. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=488.0s)]
*  And you know what? It just it just so happens that all of our bomb makers get a nice big profit off of that, too. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  So, yeah, it's nice. But this needs to be way more. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=501.36s)]
*  And I want to follow the tightrope of applauding everyone who does this and saying, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=505.04s)]
*  where is the senator going down for Ramesa Ozturk? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=511.72s)]
*  Massachusetts. What's going on, Liz? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Elizabeth Warren. It's why has she not gone down and supported her there? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=518.28s)]
*  Same thing again with the senators from from my state with Mahmoud Khalil, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=525.76s)]
*  which is the biggest story on this front, arguably. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=531.7199999999999s)]
*  Just a child just born. He's in prison. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=535.52s)]
*  Yeah. Crickets. And and I'm going to give, of course, Bernie Sanders and AOC some grace because they've been on this tour across the country during this period. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=537.92s)]
*  I imagine their schedules are very full and they've both both been vocal on this. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=547.9599999999999s)]
*  And they mentioned it during the speeches, at least. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=552.1999999999999s)]
*  They did. They should still be. I mean, AOC. Do we have this poll? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=553.92s)]
*  I maybe I just sent it to Sam. I'm going to send it right now. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=559.88s)]
*  There there's a new analysis here of AOC's favorability within the state of New York. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=565.48s)]
*  If we could just go to the quote tweet and then go back to the one I just sent. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=573.64s)]
*  AOC has the opportunity, I think, to run for president or to run for the Senate. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=580.12s)]
*  But there are new numbers that just came out [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  from Sienna research showing her poll numbers in the state. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=589.2399999999999s)]
*  Her net favorability, go to the quote tweet and then even the quote tweet of that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=594.52s)]
*  So we'll just have to go back. Right. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  So go down to her favorability compared to Schumer's. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=599.7199999999999s)]
*  Plus 14, plus 14 in the New York in New York state. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=603.5999999999999s)]
*  Hockels plus one, she's climbed after she's been fighting Trump on congestion pricing. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=609.8s)]
*  I mean, this this negative polarization is saving this woman. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=617.5999999999999s)]
*  She was like kneecapping congestion pricing, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  then was kind of forced into implementing it. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=625.28s)]
*  And now she's defending it against Trump and has gone up by 11 points in favorability. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=627.56s)]
*  Schumer's minus 10. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=632.64s)]
*  Trump is only five points worse than Chuck Schumer in a blue state, New York state. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=635.52s)]
*  And AOC is plus 46 among Democrats Schumer's plus 14. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  This is a real case for her Senate race, and she can make that case by going to visit [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=645.0s)]
*  and highlighting Mamoukaleel. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=649.6s)]
*  Let's go back to some of these other results, too. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=651.0799999999999s)]
*  When you see her favorability among black voters in the state, plus 37. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=653.68s)]
*  Plus 24 among Latinos and the Bernie's [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=660.76s)]
*  campaign didn't do as well with black voters. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=666.04s)]
*  And that's part of what was a hard thing for him to overcome. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=668.8399999999999s)]
*  And then you had Democrats that capitalized on it, specifically more southern [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=672.36s)]
*  conservative black voters don't win. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=676.24s)]
*  Right. And this shows that she maybe has the capacity to even overcome that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  Right. And if Bernie were to run today and he was 10 years younger than he is now, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=685.76s)]
*  I don't think that he would have had those same problems, honestly, that he did. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=689.8399999999999s)]
*  The first time around with some of those voters, because people are more used to [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=694.16s)]
*  Bernie's policies and they've become pretty common sense for, I think, a lot of Democrats. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=698.0s)]
*  But AOC has the opportunity if she chooses to run in New York to defeat Chuck Schumer. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=702.8s)]
*  But if you see these numbers and expand on them on the national level, if that's [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=708.16s)]
*  that holds not that level of support from black voters, but that level of trust that, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=712.08s)]
*  you know, if that expands across state lines, that [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=717.72s)]
*  that's very good for her and puts to bed a lot of these nonsense claims about [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=723.1999999999999s)]
*  the popularity or lack thereof of progressive ideology. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=729.64s)]
*  And I would say puts in stark relief how unpopular being a shill for Israel is. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=734.24s)]
*  Richie Torres plus two percent among black voters, because all he does is talk about [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=739.64s)]
*  anti-Semitism as he defines it, criticism of Israel. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=744.8s)]
*  Exactly. Wow. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=749.0799999999999s)]
*  Chuck Schumer's minus 24 with Latino voters in New York state. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=751.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe it's getting through to some people that having the leader of the [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=755.64s)]
*  Democrats in the Senate of this country [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=758.84s)]
*  telling the press that his job is to keep the left pro-Israel like this is a farce. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=763.6s)]
*  We don't have a democracy. These people need to go. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=768.6s)]
*  And this is and I do appreciate back on the Bernie O.C. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=771.6s)]
*  thing, they're telling people to run for office because these people that are [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=774.92s)]
*  currently in there cannot be trusted, even like they need to be they need to be. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=778.56s)]
*  We need to swamp Congress with a new set of people that are much more severe [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=783.76s)]
*  on this issue to pull those people into line. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=788.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=793.0s)]
*  It is that is a funny result for for for Richie Torres in that broader poll. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=796.76s)]
*  He's at nine percent below Delgado, who's the lieutenant, who was the lieutenant [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=802.8399999999999s)]
*  governor and Torres being down there. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=807.24s)]
*  That's a bad that that's a bad result for him. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=810.0s)]
*  Like. I hope I mean, it would be fascinating. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=812.88s)]
*  I hope he goes through with running for governor and then maybe has to vacate that seat. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=817.32s)]
*  Perhaps it opens up the opportunity for Jamal Bowman to run again, honestly, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=821.52s)]
*  because he was in the district over. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=825.5600000000001s)]
*  But we're just checking to see here if Jeffries was in there, because that's kind of a funny. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=827.44s)]
*  I mean, my guess is this is polling for two races, potential Senate and governor. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=832.6s)]
*  Governor, because Torres is running for is likely running for governor. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=837.0s)]
*  Delgado is to. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=840.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so that's my guess is this is New York [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=844.1600000000001s)]
*  polling for the governor's race coming up and a potential Senate race. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=846.12s)]
*  By the way, don't give Huckle too much credit for the position [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=851.1600000000001s)]
*  that she's just found herself in being the champion of congestion [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=854.88s)]
*  pricing because she's still aiding and abetting the assault on people's free speech [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=858.96s)]
*  with regards to Israel. Absolutely. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=862.76s)]
*  And I would like to know what Delgado's positions are on that front. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=865.36s)]
*  And if he's actually a difference with and because we know Richie Torres [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=868.8000000000001s)]
*  is probably worse than Kathy Hokel on this issue, although she's pretty bad. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=873.52s)]
*  Is Delgado an improvement on that front that might differentiate him in a primary? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=878.64s)]
*  And perhaps he should be clear on that, because if this is just the field [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=883.0400000000001s)]
*  and they're all kind of the same type of politician, I mean, I think Hokel [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=886.52s)]
*  on name recognition is going to an incumbency is going to walk away. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=890.6800000000001s)]
*  He's going to walk away from it with it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=894.04s)]
*  We love our incumbents here in the Northeast for some goddamn reason, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=897.52s)]
*  specifically incumbent governors. They keep getting reelected. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=900.48s)]
*  Also, shout out Michigan, the Senate race there. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=903.04s)]
*  Of course, we are for Abdul El-Sayed. Yep. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=906.92s)]
*  If Haley for Michigan wins by doing her launching her [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=910.92s)]
*  candidacy, saying that [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=916.2s)]
*  she would support unconditional military aid and weapon sales to Israel. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=919.0s)]
*  Being in a apex, we're kind of if she wins, it's a huge problem. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=924.0s)]
*  And I won't be quiet about it. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=927.24s)]
*  Cole for Michigan, AOC, 2028 swamp, the swamp. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=931.0s)]
*  Well, she's leaving her options open. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=935.04s)]
*  I mean, 2028 is also when Schumer is up. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=936.76s)]
*  So any decision that she makes, if it's on the on the presidential [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=940.36s)]
*  or Senate level, is going to likely try to happen at the same time. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=944.48s)]
*  And it's smart for her to continue to leave her options open. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=948.68s)]
*  Ray, Randy Goldberg, China has canceled [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=954.88s)]
*  13 billion dollars worth of soybean orders. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=958.24s)]
*  They made a deal with Brazil instead. There you go. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=960.8s)]
*  This whole thing where the Trump admin conditions people to think [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=965.28s)]
*  this short term pain we're about to see get more and more acute [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=969.12s)]
*  is going to lead to some long term benefit is for rubes. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=972.76s)]
*  What we're going to have is a recession and worse, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=976.4399999999999s)]
*  worse and worse conditions for people unless we take control of the state [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=980.4000000000001s)]
*  and direct investment to social needs and not capitalistic ones. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=984.6s)]
*  Yes, but we will make Brazil great again. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=990.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, China out there saying if you kind of deal with the United States [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=993.24s)]
*  of America, not that like there is any on the horizon, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=997.76s)]
*  because Trump is lying about all that shit. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1000.9200000000001s)]
*  But if you were serious about it, say Japan, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1003.64s)]
*  we're going to retaliate against you. And guess what? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1006.4000000000001s)]
*  Look at a map, which is Japan going to go with there. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1009.16s)]
*  Boom, boom, bitty slurs are OK if they start coming out when you're old. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1014.16s)]
*  Is this all slurs or just gay slurs? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1018.04s)]
*  I'm just saying there's a certain generation of older person [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1019.84s)]
*  that sort of loses their inhibitions as they get older. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1023.64s)]
*  I'm not valorizing the pope. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1027.04s)]
*  I'm just saying that within the context of popes, it wasn't the worst. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1028.8s)]
*  Day from Jamaica, Matt, great point. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1033.32s)]
*  If you're doing scripture debate, people. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1035.08s)]
*  If you're doing scripture debate, people are pretty close to the edge. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1037.76s)]
*  Look, it's worthwhile being [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1042.24s)]
*  familiar with the stories and the morality and lessons. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1045.08s)]
*  But to say like these are signs of an antichrist, I think is that what are we doing? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nadMx9ZZGo&t=1048.28s)]
