# Did Trump Accidentally Admit Israel Killed 500,000 Palestinians In Gaza?
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4)
*  I don't know that you can say people aren't taking this seriously because it has real serious implications. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=0.0s)]
*  And it's unclear. Some people are suggesting that, you know, there is a theory out there that in certain instances, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=5.2s)]
*  Donald Trump, you know, the way that he negotiates is he asks for the the moon to just get the planet Earth, I guess. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Although it's unclear that he gets the planet Earth. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=19.8s)]
*  But he gets to say he gets the planet Earth. He's the PR guy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Pop that meme up just as an example, because before, you know, we need to put proclamations about Gaza in some type of context. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=25.84s)]
*  Yesterday, he was to institute 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=35.28s)]
*  Somebody made this meme, Trudeau says on the phone. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=42.84s)]
*  So I offered him what we've already been doing and he dropped the tariffs and shine by on OMG. Same. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  It's the truth. Yep. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=54.08s)]
*  But, you know, the Republicans are trying to make it into a win because it all is about making his ego feel a certain way [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=55.28s)]
*  so they can get what they want via Project 2025. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  That's really their aims. But I would also say the Israel lobby is trying to make its its. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=64.72s)]
*  I don't think it's even I mean, I don't know that it's about his ego as much as it is, frankly, his constituency, like his base want something to be done. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=70.56s)]
*  But these are the same people who were afraid of a caravan that was going to come and take their homes, their their summer homes on a lake in Minnesota. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=80.44000000000001s)]
*  So the idea that they're being told something was done for a problem that doesn't exist. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean, border crossings are at a 70 percent lower than they were a year and a half ago. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  That reality has not caught up with the people who are convinced that immigrants are ruining the country. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=104.84s)]
*  And so the idea that Trump can say, look at what I've done. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=109.96s)]
*  It may or may not be about his ego. I'm sure it doesn't hurt. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=114.8s)]
*  I mean, the guy's a lunatic. But what it really does is it provides it keeps his base feeling like, thank God, Joe Biden is not here anymore. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=117.36s)]
*  And we're the Lord Savior Trump has helped us. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=127.44s)]
*  Frankly, the Democrats could learn a thing or two from appearing strong as an executive in the presidency, even with his insanity. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=130.56s)]
*  At the very least, he's acting like he's doing things. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=138.28s)]
*  Yes. I mean, the difficulty that Democrats would have is that we would be sitting here instead of like, you know, Charlie Kirk going like, this is amazing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=141.0s)]
*  I can't believe it. Donald Trump has changed the world in three days. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=148.2s)]
*  We would be going, this is BS. They're not addressing our concerns. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=152.28s)]
*  And that's the that's one of the fundamental sort of like issues that we we we just have to reckon with. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=156.96s)]
*  Exactly. Just different people. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=165.84s)]
*  With that said, Donald Trump was meeting with war criminal Bibi Netanyahu in Washington, D.C. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=168.36s)]
*  I'm sorry, accused war criminal by the ICC Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  But also probably war criminal. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=184.4s)]
*  Can we just do the freeze frame for a sec to look at this guy's grin? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=186.08s)]
*  I mean. Just catat it ate the canary. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  Got everything he wanted out of this situation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=194.84s)]
*  Yep. And it's where the Democrats seem more mad at Dearborn voters, the bad guy sometimes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=197.08s)]
*  But I don't know. I mean, the well, let's play this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=204.08s)]
*  Here is Trump alongside the Israeli war criminal. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=218.88s)]
*  Peter, would Palestinians have the right to return to Gaza if they left while the rebuilding was happening? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=221.16s)]
*  It would be my hope that we could do something really nice, really good, where they wouldn't want to return. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  Why would they want to return? The place has been hell. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  It's been one of the meanest. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=237.64s)]
*  I'm sorry. Just pause it for a sec. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  That place has been hell. And then you see him smiling. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu is smiling. Who made it hell? Mission accomplished. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  Who made it hell? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=249.16s)]
*  I just want people, if you're in the podcast audience, if you want to look up this video, it's truly I hesitate to use the word evil because it sounds biblical and silly and medieval. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=250.4s)]
*  No pun intended. But that's the face of evil. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=261.56s)]
*  The place has been hell. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=265.16s)]
*  It's been one of the meanest, one of the meanest, toughest places on earth. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=267.2s)]
*  And right now it's it's I've seen every picture from every angle, better than if I were there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=272.68s)]
*  And nobody can live there. You can't live there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=280.12s)]
*  So we can build we can build them through a massive amounts of money supplied by other people, very rich nations. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  And they'll be they're willing to supply it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=291.24s)]
*  If we can build something for them and one of the countries and it could be Jordan and it could be Egypt, it could be other countries. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  And you could build four or five or six areas. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=300.08s)]
*  It doesn't have to be one area, but you take certain areas and you build really good quality housing, like a beautiful town, like someplace where they can live and not die. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=302.6s)]
*  Because Gaza is a guarantee that they're going to end up dying. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=315.04s)]
*  The same thing is going to happen again. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=317.92s)]
*  It's happened over and over again, and it's going to happen again. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=319.88s)]
*  I sure as you're standing there, Peter. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=323.88s)]
*  So I hope that we can do something where they wouldn't want to go back. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=326.12s)]
*  Who would want to go back? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=330.8s)]
*  They've experienced nothing but death and destruction. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=332.88s)]
*  It's amazing to hear it all in the passive voice. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=337.76s)]
*  As the actor is sitting right next to him, you almost want to go like nothing but death and destruction. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=340.64s)]
*  Am I right? Am I right? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=345.88s)]
*  Like, right? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  Do you throw the elbow over there? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=348.56s)]
*  When you say Peter, you know who's asking that question? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=350.6s)]
*  Peter Ducey. Peter Ducey of Fox News. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=353.76s)]
*  That's an indictment, frankly, on the rest of the press that the Fox News reporter is asking that question, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=355.6s)]
*  the most pertinent question there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  And there was a part after where someone shouted out, it's their home. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=363.0s)]
*  It's their home. So he's he's he's he's envisioning something like five celebrations they have in Florida. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  You hear about one in Jordan, one in Egypt. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=375.88s)]
*  And then what are we going to do with that empty land? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=379.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, we're talking about the right of return to Gaza now after the right of return was basically dismissed, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=382.16s)]
*  meaning people expelled in 48 should be able to root into their homes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=388.52000000000004s)]
*  Everyone said that's the vast majority of people living in Gaza are there because it ended up being a refugee camp [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=392.92s)]
*  from people having to leave their homes in Jerusalem or in parts of the Negev or all throughout what was Palestine at that time. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=402.88s)]
*  And so it's twice removed. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  But. It is unclear, I mean, the only theory I have read as to why Donald Trump is like launching this idea is because. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=422.16s)]
*  He's trying to make it more well, let's listen to this part here, because this is when he talks about basically who would then get the land. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=436.44s)]
*  I mean, if if you were to ethnically cleanse of all the Gazans from Gaza and put them in beautiful little like celebration towns, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=443.96s)]
*  I would call them, you know, or a reservation. You could call it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=453.96s)]
*  Well, but but beautiful reservations, great casinos. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  And if you were to do that, who who would have the land? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=459.96s)]
*  Thank you so much, President Trump. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=465.68s)]
*  Just to follow up on what you were saying there. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=467.04s)]
*  Say it? Go ahead, please. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=469.48s)]
*  Just to follow up on what you were saying about the Gazans leaving Gaza and going to other countries. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=470.64s)]
*  One, where exactly are you suggesting that they should go? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=475.04s)]
*  And two, are you saying they should return after it's rebuilt? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=478.0s)]
*  And if not, who do you envision living there? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=480.88s)]
*  I envision the world, people living there, the world's people. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=484.08s)]
*  I think you'll make that into an international, unbelievable place. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=489.4s)]
*  I think the potential and the Gaza Strip is unbelievable. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=494.48s)]
*  And I think the entire world, representatives from all over the world will be there and they'll and they'll live there. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=498.36s)]
*  Palestinians also Palestinians will live there. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=504.48s)]
*  Many people live there. But they've tried the other and they've tried it for decades and decades and decades. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=507.0s)]
*  It's not going to work. It didn't work. It will never work. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=514.36s)]
*  And you have to learn from history. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=517.64s)]
*  History is, you know, just can't let it keep repeating itself. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=521.0400000000001s)]
*  We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=524.88s)]
*  And I don't want to be cute. I don't want to be a wise guy. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=529.76s)]
*  But the Riviera of the Middle East, this could be something that could be so bad. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=532.64s)]
*  This could be so magnificent. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=536.64s)]
*  But more importantly than that is the people that have been absolutely destroyed that live there now [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=539.08s)]
*  can live in peace in a much better situation because they're living in hell. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=545.12s)]
*  And those people will now be able to live in peace. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=550.9200000000001s)]
*  We'll make sure that it's done world class. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=553.24s)]
*  It'll be wonderful for the people. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=555.64s)]
*  Palestinians, Palestinians, mostly we're talking about. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=557.6s)]
*  And I have a feeling that despite them saying no, I have a feeling that the king in Jordan and. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=561.2s)]
*  So, OK, this is, I think, the clue on some level of of like what what he's angling here for. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=568.48s)]
*  He thinks this is a way to. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  Convince Abdullah and Egypt and I don't know who else he envisions here to take Palestinians in, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=582.2800000000001s)]
*  and we're going to we're going to pay a lot of money. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=592.8800000000001s)]
*  We'll kick back some of that Riviera money and you'll get it and it'll be great. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=595.72s)]
*  And their home. That's why they don't want to leave, buddy. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=601.12s)]
*  Well, their home and and frankly, the king of Jordan doesn't want to not be the king of Jordan. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=603.84s)]
*  And it would be incredibly destabilizing to have a million refugees in his country. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  It's it's unclear. What Trump thinks he's doing here, but it's insanity. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=620.4399999999999s)]
*  It's also, again, it's ethnic cleansing, but it's nice cleansing. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=625.9599999999999s)]
*  It's like, well, he's a really good development. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=631.12s)]
*  Is it ethnic cleansing when we like you go on a vacation? Right. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=634.24s)]
*  He's a real estate developer and a rich guy from birth. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=638.8s)]
*  He doesn't understand any of this. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=642.0s)]
*  And when if what he does understand, it's basically a reflexive Zionism [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=644.36s)]
*  that's racist towards Palestinians as basically every Republican is. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=649.32s)]
*  But he thinks of it as a real estate developer. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=653.48s)]
*  He's excited to get his cut for the beachfront property on Gaza, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=655.6400000000001s)]
*  which has strategic importance for our intelligence, but also is like [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=659.32s)]
*  it's on the water. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=665.84s)]
*  It's like, as he says, prime real estate for capitalists [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=666.9200000000001s)]
*  to build up their luxury hotels and casinos and Kushner's going to get a cut. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=669.96s)]
*  He was saying 10 months ago that the Gaza waterfront could, quote, be very valuable. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=673.6400000000001s)]
*  And now it is valuable. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=678.96s)]
*  And one other thing, he said this at another point in the appearance [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=680.48s)]
*  that one point seven to one point eight million Palestinians will be leaving. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=684.44s)]
*  I'm wondering where he got that figure, because prior to the genocides [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=689.72s)]
*  beginning, it was two point three million. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=693.24s)]
*  And we know that the death toll is much higher than we previously knew. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=695.52s)]
*  That would indicate hundreds of thousands dead already. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=701.0s)]
*  And I just want people to put a pin in that. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  Which has been predicted by people like Ralph Nader. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=707.8s)]
*  Of course. And the doctors that had been there [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=710.12s)]
*  wrote a letter back in October that said it was like at minimum [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=712.0s)]
*  one hundred and eighty six thousand that they could verify. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=714.68s)]
*  Once we understand the full death toll of here, it's going to be another. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=718.24s)]
*  This is an indictment of the Biden administration. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=723.52s)]
*  He midwifed the ability for this far right president [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=725.8s)]
*  to do this kind of thing, because he did. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=730.8s)]
*  Biden didn't listen to his constituency and now Trump's a madman in BB's pocket. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=732.76s)]
*  And they're going to go to town. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=737.36s)]
*  We'll talk more about this later in the program. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=740.44s)]
*  One of the things we just don't even mention is that I don't know. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=743.24s)]
*  Did Trump even get a question about the ICC? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=745.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, and if he did, he gets buried by this. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=748.72s)]
*  I mean, but that's what we're dealing with. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x7Nyu8PVn4&t=750.84s)]
