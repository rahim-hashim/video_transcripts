# Ex-Israeli Defense Chief Admits Israel Guilty Of Ethnic Cleansing
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg)
*  New York Times reports that Israel is building bases in the north of Gaza, which is what you do [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=0.0s)]
*  if you want to occupy Gaza, which apparently is what they want to do. It was a bloody weekend [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=8.32s)]
*  in Gaza. They killed three workers from the World Central Kitchen, one of whom they claim [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=15.68s)]
*  was a member of Hamas or was involved in the October 7th attacks. The other two, you know, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=26.32s)]
*  33% kill rate there, whatever. I mean, that's even based on their own sort of like, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  who knows whether that's true or not. The- Yeah, there's no evidence for the- [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=40.32s)]
*  Look, why would they need evidence? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=47.84s)]
*  I mean, World Central Kitchen, the only reason they're even there is because Israel presented [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=51.84s)]
*  no evidence but made this claim that UNRWA was Hamas. So like the main infrastructure for aid [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=57.28s)]
*  and food delivery was basically kicked out. And the United States followed suit by immediately [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=65.68s)]
*  defunding UNRWA and Biden and the Republicans and many Democrats were on board. That was as the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=72.72s)]
*  ICC was making its first announcements. It was, I would say, correlated to that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=77.28s)]
*  And so they have to rely on these nonprofits to go in there and basically try to feed people. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=81.76s)]
*  And now this is what, the third time that this particular nonprofit, at least the second time, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=89.68s)]
*  but I think there was a third instance of this particular nonprofit being targeted. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=94.72s)]
*  But most importantly, at least in terms of the news over the past couple of days, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=100.48s)]
*  this is going to come as something that's very difficult for people who have been complaining [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=109.2s)]
*  about the idea that Israel has been engaging in acts of genocide in Gaza. If you were one of those [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  people who really repels at the use of the word genocide, then you will be very, very comforted [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=125.12s)]
*  to know that the former IDF Defense Minister, I should say the former Israeli Defense Minister [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=134.0s)]
*  and a former IDF chief, Moshe Yalan, says that Israel is engaged in ethnic cleansing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=144.24s)]
*  So this will be able, you will be able, if you are one of those people who take issue [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=158.4s)]
*  with the use of genocide by genocide experts, you will now be able to brag that Israel is only engaged [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=163.04s)]
*  in ethnic cleansing. This coming from a guy who worked [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=169.68s)]
*  decades in the Israeli national security state in about three or four years for a guy named [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu. Okay, this is subtitles. I'll read it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  Okay, go back to the beginning, please. Who is in favor of separatism? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  Go ahead. This has nothing to do with the right or left. In favor of separatism and not a dual [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=197.6s)]
*  national state, an apartheid state, or to follow the path that we are now being led into, to conquer [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  annex and to purify an ethnic identity, to look at the north of the border, to transfer, to call [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=210.0s)]
*  it whatever you want, and to settle in a Jewish settlement. That's the point. Now if we look at [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  the numbers, 70% in most areas, sometimes more, sometimes a little less. Two-thirds of the public [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=223.04s)]
*  in the state of Israel are in favor, first of all, of a liberal democratic Jewish state and so on, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=229.76s)]
*  of separation as well. And so here we must not get confused, because the one who wants to confuse [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=237.2s)]
*  us is the one who's leading us at the moment, to no less than destruction. You said a bunch of words [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=242.32s)]
*  that I never thought I would hear from you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=248.32s)]
*  Ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip. Do you think we're on the right track? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=254.32s)]
*  Why on the right track? What's going on there? What's going on there? This is no baitleaf. This [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=258.64s)]
*  is no bait to Hanan. They are apparently operating in Jebala. And in fact, they're cleansing the area [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=264.32s)]
*  from, I couldn't catch the word. From Arabs. From Arabs. Yes. So in other words, ethnic cleansing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=269.92s)]
*  Martin Shaw, our author, he said, as I argued in my 2007 book, What is a Genocide? Force [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=276.96s)]
*  displacement is a means of genocide omitted from the Genocide Convention because the UN great powers [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=281.76s)]
*  were condoning removals in Europe, India, and Palestine. And ethnic cleansing was a euphemism [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=286.96s)]
*  for it. So the only reason ethnic cleansing isn't considered genocide is that historical [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=291.68s)]
*  contingency of the late 40s. But also, you know, because folks get so technical with this, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  the definition of genocide in terms of international law are acts of genocide, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=301.84s)]
*  individual acts of genocide. It is not a defense to say Israel could nuke the entire country or the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=310.79999999999995s)]
*  entire occupied territory of Gaza, but they're not. So they're not committing genocide. That's just [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  baby brain. It would also eliminate most genocides in the history of the world that we do [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=325.2s)]
*  legally classify as genocide, whether it be in Bosnia and Herzegovina or whether it be, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, China, China with the Uyghurs, whether it be the our own, yeah, the Armenian genocide, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=340.56s)]
*  right? Like, I mean, this is pretty clear. Don't I've repeated this many times, but if people want [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  available, just look up Article Two on the Convention and Prevention and punishment of the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  crimes of genocide. It basically means if you do any of these five, it can constitute a genocidal [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=360.72s)]
*  act killing members of the group causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=367.76s)]
*  deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  destruction in whole or in part, imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=376.48s)]
*  forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. You can 100% make the case that [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=381.04s)]
*  Israel has done the first four many, many times over the forcible transfer of children. You could [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=387.44s)]
*  even make that case with given how they imprison Palestinian children without recourse and many of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  them have gone missing. So there's no reality in which they don't meet the standard for genocide. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=401.20000000000005s)]
*  People that are saying otherwise are just trying to lie to you at this point. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=408.4s)]
*  And here, just to cap this off, this is one of the weirdest things. I don't know what's going on with [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=411.84s)]
*  this. Let's put up this tweet. This is number 11. Joe Biden after sitting after basically [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=417.52s)]
*  handmaidening or I should say midwifing this ethnic cleansing, if you want to go by [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=430.32s)]
*  a former Israeli secretary of defense type of guy or genocide by every expert who studies genocide [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  or whatever, however you want to call it, this slaughter, this just absolute catastrophe for [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=447.12s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza, not to mention what's going on in the West Bank. A year and change into this, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  incidentally, I would also say as a political matter, probably contributed heavily to, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I think without a doubt contributed heavily to Harris's loss. Was it determinant? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=475.76000000000005s)]
*  I don't know. Nobody's ever going to know. But here he is leaving a bookstore in Nantucket. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=480.88s)]
*  And I'm sorry. You don't, this is not on purpose. This is on purpose. And I don't know what the hell [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=488.4s)]
*  it's supposed to signify. Honestly, like, first off, this guy's not carrying his stuff out of like [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=499.67999999999995s)]
*  other stores. They'd give you a bag. If I was working for the bookstore, I'd be like, here, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=505.76s)]
*  it has a bag. It has our name on it. Now he's carrying this book out. And I don't know what, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=511.76s)]
*  like- A hundred years war on Palestine, the history of settler colonialism and resistance [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=519.2s)]
*  by Rashid Khalidi. I literally have given this to family members because it's a great place to start [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=524.08s)]
*  on the issue of Palestine. And, you know, Biden with no time left in his presidency- [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=529.12s)]
*  I thought I'd finally read into it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=535.36s)]
*  Time to get educated. I mean, I don't know what to make of this. I saw this before I saw, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=537.6s)]
*  I saw a headline or a pool reporter had tweeted out like, Biden just walked out of a Nantucket [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=541.84s)]
*  bookstore holding Rashid Khalidi's book. And I was like, is this the onion? I missed this bit. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=548.48s)]
*  And then there's a photo of it. I don't know what this is supposed to signify. I don't, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=557.52s)]
*  I don't know if he's, if it's a troll- It kind of feels like a troll to me, but I don't know. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=562.72s)]
*  I don't think he's capable of trolling at this point. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=568.48s)]
*  But there's this picture, I pull this up, it's a similar, the same sort of genre, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=573.76s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard. You're going to have to make that picture smaller broadly so we can see the whole [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=578.24s)]
*  thing. So her with a book, JFK and the unspeakable, which is a JFK- [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=581.44s)]
*  Oh, that is, RFK recommends that book. It's actually not a bad book. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=589.92s)]
*  He recommends that book. That's the one that RFK recommends. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=593.36s)]
*  It's a little bit religious themed, but it's not a bad book. But the funny thing is, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=596.56s)]
*  is Tulsi was later asked for to review it and it was very clear she had really no idea what [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=600.4s)]
*  was going on. Well, RFK told her to buy it. And because he actually, I asked him what was [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=604.8s)]
*  the best book. He blurbed it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=611.52s)]
*  Yeah. I asked him what he thought the best one was. And he said that one. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=612.24s)]
*  But she's trying to signal deep state right there. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=614.88s)]
*  Exactly. That's all it was. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=616.9599999999999s)]
*  But what is Biden trying to signal? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=618.1600000000001s)]
*  That is the big mystery. What does this guy think he's doing? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=620.64s)]
*  I just want my- [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=624.8000000000001s)]
*  Looking for tips? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=626.88s)]
*  I've written a book. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  Now we're sure that he's not just returning it. Maybe it was like a present. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=632.64s)]
*  I got it for Thanksgiving, man. I don't need it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=639.12s)]
*  I don't know what it means. I mean, is he that cruel that he's trolling it, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=643.0400000000001s)]
*  trolling and rubbing it in people's face? That's a possibility given his actions. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=646.8s)]
*  Psycho stuff. It's either insanely cruel or insanely stupid. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=650.56s)]
*  There's no- Yeah, exactly. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6iciLQCuSg&t=654.64s)]
