# Ben Shapiro Burned By Old Tweet After Defending Trump's Plan To Ethnically Cleanse Gaza
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM)
*  Ben Shapiro is weighing in on Donald Trump's plans to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=0.0s)]
*  Actually, let's just pull up his tweet from 2010. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=4.88s)]
*  As a primer, a little appetizer. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=6.88s)]
*  Just in case you were confused about where Ben Shapiro stands on this issue. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=8.88s)]
*  He is a unrepentant racist. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=14.88s)]
*  Well, I mean half repentant. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=17.84s)]
*  This tweet Israelis like to build... [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=19.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Arabs... [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  They just destroyed the entire Gaza Strip. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Who gave them the money to build? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=28.24s)]
*  This is not a difficult issue. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=31.2s)]
*  This and hashtag settlements rock. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=32.56s)]
*  So that hashtag encouraging war crimes, which is what the settlements are. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=34.0s)]
*  You can't take land that was conquered. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=39.2s)]
*  This is one of the tweets that he put in his I'm sorry for bad things I did in the past [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=42.64s)]
*  document that he had on his website for a while and then he put it behind a paywall [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=50.2s)]
*  along with him saying, what's that guy's name from Iowa? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  Steve King isn't a racist and people have been woke by calling him one. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=57.96s)]
*  Well, maybe he's self-reflected. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=62.44s)]
*  I mean, if he did apologize at one point for saying hashtag settlements rock and that Arabs [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=64.2s)]
*  live in like to bomb things and live in open sewage, maybe he's he's he's reevaluated. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=72.28s)]
*  President Trump's most audacious move has been his attempt to solve the situation in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=81.8s)]
*  Gaza by allowing people who are in a rubble strewn area, a way out so that the Gaza Strip [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=87.08s)]
*  can then be rebuilt as basically Monte Carlo on the Mediterranean. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=92.24s)]
*  Everybody who is opposing this, everybody who's yelling about this, their solution is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=97.96s)]
*  no solution. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=101.8s)]
*  Their solution, of course, is to simply allow the rebuilding of Hamasistan in the Gaza Strip [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=102.8s)]
*  and suffering. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=107.92s)]
*  OK, so your solution is ethnic cleansing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=110.24s)]
*  And you talk about, yeah, it's rubble. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=112.64s)]
*  He's they're doing exactly what the Netanyahu, you know, Likud playbook is, is, well, it's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=114.64s)]
*  destroyed. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=121.52s)]
*  What do you they can't live there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=122.52s)]
*  Who destroyed it? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=124.28s)]
*  So Ben Shapiro cheered on the destruction of the Gaza Strip for a year and a half. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=125.84s)]
*  Over 90 percent of the homes destroyed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=132.36s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=135.28s)]
*  We still don't know the true figures, but it's certainly over the Lancet estimate at [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=136.32s)]
*  this point of one hundred and eighty thousand Palestinians and somewhere in between the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=141.04s)]
*  deficit that Trump. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=145.84s)]
*  Blurred it out in that press conference, which would have indicated five hundred thousand. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=148.04s)]
*  It's somewhere around in between those two ranges. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=152.16s)]
*  Ben Shapiro cheered on that wholesale slaughter, that genocide. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=156.12s)]
*  And now that basically they've done enough and left the hostages, you didn't you have [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  to launch this, admit this, that the Israeli government prolonged the war in Gaza when [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=168.44s)]
*  they could have gotten the hostages back because basically they wanted to make Gaza. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=175.44s)]
*  They needed more time to make Gaza uninhabitable so that they could do the ethnic cleansing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=179.32s)]
*  that Shapiro says is the only solution. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  We want to add a different word before a solution. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=186.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, Ben wants to find a solution for Palestinians. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  They would happily not have like he will. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=193.88000000000002s)]
*  He knows his job when the time comes, whenever Israel starts massacring is to justify it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  And it's interesting to see some of the people in his stable. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=202.96s)]
*  Probably pretty cynically, probably with an eye toward contract negotiations, try to buck [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  it. Or you have people like Dave Smith that are like purport to be critics of Israel that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=212.96s)]
*  did the rounds a little bit last year. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=217.84s)]
*  Everyone folding in. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=219.32s)]
*  And this is what actually is spoken for by the right wing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  Simply allow the rebuilding of Hamas is stand in the Gaza Strip and the suffering of the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=226.44s)]
*  people who live there for decades. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=231.76s)]
*  That's also what they really are. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=233.56s)]
*  Sorry. No, we do actually have a solution. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=234.84s)]
*  Don't pretend that we don't. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=237.76s)]
*  One democratic state from the river to the sea, the reality that already exists, the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=239.44s)]
*  three million Palestinians that are in the ghetto of the West Bank, that's land is being [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=245.72s)]
*  encroached upon on a daily basis that is controlled by Israel. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=251.84s)]
*  You've got to make them citizens. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=255.88s)]
*  You've got to make them citizens. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=257.76s)]
*  And then the now reduced number due to genocide in Gaza, the one point seven or one point [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=259.32s)]
*  eight million people that may still be alive, their lives forever, just tarnished by the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=266.72s)]
*  carnage and the trauma of what they've witnessed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=271.72s)]
*  They also have to be full citizens, too. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=274.24s)]
*  And damn, your demographic majority may not be that pronounced. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=276.4s)]
*  But sorry, you got to go, by the way, is South Africa. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=281.6s)]
*  And apartheid is wrong. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=285.12s)]
*  Deal with it. So when you pretend we don't have solutions, we do. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=287.08s)]
*  You just don't like it. Your solution is the final solution. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=290.12s)]
*  And in the meantime, in the time preceding eventual one state sort of anti apartheid [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=293.48s)]
*  regime, which we can all dream about. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=300.0s)]
*  How about who gets to govern the Palestinians is whoever the Palestinians vote for, even [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=304.48s)]
*  if that is. Amos, Aaron Rupar tweeted this out last May. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=310.84s)]
*  I have no problem saying Palestine. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=317.84s)]
*  I support a two state solution. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=320.2s)]
*  The problem is getting there. Who is going to govern Gaza? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=321.6s)]
*  Certainly not Hamas. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=324.32s)]
*  And I also support Israel's right to exist. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=325.8s)]
*  So that's that. That is really more than October 7th. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=328.16s)]
*  It is they don't like the groups. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  And before it was Hamas, it was the PLO. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=334.2s)]
*  Whoever is organized to oppose Israel's land grabbing and genocide will be [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  justifiably to all these Zionists killed and will have will open up war [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  to get rid of them. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=351.4s)]
*  It's not politics because you always hear about the stuff. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  Elections have consequences. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=355.23999999999995s)]
*  The consequence for the last election that Palestinians held was that Israel [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=357.67999999999995s)]
*  said, oh, you can't do it like that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=361.76s)]
*  We're going to try to coup you all and then we're going to occupy you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=364.24s)]
*  Yeah. Rashida Tlaib tweeted this in response to what Trump did. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  Palestinians aren't going anywhere. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=374.52s)]
*  The president can only spew this fanatical bullshit because of bipartisan supporting [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=375.88s)]
*  Congress for funding genocide and ethnic cleansing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=380.0s)]
*  It's time for my two state solution colleagues to speak up. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=381.88s)]
*  I was happy to see her say that because I, you know, Matt and I, I think have both been [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=385.36s)]
*  kind of pushing this like when are there going to be squad members that talk about [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=389.24s)]
*  the reality of what is actually happening? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=393.36s)]
*  It's not there's there's no a two state solution was always a stalling tactic [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=395.36s)]
*  for Israel to expand its territory. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=399.0s)]
*  We have to meet this moment with what is true, which is that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=400.92s)]
*  there already is a one state reality and Palestinians live in subjugation [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=406.08s)]
*  under that one state reality. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=410.16s)]
*  And so I appreciated, as always, Rashida Tlaib leading the way on this issue. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=411.44s)]
*  Let's keep going. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=416.36s)]
*  The strip and the suffering of the people who live there for decades on end. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=417.92s)]
*  You know, they really nothing with no money and no jobs. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=422.56s)]
*  That is their solution. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=426.08s)]
*  Trump is proposing an alternative. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=427.04s)]
*  He is also making clear that contra the sort of idiotic opinion that America is going to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=429.08s)]
*  send troops to do this. No, we're not. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=434.28s)]
*  And we shouldn't wait, obviously, we shouldn't be taking refugees from the Syrian nor should [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=435.88s)]
*  we be sending him. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=440.4s)]
*  He did. He suggested it first, but he walked it back. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=441.28s)]
*  It came out of nowhere. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=444.16s)]
*  It wasn't anywhere before one person said that and it was Donald Trump who said that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=446.28s)]
*  and BB loved it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=451.8s)]
*  So if it's so idiotic, I mean, yeah, Trump blurted it out, but he's got a retcon. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=452.76s)]
*  We shouldn't, obviously, we shouldn't be taking in refugees from this area, nor should [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=457.8s)]

*  Of course, of course. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=464.72s)]
*  Caroline Lovett of the White House, she was asked about this by members of the media. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=467.24s)]
*  Are you risking American lives in Gaza? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=472.2s)]
*  And she said, what are you even talking about? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=473.68s)]
*  I'm 27. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=477.0s)]
*  We're risking the life of a single US Marine to turn the Gaza Strip into the Riviera of [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=477.68s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=482.88s)]
*  So I'm not sure why you're asking me that question, because I've already said the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=483.40000000000003s)]
*  president has not committed to sending Marines or any boots on the ground in Gaza. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=486.24s)]
*  Sorry, so it didn't commit to never doing it, which was a follow up to that question. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=491.92s)]
*  I don't know why they couldn't find time for it in in Ben Shapiro's thing, but she's [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=497.52s)]
*  explicitly asked, like, OK, so is he ruling it out? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=502.28s)]
*  I don't know. We'll get back on. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=504.67999999999995s)]
*  I don't know why I have to keep doing this again, responding to the words of the president [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=506.08s)]
*  as the presidential spokesperson. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, like, you're you're you're so irrational. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=511.76s)]
*  Stop putting this upon me. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  And the Marines or any boots on the ground in Gaza. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=518.1999999999999s)]
*  OK, so again, they made that clear. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=522.76s)]
*  Trump himself made that clear this morning. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=524.92s)]
*  He put out a statement, quote, The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=527.56s)]
*  by Israel at the conclusion of fighting the Palestinians. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=530.92s)]
*  People like Chuck Schumer. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=533.64s)]
*  But I'm for it would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=536.4s)]
*  communities with new and modern homes in the region. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  They would actually have a chance to be happy, safe and free. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=542.56s)]
*  The U.S. working with great development teams from all over the world would slowly and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=544.76s)]
*  carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=547.68s)]
*  spectacular developments of its kind on Earth. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  No soldiers by the U.S. would be needed. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=552.56s)]
*  Stability for the region would reign. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  Again, President Trump sees this as a real estate project. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  He's a real estate guy. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=558.28s)]
*  What he is basically saying is Israel should clear the ground. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=559.6s)]
*  People who want to leave should be allowed to get out and go live somewhere that is [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=562.1999999999999s)]
*  not, in fact, a hellhole run by Hamas. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=565.96s)]
*  And then the United States will basically. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=568.68s)]
*  Sorry, Paz. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=571.04s)]
*  This is they can't be honest. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=573.36s)]
*  The people give an opportunity allowed to leave. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  They want to stay there. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=579.76s)]
*  You fucking rabid Zionist. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=580.92s)]
*  They want to stay in the land. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=582.76s)]
*  You want to expel them out. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=584.24s)]
*  And notice how he laughs about the joke, like the forced laughter about the joke [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=586.28s)]
*  about calling Schumer a Palestinian, which Trump has repeatedly done, referring to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=590.04s)]
*  Palestinian as a slur, because he can't as a non-Jewish person call Schumer a bad [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=593.92s)]
*  Jew. But that's why for mildly criticizing Netanyahu. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=598.96s)]
*  But but but Trump feels like he can't say it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=607.76s)]
*  But Ben Shapiro thinks it's funny because that's how he feels about anybody who is [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=611.2s)]
*  Jewish, who doesn't support Israel and isn't a Zionist. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=614.72s)]
*  And he confirms Zionist is this this much of a bigot. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=617.4s)]
*  And actually even the one that says Israel's like to build. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=620.44s)]
*  Israelis like to build. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=623.32s)]
*  Arabs like to live in sewage. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=624.6s)]
*  Right. Zionism. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=626.24s)]
*  And apparently, if you are repulsed by that, you're the bigot in Ben Shapiro's [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=627.2s)]
*  worldview. You're the anti-Semite. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=631.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Uncle Sam is going to protect the little snowflakes that listen to Ben [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=633.5600000000001s)]
*  Shapiro across college campuses, make sure they aren't exposed to any kind of [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  counter messaging about the propaganda that they have been abused with by [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=641.6s)]
*  Zionist education throughout their childhood. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=646.5200000000001s)]
*  And yeah, I want safe spaces. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=649.6400000000001s)]
*  The one place that we cannot have that is people who were abused with [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  frankly, overly emphasizing trauma and how sick the world is. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=657.08s)]
*  Look, I understand that that that the Holocaust takes up a big spot in people's [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=661.36s)]
*  historical memory, using it to forward a ethno-nationalist [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=666.76s)]
*  fascist colony has been a fucking disaster and everyone can see it now. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=671.64s)]
*  And it's a disgrace to the memory of the Holocaust to commit genocide in the name [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=677.08s)]
*  of the Holocaust. I mean, I don't know how we have to like how clear we have to be. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=680.84s)]
*  Yakov Rivkin, Enemies from Within, a book about Jewish resistance to [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=685.44s)]
*  Zionism is one that I think more and more people should check out. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=690.48s)]
*  Peter Beinart has a new book out and hopefully we have a monsoon where he talks [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=693.76s)]
*  about, you know, like the reaction to this genocide as a Jewish person. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=697.08s)]
*  And he speaks about it. He speaks. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=701.12s)]
*  I mean, look, any you can. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=703.52s)]
*  There are many, many Jewish historians and intellectuals who speak out about this. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  But Ben Shapiro would say that they're bad Jews because they don't support [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=709.64s)]
*  genocide. And the other the other. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=713.12s)]
*  I had another point, again, my brain's falling apart. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=718.36s)]
*  Maybe when Trump's truth social comes up, it'll remind me. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=721.12s)]
*  Keep going. Just go back like 10 seconds. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=723.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=726.16s)]
*  He's a real estate guy. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=728.5600000000001s)]
*  What he is basically saying is Israel should clear the ground. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=729.88s)]
*  People who want to leave should be allowed to get out and go live somewhere that is [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=732.52s)]
*  not, in fact, a hellhole run by Hamas. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=736.28s)]
*  And then the United States will basically take the thing that's good about the area, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=739.0s)]
*  meaning the beachfront property and turn it into something nice as a good [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=744.6s)]
*  investment. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=749.24s)]
*  Something that basically going to syndicate a real estate deal in Gaza is the thing that [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  Trump is saying, not that he's going to pour 20,000 American troops, God forbid, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=754.24s)]
*  into the Gaza Strip in order to clear out Hamas. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=758.0s)]
*  He's saying that's Israel's job. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=761.12s)]
*  Let Israel do its job. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=762.2800000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=763.72s)]
*  Hamas that let do and then give people who are living in the worst. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=764.44s)]
*  We're good. That was what I wanted to say is Shapiro is working overtime to maintain [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=767.72s)]
*  this fiction that Trump is antiwar. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=774.88s)]
*  Because that is like what some of his new fans say they like about him. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=778.08s)]
*  So he's doing that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=784.52s)]
*  Democrats abandoned that shit. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=785.32s)]
*  Right. So he's doing PR for it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=786.28s)]
*  How long is that going to last? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=789.04s)]
*  It's so desperate. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=792.08s)]
*  And the guy who said he was going to end the Ukraine Russia thing by telling Vladimir [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=794.08s)]
*  Putin to knock it off, but instead said, maybe we should do some more conscription and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=800.12s)]
*  give us some of your minerals. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=803.64s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=805.88s)]
*  If you want these missiles to keep coming. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=806.88s)]
*  Could we just really quickly listen to what Trump said again? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=808.92s)]
*  Yeah, just I would like just because I want I want you to just listen to it here to [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=812.48s)]
*  consider how Shapiro is adamant. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=816.72s)]
*  So Adam and saying that no no personnel from America would possibly be needed in Gaza [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=819.76s)]
*  based off of what Trump and his press secretary. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=825.64s)]
*  Yeah, let's listen to Trump's own words to see if everyone's being hysterical. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=827.92s)]
*  And they can live out their lives in peace and harmony instead of having to go back and [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=832.1999999999999s)]
*  do it again. The U.S. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=836.16s)]
*  will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it to will own it and be [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=838.0s)]
*  responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=844.0799999999999s)]

*  Level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=854.24s)]
*  and housing for the people of the area. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=859.96s)]
*  Do a real job. Do something different. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=863.8000000000001s)]
*  Just can't go back. If you go back, it's going to end up the same way it has for 100 [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=866.2s)]
*  years. I'm hopeful. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=870.4000000000001s)]
*  So to be clear, can you can can we can the United States remotely on remove unexploded [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=873.8000000000001s)]
*  bombs and remove demolished buildings? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=879.76s)]
*  Can the United States rebuild? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=882.88s)]
*  Can you can physical structures remotely? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=884.96s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=888.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=890.0400000000001s)]
*  Is that reporter in the White House press briefing room, the dumbest person on the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=891.5600000000001s)]
*  planet for asking how this is going to happen with through a computer screen or a [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bpJzq1TM&t=895.0s)]
