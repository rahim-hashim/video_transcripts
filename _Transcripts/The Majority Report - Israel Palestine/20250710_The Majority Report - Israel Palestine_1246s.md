# Trump & Israel's Ethnic Cleansing Plan For Gaza "Riviera"
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8)
*  This is Donald Trump meeting with Bibi Netanyahu as they have the fascist off and decide how they're going to ethnically cleanse Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=0.0s)]
*  Are they going to call it the Gaza Riviera? Are they going to allow any Palestinians to live in Gaza so that they can work at the Trump hotels? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=8.0s)]
*  Whatever it is. Here is... Is this number four? Which clip is this? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=16.0s)]
*  I got him talking about Mom Donnie. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=21.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's start with that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=24.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=25.0s)]
*  Is that something you take seriously or are you concerned about that? Do you have a response to that? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=26.0s)]
*  No, no, I'm not concerned about that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=40.0s)]
*  I'll get him out. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=42.0s)]
*  Look, there's enough craziness in the world, but I guess it never ends. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=44.0s)]
*  I mean, you have... This is a falling and it's silly in many ways because it's just not serious. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=49.0s)]
*  But what is serious is the question I was asked before. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=58.0s)]
*  You know, after October 7th, people said the Palestinians out of state, Hamas state in Gaza, and look what they did with it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=60.0s)]
*  They didn't build it up. They built down into bunkers, into terror tunnels, after which they massacred our people, raped our women, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=66.0s)]
*  beheaded our men, invaded our cities and our towns and our kibbutzim and did horrendous, horrendous massacres, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=74.0s)]
*  the kind of which we didn't see since World War II and the Nazis, the Holocaust. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=83.0s)]
*  So people aren't likely to say, let's just give them another state. It'll be a platform to destroying Israel. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=87.0s)]
*  We'll work out a peace... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=93.0s)]
*  You talking about Zorah here? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=96.0s)]
*  ...neighbors, those who don't want to destroy us. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=97.0s)]
*  And we'll work out a peace in which our security, the sovereign power of security, always remains in our hands. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=100.0s)]
*  Now, people will say it's not a complete state. It's not a state. It's not that. We don't care. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=107.0s)]
*  You know, we vowed never again. Never again is now. It's not going to happen again. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=112.0s)]
*  So we'll see you in New York next year? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=118.0s)]
*  Oh, well, look, I'm going to come there with President Trump and we'll see what the... [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=120.0s)]
*  How do you know who the mayor will be? I don't know that. Do we know that? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=128.0s)]
*  He's going to be very fine. And who knows? We don't know who the mayor is going to be yet. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=131.0s)]
*  But this is a communist. He's not a socialist. He's a communist. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=136.0s)]
*  And he said some really bad things about Jewish people. And he said some really bad things about a lot of people. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=139.0s)]
*  And I think he's going through a little bit of a honeymoon right now, but he might make it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=146.0s)]
*  But, you know, it all comes through the White House. He needs the money through the White House. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=150.0s)]
*  He needs a lot. He's going to behave. He'll behave. He better behave. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=154.0s)]
*  Otherwise, he's going to have big problems. But it's a philosophy that this country is not ready for and it never will be. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=157.0s)]
*  By the way, we have a man with us. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=163.0s)]
*  I mean, a good follow up question. Like, what did he say about Jews? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=165.0s)]
*  Although that was less offensive than what Kirsten Gillibrand said, saying that he endorsed global jihad. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=172.0s)]
*  Yeah. I love that he's like, no, I'm going to underfund America's finance capital, the world's finance capital, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=177.0s)]
*  because Zoram Umdani might be mayor at the behest of Israel. You know? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=187.0s)]
*  I would hope that Umdani would then shut off water to Trump Tower. That's what I would like to see happen. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=193.0s)]
*  Yeah, I. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=199.0s)]
*  It is just incredibly twisted. But of course, you know, the question is brought up because that was made such a focal point of the mayor's campaign. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=202.0s)]
*  I don't see how they, I mean, obviously they're going to complain about the city not being handing over immigrants. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=215.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't you follow what the International Criminal Court says at that point? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=225.0s)]
*  Yeah, we want to get out these violent, dangerous immigrant criminals. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=231.0s)]
*  I mean, who's a bigger violent, dangerous immigrant criminal than Benjamin Netanyahu? That's the real criminal. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=235.0s)]
*  The level of explicitness now sitting across from the president, it has been the policy of the United States, supposedly, of a two state solution. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=242.0s)]
*  I think that is, you know, a little absurd. We have a we have a single state now in Israel. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=252.0s)]
*  It's an apartheid state with varying degrees of apartheid, some actually, you know, even maybe even worse than apartheid, constant slaughter, more akin to Warsaw ghetto at this point. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=259.0s)]
*  But that there is no news associated with with Netanyahu saying like that's off the table. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=274.0s)]
*  That was supposedly a U.S. standing policy and it's gone. It's not even people don't even pretend anymore. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=283.0s)]
*  It shows the hollowness of liberal Zionism and how in practice for our government, the two state solution thing was abiding a time tactic or at the very least a detente. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=290.0s)]
*  And then for for for for the actual reality for the state project of Israel, it's always been one state, but with like a lot less Palestinians. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=303.0s)]
*  And we do that in a few different ways. It's also just like, I mean, just because we're on the topic of it, I find it really upsetting to see how within the Democratic Party and within the context of this race, they're really trying to use right wing, almost great replacement theory level politics about this city by conflating Zoran's Muslim identity with anti-Semitism or people's fear of him that he's going to be a Muslim. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=313.0s)]
*  And I think that's the kind of thing that is imbued with racism and their reaction to that and experiencing that as anti-Semitism and calling it anti-Semitism when it's really their own bigotry and trying to leverage that into a heavily racialized attack on him. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=343.0s)]
*  And I would include Cuomo's mispronunciation of his name, which is exactly, by the way, what the right did with Kamala Harris the entire election last time. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=359.0s)]
*  And they're doing this within the Democratic primary and there's little to no leadership from national Democrats on this front calling out this like incredible racism. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=368.0s)]
*  I mean, his life, his safety is in danger because of the abdication of Democratic leaders. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=378.0s)]
*  I think. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=384.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=385.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=386.0s)]
*  I also do find it odd that the Democratic Party for the past year, or at least like in the aftermath of the election, have run numerous studies at this point, spending tens of millions of dollars trying to figure out how to reach out to young men and how to mobilize the masses as they once were able to do. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=387.0s)]
*  And then now you do actually have a Joe Rogan of the left is Zoran Mondani. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=411.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have you also you I mean, you literally have an African socialist Muslim man this time around, like the real Obama. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=417.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden, none of the liberals that would that would that would back him are out there defending him at all. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=426.0s)]
*  This is a moment where I think that may turn here is this clip number eight. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=434.0s)]
*  This is a video podcaster, Jennifer Welch. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=441.0s)]
*  I mean, we saw her. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=445.0s)]
*  Oh, she's a good friend of mine. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=446.0s)]
*  She's been on my podcast before. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=448.0s)]
*  I've had it ladies. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=452.0s)]
*  She's pretty like like normie coded. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=453.0s)]
*  Let's put it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=458.0s)]
*  They are from Oklahoma and they definitely are like they are definitely a lot more progressive than the average Democrat. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=459.0s)]
*  But I know for a fact that the Democratic Party really wanted to use them as like this this this non hostile space. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=467.0s)]
*  I mean, they've interviewed Barack Obama. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=475.0s)]
*  They've interviewed Huckum Jeffries in the past. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=477.0s)]
*  And what's his face? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=479.0s)]
*  God, I. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=481.0s)]
*  God, I've heard the chief of staff for Obama. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=486.0s)]
*  Romano, you know, yeah, and got eviscerated on there. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=491.0s)]
*  And here she is on Huckum Jeffries. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=496.0s)]
*  That same, you know, issue. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=500.0s)]
*  Our nominee is going to have to convince folks that he is prepared to aggressively address the rise in anti-Semitism in the city of New York, which has been an unacceptable development. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=504.0s)]
*  And OK, first of all, he has addressed the rise of anti-Semitism and it's not performative. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=515.0s)]
*  It's very, very real. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=520.0s)]
*  He understands that it's real and he has the endorsement of other Jewish politicians that aren't propagandized by a corrupt Israeli government. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=522.0s)]
*  Hakeem. But secondly, this was your moment, Hakeem, to also stand up against Islamophobia, because here's the thing about human rights. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=529.0s)]
*  You guys, you don't get to cherry pick if you're against anti-Semitism, then you have to be against Islamophobia, homophobia, racism and down the line. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=535.0s)]
*  Also class warfare. This war, this bigotry towards poor people is just abhorrent, which disproportionately helps people, hurts people with the color of Hawking Jeffries skin. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=543.0s)]
*  And so this kind of cherry picking because of who donates to Hawking Jeffries, APAC, APAC donates to Hawking Jeffries. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=551.0s)]
*  How on earth right now is the government of Israel helping calm and quell anti-Semitism? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=557.0s)]
*  How? How are they doing? They're not. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=564.0s)]
*  They lie and they propagandize and they say we get to do all this stuff with impunity. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=566.0s)]
*  And if you criticize us or you do anything wrong towards us or you speak out against us, then we're going to call you an anti-Semite. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=570.0s)]
*  The people who preach against against anti-Semitism should be joining Zoran Mondami and standing up against the Islamophobic attacks on him. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=576.0s)]
*  He has not said anything disparaging about Jewish people. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=583.0s)]
*  He stands with them in solidarity. And this type of crap is so disgusting to me. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=586.0s)]
*  And it is a cancer within the Democratic Party. And I'm just going to tell you guys something. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=590.0s)]
*  We lost these last two elections to an idiot because of these centrist policies and you're being beholden to special interest. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=594.0s)]
*  And by God, it's not going to happen again. You can either be a part of the problem or a part of the solution. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=601.0s)]
*  But if you want to try to box us in when we can clearly see with our eyes and clearly hear with our ears exactly what's happening with Israel and Gaza and try to propagandize another way, we're not dumb like MAGA. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=605.0s)]
*  We're not fucking stupid. Your base is smarter and you all are going to have to adapt or get the fuck out. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=617.0s)]
*  So Chuck Schumer doing a great job keeping the Democrats pro-Israel, huh? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=623.0s)]
*  The thing that is impressive is I mean, that last part where she was saying like, like, who is Hakeem Jeffries actually delivering this stuff to? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=627.0s)]
*  Like every New Yorker has seen Brad Lander walking around. He's the highest elected Jewish official in New York City. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=638.0s)]
*  Every New Yorker knows is anybody who's paid any attention to this election in the days before, whether it was on, you know, Colbert show or what? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=646.0s)]
*  Like, who is Hakeem Jeffries talking to? It's almost like they they don't realize they are in a small like black box theater. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=655.0s)]
*  That's the size of their audience now as to who they're even communicating to. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=666.0s)]
*  It's it's it's it is fascinating. They they like we need to reach we need to reach across the, you know, sort of the divide and they keep talking to a smaller and smaller group of people. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=671.0s)]
*  Yeah. One thing I always get really frustrated by because I think people on the left also have a tendency to do this where they're like, oh, well, like he has to address Israel because there's a lot of Jews in New York. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=684.0s)]
*  And they all care about Israel. And I feel like it's just like the dual loyalty trope. But like on a woke, I guess on the woke side, it's like the woke dual loyalty trope. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=699.0s)]
*  And my question always is like New York City is the largest Jewish city on the planet. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=708.0s)]
*  Sometimes Tel Aviv, I think, is has a higher number of Jewish people living in it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=714.0s)]
*  But I think New York City is either the number number one or number two largest Jewish city on the planet. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=719.0s)]
*  It predates the invention of the state of Israel. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=724.0s)]
*  Like Jewish people here have stronger roots to the United States of America and New York City in particular and Los Angeles as well than they do to Israel as an Asian state. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=729.0s)]
*  Israel is an ethno state. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=740.0s)]
*  Zionism is an ethno state project. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=743.0s)]
*  They incentivize American Jews and Jews all around the world to go and live in Israel. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=745.0s)]
*  So my question always is to these people that say like, oh, Jews really care about Israel. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=751.0s)]
*  It's all they care about. It's like, but these are American Jews. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=755.0s)]
*  These are New Yorkers. If they cared about Israel that much, they would live in Israel. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=758.0s)]
*  Yeah, like they would just go and live there. There are tremendous incentives to go and live there. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=763.0s)]
*  You actually get health care if you live in Israel. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=768.0s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it is a comprehensive health care coverage that they can afford because they don't have to actually spend a dime on their defense because we got that covered. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=770.0s)]
*  You get Palestinian land. Yeah, you get free housing if you want government subsidized housing in the West Bank if you want. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=778.0s)]
*  And yet so many Jewish people choose to live here and be American citizens and not be Israeli citizens in spite of all that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=784.0s)]
*  That to me is a clear indication that American Jews, just like American Muslims, just like American Christians have American problems. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=794.0s)]
*  And that's what they care about. They don't care about Israel to the degree in which people talk about it in the media. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=804.0s)]
*  Well, it's certainly I mean, look, I think there is based on my own experience, there is a learned attachment to Israel in relationship with Israel, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=810.0s)]
*  as opposed to say, like, I don't have the same relationship with Uganda. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=823.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe if the Zionist project had landed in Uganda, which at one point was banding around, but I don't. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=828.0s)]
*  And but that is different from saying this is the premier issue that they vote upon or they act upon or they move through life with. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=836.0s)]
*  It is also different from saying that Israel that these this relationship isn't complicated. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=848.0s)]
*  And I think it's different for people who have like direct relatives there, obviously in the same way that like, you know, I grew up in Worcester. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=855.0s)]
*  There was a lot of people like, you know, when you talk about the IRA or stuff like that, people are just like, F the British, you know, OK. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=865.0s)]
*  And I'm in Worcester. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=873.0s)]
*  They traffic guns. They directly traffic guns to the IRA. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=875.0s)]
*  Exactly. And and fundraise for the IRA in every bar. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=878.0s)]
*  There was a Republican congressperson. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=881.0s)]
*  100 percent. And and so this is, you know, there are different dynamics at different eras. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=883.0s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is that New York Jews didn't even for a moment as a whole, you know, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=890.0s)]
*  I was talking in generalities in terms of vast majority. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=899.0s)]
*  This was not an issue for them at all. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=902.0s)]
*  That's my point about the increasingly when Hakeem Jeffries gets out there and says that when Gillibrand says this, they are talking to a literally a roomful. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=905.0s)]
*  It's the same people, frankly, who Carvel was talking about. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=914.0s)]
*  I don't know if you caught that clip of Carvel. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=920.0s)]
*  Yeah, Carvel. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=923.0s)]
*  He says Carvel every time. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=925.0s)]
*  It's like an ice cream brand. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=927.0s)]
*  I have to pick and choose what I correct. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=928.0s)]
*  Exactly. He was on with and I can't remember the guy. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=930.0s)]
*  He was an old Al Hunt. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=934.0s)]
*  And he said, I go to these, you know, big Jewish donors of the Democratic Party. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=936.0s)]
*  They tell me they don't want to, you know, give money because of Israel or whatever it is. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=942.0s)]
*  It's really just the tax cuts. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=948.0s)]
*  And it is for a lot of these people. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=950.0s)]
*  It is a proxy that allows them to avoid talking about what the real issue is, class issues. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=954.0s)]
*  And they bring this up because it was a third rail, you know, type of deployment. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=963.0s)]
*  And it is no longer resonating. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=972.0s)]
*  It no longer resonates because of what people can see with their eyes in terms of the way that Israel has been, you know, engaged in this slaughter, genocide, ethnic cleansing. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=975.0s)]
*  I think all three probably appropriate. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=987.0s)]
*  But pick them. Pick whatever one you feel comfortable with saying. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=990.0s)]
*  And I think people are just like, I'm not going to, you know, make my determination. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=994.0s)]
*  It's going to be mayor of New York City or frankly, even the president of the United States at the end of the day. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1000.0s)]
*  I just don't think it's a detriment in the way that these guys suggest that it was for the longest time. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1006.0s)]
*  And they even did in the lead up to the election. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1011.0s)]
*  And that was, I guess, the reason why Kamala Harris could not actually chart a different trajectory for herself and like cut her off from the anchor that was the Joe Biden administration. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1014.0s)]
*  Even on this issue that was, again, you know, seventy five, twenty five percent at that point. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1026.0s)]
*  That's what's amazing is that that CNN clip from the other day they played over the course of eight years. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1031.0s)]
*  Yeah. The people on our campaign must have known that data. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1037.0s)]
*  Yeah. And we go. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1042.0s)]
*  This is absolute malfeasance by that campaign. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1045.0s)]
*  And it wasn't raised in that way. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1050.0s)]
*  They took it. They talked about it in the context of Mamdani. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1052.0s)]
*  But those numbers were not dramatically different six months ago or eight months ago or ten months ago. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1055.0s)]
*  Right. And yet the campaign just said, we're not even going to allow this Palestinian lawmaker to speak at the convention when it was completely benign. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1061.0s)]
*  Everything she had to say. Yeah. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1071.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it would have had reverberations beyond, I think, Israel, Palestine, because it would have shown everyone in America there would be so much like secondary coverage on. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1073.0s)]
*  Wow. Kamala Harris is actually separating herself from Joe Biden on this issue, which would have been a great marketing opportunity. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1085.0s)]
*  I literally advocated even for like from a bloodless, cold, cynical, calculated stance. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1091.0s)]
*  If you don't care about the humanity of like charred children that we are that we're facilitating the genocide of, the least you could do is like advocate on this because I don't want Donald Trump to win. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1097.0s)]
*  And this way you can like separate yourself from Joe Biden, who was deeply unpopular. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1108.0s)]
*  Everyone saw him as old, feeble and monstrous and simultaneously really win favors with a lot of people because I think that the issue of Israel and your opinion on Israel, I think, is a way for politicians to communicate [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1114.0s)]
*  Because it's such a because there's such a division between what the public feels about this versus what the media talks about or how the media talks about this issue and how politicians talk about this issue. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1129.0s)]
*  You can really cut away at that. And my fear always is that there are cynical actors, both on the media side, like Tucker Carlson or cynical actors on the on the political side, like Marjorie Taylor Green, that see that that know how to read the room better than everybody else. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1142.0s)]
*  And will utilize that to win favors with a broader audience. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1158.0s)]
*  And just to expand on that, it also indicates I am not a part of the establishment. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1162.0s)]
*  Yeah, it shows the responsiveness. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1168.0s)]
*  It shows the inclusion. It shows breaking with Biden. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1172.0s)]
*  But it is a proxy. The reason why, you know, Tucker Carlson or Marjorie Taylor Green find efficacy in it is it shows that they're anti establishment on some level. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1175.0s)]
*  Because, again, they are only speaking to the establishment. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1185.0s)]
*  Like Hakeem Jeffries is sitting on the on whatever meet the press saying Mamdani needs to deal with anti-Semitism. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1190.0s)]
*  No one thinks that. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1199.0s)]
*  Well, Marjorie Taylor Green may not be actually speaking to the Zionist donors that Carville was talking about there because she is actually an anti-Semite. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1201.0s)]
*  So she's not in the rooms that 95 percent of Republicans are in and like 70 percent of Democrats are in. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1210.0s)]
*  So when you ask like, who is this for? When Hakeem Jeffries is doing this performance, it's for the Zionist donor base. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1216.0s)]
*  And people can sense that. So when we're talking about it being like a proxy for other things, it is about showing Democratic responsiveness. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLgHCl-vbH8&t=1223.0s)]
