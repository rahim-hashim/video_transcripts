# NYU Withholds Diploma After Student Speaks Out Against “Genocide In Gaza”
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U)
*  There was an NYU student speaker at the NYU graduation who chose to speak about Palestine and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=0.0s)]
*  NYU is now withholding his diploma [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=8.84s)]
*  Let's just hear the speech see if you can find [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=12.88s)]
*  Any one-sided speech according to NYU which charges six figures to get a fucking degree from their university [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=16.84s)]
*  Can't determine what is what kind of issue should be one-sided maybe genocides I would suggest [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=24.2s)]
*  that this was a supposedly a one-sided speech according to that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=28.44s)]
*  prestigious University of higher education that I you know have to pay you serious money to myself [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=34.44s)]
*  So, you know, God bless the student [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=40.56s)]
*  So, please join me in welcoming to the podium the NYU Gallatin 2025 student speaker Logan roses [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  Greetings Gallatin's faculty and staff [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=59.44s)]
*  esteemed alumni speaker fellow graduates and loved ones [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  Trying to find my family in the crowd [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=67.2s)]
*  I've been freaking out a lot about this speech honestly, and as I [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=77.96s)]
*  Search my heart today in addressing you all my moral and political commitment [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=84.48s)]
*  Guide me to say that the only thing that is appropriate to say in this time and to a group this large [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=93.72s)]
*  is [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=102.28s)]
*  a recognition of the atrocities currently happening in Palestine [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=103.6s)]
*  I [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=114.36s)]
*  Want to say that the genocide currently occurring [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=133.6s)]
*  Is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=140.04s)]
*  Supported politically and militarily by the United States [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=142.48s)]
*  Is paid for by our tax dollars and has been live streamed to our phones for the past 18 months [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  And that I do not wish to speak only to my own politics today, but to speak for all people of conscience [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=152.64s)]
*  In all people who feel the moral injury of this atrocity [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=160.64s)]
*  And I want to say that I condemn this genocide and complicity in this genocide [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=170.2s)]
*  You put a prop clapping to the right there [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=186.72s)]
*  Let's see a little bit of approval from [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=192.32s)]
*  You [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=199.48s)]
*  Thank you to the class of 2025 Wow and congratulations [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  Pretty amazing [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  Those are the the the totality of the remarks you did hear some counter protests [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  Or counter, I guess [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=233.8s)]
*  Yeah booze and but it was overwhelmingly positive [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=236.68s)]
*  Sorry, yeah, no, some people were jeering but obviously that the applause was, you know [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=240.6s)]
*  resoundedly louder and drowning that out [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=246.28s)]
*  yeah, and we know that this like bears out when you look at views of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=249.72s)]
*  Israel and Palestine with young people [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=255.92s)]
*  If you're under the age of 30, you're very very likely [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=259.32s)]
*  To have a negative view of Israel right now [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=265.56s)]
*  this has been [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  Analyzing we've cited this poll now [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=272.32s)]
*  Probably a dozen times [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=275.28s)]
*  but I just still want to return to it from Pew research because [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=276.8s)]
*  There's not a ton of polling on this because of the McCarthy I nature and the cover-up [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=280.24s)]
*  But there's been a major shift in terms of negative views of Israel and it's been mostly [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=285.8s)]
*  Driven by people who are younger. I would also say Democrats. There's been [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=292.76s)]
*  Even a like gosh looking at this if you're a Democrat or lean Democrat you're above 50 in [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=299.64s)]
*  2022 43 percent had negative views of Israel now that's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=305.24s)]
*  66 percent if you're 18 to 49 71 percent of Dems early in Dems [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  You have negative views of Israel, but even if you're a Republican under the age of 50 half of all [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=314.04s)]
*  Republicans or lean Republicans under the age of 50 have a negative view of Israel [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=321.6s)]
*  So this is not about protecting students. They took that kid's diploma away [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=326.44s)]
*  They're trying to kill the spirit and courage of the students who came there to learn and he learned [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  He learned it's no this is the second year in a row. This has happened [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=337.8s)]
*  It's no it's no accident that the people that rise to the top of the classes are the ones that are going to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  This is a meritocracy, right? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=347.16s)]
*  And the roar of those students is is so exceptional to view here [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  And I think G here has made this point [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=355.88000000000005s)]
*  I think G here has made this point [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=357.88s)]
*  Right now and this is at places like NYU. This is at 60 minutes. This is in the Democratic Party [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=360.28s)]
*  Support for Israel is being maintained by an iron iron grip by those who are in power [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=367.56s)]
*  It is the the the popular base for this is gone [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=373.08s)]
*  It should have I mean [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=376.76s)]
*  Not a moment too soon [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=379.08s)]
*  Um, but yes, this has to be imposed [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=380.92s)]
*  Using draconian methods, which is like a student one of the best exemplars that university [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=383.64s)]
*  Produced over the course of like a certain amount of years [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=390.35999999999996s)]
*  Now you have to withhold their diploma and say they were one-sided [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  Shame on you for not being quote one-sided on what we are seeing right now [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=399.32s)]
*  It is disgusting and it is again it is because they're zionists making decisions on the for these university boards [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  It's like the same thing with columbia. It's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=410.68s)]
*  At the very top and people need more courage like the ben and jerry's guy or this student here to call that out [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=413.48s)]
*  And break this levy wide open and we saw this condemnation with donald trump [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=420.52s)]
*  In his first term when he said there were good people on both sides of the charlottesville [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=426.04s)]
*  neo-nazi [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=432.58s)]
*  Demonstration it's not the exact same but it should be the same [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=433.78000000000003s)]
*  Construction there is no comparison between the sides of one side committing genocide [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=438.28s)]
*  And the other side being a victim of it and it's offensive to suggest otherwise [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=445.08s)]
*  Let alone to take punitive action against a student to suppress his righteous speech to stand up for the people [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=449.8s)]
*  Who are currently being exterminated with our tax dollars? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  I think it's telling that [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=461.24s)]
*  The student was able to actually [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=463.56s)]
*  Finish the speech without being taken off stage without his mic being cut because I think it's clear [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  Um, as I think matt like alluded to like everyone there even the teachers or students or [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=473.4s)]
*  Obviously the students but anyone with any power there [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=480.36s)]
*  Uh did not have any reaction to it because they were just gonna let it go [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=483.96s)]
*  This was a decision made from the top down by people probably not even in the room [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=488.28s)]
*  Administrators right from some board from some administrators [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=493.0s)]
*  that [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=497.88s)]
*  They found out about it afterwards and needed to dole out a punishment [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=499.0s)]
*  specifically really to tell [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=504.42s)]
*  The students who are still at at yu that this is what's hat [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=507.0s)]
*  What will happen to you next year or in two years or whenever you graduate if you dare to try the same thing? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=510.6s)]
*  Absolutely, and I think just to add to that and what everyone else has already said [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=518.1s)]
*  What's really frustrating for me is that? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=521.88s)]
*  Things like this will absolutely delegitimize these institutions [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=524.6800000000001s)]
*  Not just the colleges who are taking away people's diplomas for speaking out against the genocide or calling into police to crack their skulls [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=528.52s)]
*  But the mainstream media outlets that are running interference for israeli genocide [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=534.76s)]
*  Although that's been even ebbing a little bit as it's become harder and harder to deny but overwhelmingly still running interference [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=538.9200000000001s)]
*  They're delegitimizing themselves and then as they make themselves weaker as they make themselves seem less [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=545.88s)]
*  Important to protect despite the fact that they are occupying these incredibly important positions like they're filling these roles like free press [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=551.48s)]
*  You know educate higher education or society and they are weakening themselves at a time where fascism is on the rise [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=558.9200000000001s)]
*  And they will try to abdicate responsibility for why people have no faith in these institutions [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=565.32s)]
*  They will try to pretend it's entirely because the right wing is waging campaigns against them. They will try to use any other [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=571.32s)]
*  Mechanism for explaining why people do not trust them anymore besides their own actions [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=577.56s)]
*  Which will inevitably make it harder for people to defend them from like the rising fascist tide in this country [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=582.68s)]
*  And I just want to say also to any students who happen to be watching this [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=588.84s)]
*  That diploma at the end there is just a just a piece of paper [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=592.52s)]
*  I can say this as someone and i'm sure everyone else here [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=595.64s)]
*  I mean they're they're using that making you think like your future is ruined. You're not getting your diploma you you graduated [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=598.12s)]
*  You you completed the courses you're done [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=604.28s)]
*  Don't let them [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=607.08s)]
*  Wave a piece of paper in front of you to silence you [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=608.6s)]
*  Yeah, you know this reminds me of when sam had the whole roman polanski. Um affair and he made the point like [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=611.96s)]
*  If msnbc as a news organization [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=619.0s)]
*  Cannot determine basic things like what was the intent behind that message which was to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=621.64s)]
*  Actually satirize as unacceptable to people who wanted to you know be apologetic for roman polanski, then they should wrap it up [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=628.12s)]
*  And this whole anti-semitism anti-zionism is that in way larger scale with way higher stakes [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=635.96s)]
*  And every one of these institutions absolutely fails it because they're corrupted by people at the top who want that conflation to be continued [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=642.44s)]
*  And it is disgusting that these institutions can charge [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=649.88s)]
*  The best and brightest so much money to supposedly be intellectually curious and get humanity's education [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=654.6s)]
*  And they are adhering to a lie that is designed to protect a genocidal state right now [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=662.4399999999999s)]

*  try to find an article in the english language right now about how there's been dozens of [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=680.5999999999999s)]

*  just bombing the hell out of gaza for the past two days and retaliation for trump going around them to [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=691.8s)]
*  Dare to get the u.s. Hostage out, which is what biden should have done [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=697.64s)]
*  Um here it is in the statement from nyu nyu strongly denounces the choice by a student at the gallatin school's graduation today [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=701.4s)]
*  What's gallatin? It's one of the schools matt right here. Yeah [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=709.4799999999999s)]
*  One of our 20 school graduation ceremonies across our campus to misuse his role as a student speaker to express his personal and one [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=714.04s)]
*  Decided political views he lied about the speech [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=721.8s)]
*  He was going to deliver and violated the commitment he made to comply with our rules [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=724.52s)]
*  The university was we wanted no anti israel things [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=729.3199999999999s)]
*  Yes, the university is withholding his diploma while we pursue disciplinary action. So disgusting binder [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=733.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure if that's the case [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=739.64s)]
*  Like i'm not sure if they mean they're literally withholding his ability to graduate because they say they follow it up with disciplinary action [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=742.28s)]
*  I mean, it's been a while since I graduated but when I graduated we did all the all the paperwork everything was done [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=749.4s)]
*  And that that diploma was just a piece of paper [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=756.12s)]
*  They said they made it clear and in fact, we didn't even get our real diploma at the thing [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=759.4s)]
*  Uh, they didn't even have them ready. So but but then what would a disciplinary action? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=764.04s)]
*  Entail if he's no longer a student anymore. So that's my fear [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=769.0799999999999s)]
*  This could just be a statement that's put out there to uh, I mean [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=774.28s)]
*  I'm pretty sure if you want to go the whole way you paid for the damn school [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=776.68s)]
*  You completed the courses you could sue them and probably graduate. I mean, you'll probably can you like this is the problem [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=780.04s)]
*  There's zionists like like there's a there's a mass mccarthyite cover-up right now [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=786.52s)]
*  Zionist mccarthyism of the 21st century. I don't know that that's a that that is true fully because i'm i'm concerned about this kid [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=792.4399999999999s)]
*  But that's all i'm saying I and I think regards to the mechanism we can be honest that they're trying to bully him [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=799.2399999999999s)]
*  At least they're trying to make an example of this kid so that other people do not follow suit [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=803.7199999999999s)]
*  And that action in and of itself is you know, it's immoral [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=808.5999999999999s)]
*  It kind of reveals that despite what's on the ten of all of these liberal college institutions [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=812.4399999999999s)]
*  It's a very authoritarian strain of you know, essentially just operating as a business that has shareholders in the form of donors [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=817.8s)]
*  Or shareholders in the form of board members who are always going to take precedent over whatever [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=825.64s)]
*  Ostensible dedication to like the process of learning they they put on the crest in latin in three words [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=831.4s)]
*  And I think as kids are becoming more cynical about higher education things like this do not help [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=838.84s)]
*  Because like it proves beyond a shadow of doubt that it's not about what you learn [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=845.5600000000001s)]
*  It's about how you comport to the very specific set of rules political [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=849.16s)]
*  Funding of the of the institution and everything else is secondary to that [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=855.0s)]
*  Like that's kind of what I mean about they are devaluing themselves and they're going to try to make it everyone else's [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=858.8399999999999s)]
*  Responsibility for that in the future anyone who cares about these things are going to be made to run interference for them [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=863.9399999999999s)]
*  If trump ever decides to attack higher education even more [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=869.16s)]
*  Well, I mean elita universities are using [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=873.0s)]
*  Consistent it's part of their modus operandi [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=876.76s)]
*  They use money as a disciplinary tool for its student base like and i'm not blaming the universities fully for the student [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=879.7199999999999s)]
*  debt that [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=887.88s)]
*  People are saddled with but it's a similar dynamic where it's like they ain't fighting it. Yeah [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=889.1600000000001s)]
*  Think about these think about it for a second [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=895.32s)]
*  If you go through [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=898.0400000000001s)]
*  Nyu is one like my cousin went there and like the amount of student debt that [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=899.8000000000001s)]
*  She had coming out of that school because it was so expensive, but it was her dream to go there [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=904.12s)]
*  She wanted to be in school in new york city [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=908.0400000000001s)]
*  um [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=910.12s)]
*  That's like a dream that a lot of kids have I think right? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=911.1600000000001s)]
*  They have they they implement that level of debt so you go into some sort of career [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=914.44s)]
*  Where you'll make more money? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=920.76s)]
*  You can pay that off more quickly and you're not going to do something like be a not work for a non-profit [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=923.4s)]
*  Or be a journalist or something like that. It's much more difficult [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=928.12s)]
*  They're also using the expensiveness of nyu and other elite institutions are doing the same [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=931.88s)]
*  To say like is this really what you want to risk for your little speech against genocide? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=937.1600000000001s)]
*  Because we could pull this back [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=941.48s)]
*  like [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=943.32s)]
*  This is what but then but then but then but then but date from jamaica says that you could block his transcript access [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=944.12s)]
*  Just another guy the diploma is ceremonial [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=949.08s)]
*  But your actual degree is what your official college transcripts because and the school absolutely has control over that [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=951.0s)]
*  So that's just my one concern [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=955.8s)]
*  But yeah, I mean unless unless you're unless you're going into like a field like the medical field or something like that [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=957.08s)]
*  Where there's a secondary school I this is my personal experience again very anecdotal [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=962.04s)]
*  But no job has ever checked my transcript. They see that I say I graduate and that's that [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=966.6800000000001s)]
*  But at the same time though these these schools though if they go down this road [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=973.72s)]
*  then they're going down a very slippery slope for themselves because [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=978.2s)]
*  degrees [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=983.32s)]
*  Unless like there was an like some sort of cheating scandal or plagiarism once you earn the degree [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=984.84s)]
*  That's it. They don't revoke the degree [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=991.4s)]
*  If they start doing that [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=993.96s)]
*  Because of a student's opinion or actions in something like this which has nothing to do with their records [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=995.8s)]
*  Then why would anyone pay money? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1001.96s)]
*  For just all that money just for a school to four years down any school four years down the line to say [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1004.84s)]
*  You know what? We don't like your opinion. We don't like what you said degree revoked people would just stop going [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1010.6800000000001s)]
*  What's the whole point? So these schools want to do that. They're going down a very slippery slope of people [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1015.6400000000001s)]
*  Dolling out their money to get this degree that can just be plucked from them because they have they have the wrong opinion on something [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1021.72s)]
*  Down the line. That's the key point is people should be under no illusions what they're doing when they and I say this is [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1028.12s)]
*  Somebody who graduated not um, not gallatin, which is the like school for individualized study. So that's kind of funny that um, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1033.56s)]
*  This kid gets kicked out. I went to steinheart [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1040.6s)]
*  But people should be under no illusions what they are getting when they go to these schools and the only value [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1042.36s)]
*  That you know why I don't regret going to nyu myself despite, you know, how much it costs every fuck a month is [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1048.36s)]
*  The roar of those students and you get put amongst people like that, but in terms of like [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1054.28s)]
*  The this gallatin and gallatin was like thomas jefferson's like secretary of commerce or whatever. That's how far back [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1060.52s)]
*  This institution goes and they're like bender said lighting its reputation on fire for a colonial state that is doing a genocide right now [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1067.08s)]
*  Piss it away [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1076.68s)]
*  250 years, whatever the fuck who cares? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1078.18s)]
*  Netnyahu needs more bombs to drop on tents and yeah people should not go here under [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1080.52s)]
*  I don't think they should go there frankly as someone who went to nyu [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1085.6399999999999s)]
*  I think if you're making this decision as a high school student right now [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1088.28s)]
*  Go to a state school do not go to columbia not go to nyu. Don't go to any of these way too expensive [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1091.4799999999998s)]
*  Universities because I mean bender do you remember this put this up russ. This is a tweet you had [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1097.4799999999998s)]
*  early in the genocide here [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1102.84s)]
*  tablet magazines [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1105.3999999999999s)]
*  A lead story written by its editor at large is entirely based on the debunked palliwood conspiracy theories surrounding palestinian instagram influencer gaza [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1106.76s)]
*  You remember this bender? I do. Yep [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1113.16s)]
*  The guy who wrote that that tablet magazine editor at large was a guy named lial leibovitz [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1116.52s)]
*  IDF vet spokesperson who was the nyu professor who invited tim pool to lecture one of my classes which cost like [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1121.16s)]
*  450 dollars per session [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1128.5s)]
*  um, and tim pool basically came and talked about how he had like external battery accessories that [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1129.96s)]
*  At occupy and that's why he's a good journalist remember you should not go to these institutions [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1135.0s)]
*  For the institution prestige or for the content you should go there if you want and you can afford it [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1141.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean I could afford I still don't mind going there because of the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1146.76s)]
*  Associations you get again with the type of people who roar when they hear somebody get on stage and say what they are thinking [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1150.26s)]
*  Which is that our university is complicit in this shit and it goes even far beyond israel into participation with gulf state monarchies [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1156.3600000000001s)]
*  And you know different types of campuses [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1164.2s)]
*  There is a moral rot [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1167.72s)]
*  At the top of all of these organizations and it's driven by finance and money [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1170.12s)]
*  but the inability to realize like what is righteous and what is one-sided and [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1174.84s)]
*  what your obligations are as an institution that [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1181.3999999999999s)]
*  Again, like the the class that that guy taught that genocide denial lial leibovitz doing the palliwood conspiracy theory [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1184.84s)]
*  He taught me digital media activism [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1192.1200000000001s)]
*  Of non-violent protest I got taught that by an idf guy at nyu [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1196.5200000000002s)]
*  And that's the understanding that's that sort of meta understanding that nyu would force feed me something from a despicable person like that [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH0qsgJ_e6U&t=1201.72s)]
