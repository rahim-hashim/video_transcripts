# Mohsen Mahdawi Freed | Shezza Abboushi Dallal | TMR
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs)
*  We are back and we are joined now by Shaza Abushi Dalal, staff attorney with the Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility Project, CLEAR. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=0.0s)]
*  She is one of the lawyers for Mohsen Madawi, the Palestinian Columbia student and activist who was just released on bail yesterday from immigration detention. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=8.88s)]
*  And you are also on Mahmoud Khalil's legal defense team. So thank you so much for coming on the show today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=16.64s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=22.56s)]
*  So this is really good news. This broke yesterday. Mohsen is finally home. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=24.24s)]
*  Can you take us through the case and what led to eventually yesterday, the judge releasing him on bail? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=29.92s)]
*  Absolutely. So Mohsen Madawi is a Palestinian man. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=39.08s)]
*  He grew up in a refugee camp in the West Bank, Palestine, and he came to the United States 10 years ago. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=43.92s)]
*  His home for the majority of the past decade has been Vermont. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=52.28s)]
*  He also is an undergraduate student at Columbia University and is actually slated to graduate in just a few weeks this month. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=58.12s)]
*  And before continuing on to a master's program at Columbia, which he now will be able to do because he'll be able to graduate because he's been released. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=67.44s)]
*  And so he has been very active lending his voice to calls around the country to end the genocide in Gaza and for the rights and lives of Palestinians. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=77.24s)]
*  And has been active in doing that on Columbia University's campus, where he's an undergraduate student. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  And as a result of that activism, he became the victim of a really brutal doxxing campaign that escalated over the course of the past few months. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=100.55999999999999s)]
*  And so alongside Mahmoud Khalil and many other people had doxxing organizations like Bittar USA and Canary Mission calling for his deportation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=114.56s)]
*  And harassing him and sending threats online and calling for others to do the same. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=129.52s)]
*  And so he knew that he was under threat from actors like that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=139.52s)]
*  And when he saw that other advocates for Palestinian lives like Mahmoud Khalil and then Ramesa Ozturk and Mbeder Kansouri were being abducted in broad daylight. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=146.88s)]
*  Or from the entrances of their homes in early March, he was on alert about the potential danger that he might be targeted also for his First Amendment protected activity. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=159.28s)]
*  And then in March, he received a notice. So the other thing to know is that Mohsen is a legal permanent resident. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=173.2s)]
*  And he has been a legal permanent resident for many years and he is at the final stage of the process to become a citizen. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  And so in late March, he received an interview notice scheduling him for a naturalization interview at a USCIS office in Burlington, Vermont. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=189.84s)]
*  And he went to that interview and in the final moments of the interview after he had completed it, he was abducted by Department of Homeland Security. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=199.68s)]
*  And they attempted to whisk him away to Louisiana and their plan to take him away from his community and from his home was thwarted. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=210.08s)]
*  Because his legal counsel filed a habeas petition in federal court in Vermont before they had the opportunity to remove him. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  And they were not able to put him on the flight to Vermont. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=231.52s)]
*  And so he has been in Vermont ICE detention since. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=235.2s)]
*  And so yesterday it would have been, I believe, 10 days of detention. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=240.64s)]
*  And yesterday, the district of Vermont, a federal court heard him on his motion to be released on bail throughout the pendency of his federal court litigation. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=247.44s)]
*  And he won. He was released. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=258.96s)]
*  And the judge did this in acknowledgement of the fact that if he were to be kept in detention, in retaliation for what is very clearly just his speech and First Amendment protected activity throughout the pendency of his litigation challenging that retaliation, well, then the harm will have been done. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=261.92s)]
*  And released him in an effort to restore people around the country's faith in First Amendment rights. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  And also in order to allow Mohsen to be out practicing his right to free speech, advocating for Palestinian lives, finishing his studies, which he has worked so hard towards. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  And so it's a huge victory for Mohsen. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=311.6s)]
*  It's a victory for the principles that are being litigated in this federal court and a number of other federal courts around the country right now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=313.68s)]
*  Does Mohsen have an inkling or a feeling that that immigration appointment might have been in a way for the federal government to lure him to a place where they could potentially arrest him? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=322.08s)]
*  Or is that still kind of just being litigated in court? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=337.12s)]
*  Did he have an inkling when he went to his naturalization? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=341.92s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=346.24s)]
*  Of course, he was scared about the possibility, you know, because he received the notice in late March. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=348.24s)]
*  He was seeing his peers being targeted by the Trump administration for exactly the type of speech for Palestinian lives that he had engaged in. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=353.76s)]
*  He was seeing calls by, again, doxing organizations like Bittar USA for his deportation, even making allegations around, you know, claims that the Trump administration had represented to them that he was next and they'd secured his targeting. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=362.0s)]
*  And so I think he was fearful about that, but also hopeful that, you know, he had, as far as he's concerned, he's been a legal permanent resident for many years. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=381.04s)]
*  This is the last stage of the process. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=390.32s)]
*  He's committed to becoming a United States citizen and went to the appointment. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=391.92s)]
*  I think it's also important to note, you know, he had spent weeks living in fear. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=398.48s)]
*  And I think it's a testament to exactly the power of the unconstitutional targeting that we're seeing from the Trump administration right now. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=405.84s)]
*  The ability to make people around the country fearful that they too are going to be abducted if they show up to an immigration interview, if they write an op-ed, if they deliver a speech, if they post any sort of social media post that, you know, advocates for the dignity and lives and freedom of people in Palestine or elsewhere. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=416.08s)]
*  If it doesn't comport perfectly with the Trump administration's perspectives and top line policies. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=438.48s)]
*  And this was spoken about a bit by the judge, is my understanding. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=447.44s)]
*  The judge had very strong language, Crawford, to the actions by the Trump administration and the acting U.S. attorney in Vermont, who was arguing on the Trump administration's behalf. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=454.64s)]
*  Can you speak a little bit about what the judge said and some of the historical examples that were drawn upon in the judge's ruling? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=468.88s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for that question. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=479.2s)]
*  He really did have very powerful things to say about what was at stake in this case and the historical backdrop. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=480.64s)]
*  I mean, he said very plainly, this is not the first time that we've seen the U.S. government try and wage detention and deportations in order to chill or completely shut down debate that we've been here before. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, he evoked the Red Scare, the Palmer raids of 1919 and 1920, the McCarthy era, and essentially situated this as a resurgence of that type of repression. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=506.0s)]
*  He evoked a number of courts who in that time used habeas jurisdiction, used their power as federal courts to prevent that type of targeting of people and retaliation for their political speech and First Amendment protected activity. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  And situated his decision upon that backdrop. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  And I think he's right to do that. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=547.92s)]
*  That is what we're witnessing now. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=551.28s)]
*  And the decision to release Mohsen yesterday was a victory for Mohsen, but also does a huge deal to restore faith that we're not going to see people languish in detention centers far from their homes and their communities because they dare dissent or dare take a line that is different from the Trump administration's position or other. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=552.88s)]
*  Or any other administration that there will be checks and balances and courts will intervene to prevent that type of punishment. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=577.28s)]
*  We only have you for a limited time. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  So I have really two questions here and one is just about the future of his case because he's out on bail and prosecution. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=588.88s)]
*  We could be seeing that in the future. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=598.56s)]
*  What is your sense of how the how what the path forward is for Mohsen? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=601.52s)]
*  I mean, he has not at all at one point been charged with any kind of crime, right? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=609.92s)]
*  That's not what we're dealing with here. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=617.44s)]
*  And so he's out on bail now and he he still is in federal court asking for the court to vindicate his constitutional rights. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=619.52s)]
*  And that battle continues and will continue to completion. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=628.72s)]
*  And I just want to say the absurdity of being out on bail without a without a charge. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=633.52s)]
*  I mean, this is this is unbelievable. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  It absolutely is unbelievable and underlies so much of what is unjust about what is happening to him and not just him, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=641.6s)]
*  but Mahmoud Khalil, Rumeysa Ozturk, Abadur Kansuri, Lekha Kordia. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=650.8s)]
*  She's not in detention, but Yunso Chung. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=657.84s)]
*  All of these cases in which we're seeing retaliation for political dissent, political speech, participating in protests. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=661.6s)]
*  So he is seeking to have his constitutional rights vindicated and to challenge this retaliatory practice. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  That case continues in federal court. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=679.6s)]
*  And that's what we have to look forward to and what we'll be battling ahead in court. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=683.84s)]
*  And lastly, this this the arguments that you made to help free Mohsen, can can those be applied to other cases? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  I mentioned that you also represent Mahmoud Khalil, who remains in ICE custody in Louisiana. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=698.48s)]
*  Do you feel that this gives you and your legal team a road map here to work with trying to free some of the people you named, just including Mahmoud? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the three through line between all of these cases is these are people who, like Mohsen, are being targeted. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=717.12s)]
*  And the administration is making no secret of this are being targeted for their speech and for their organizing. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=724.9599999999999s)]
*  And many of the people that I listed just a few moments ago also have motions requesting their release on bail in front of the federal courts that they are in. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=732.0s)]
*  And and are waiting for those motions to be decided on and even heard. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=744.48s)]
*  And, you know, because they are sitting in detention as part of a plan to punish for their First Amendment protected speech, they too should be released. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=751.2s)]
*  And the crux of it is that in their case and writ large when it comes to people's faith in the First Amendment and the protections that it extends, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=764.64s)]
*  the damage will be done if they continue to language and language and detention while their cases are heard. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  Shaza Abushidallah, thank you so much for your time today. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=786.8000000000001s)]
*  Really appreciate it. And thanks for coming on and all for all your work helping free these people who are being persecuted for protesting genocide. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=791.52s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=799.52s)]
*  Thank you for having me. And we hope to see them all free. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzAQDBw-qIs&t=804.0s)]
