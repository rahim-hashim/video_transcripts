# Hasan Piker's INSPIRING Cambridge University Speech
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs)
*  Should we play this clip of Hassan? Because it's a little inspirational one. Sure. We should make [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=0.0s)]
*  it a little bit and then we'll put it on Russell Brand. We may have to replay the Hassan clip [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  after that. Hassan went to Cambridge, not the one in Massachusetts, but the one over on the other [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=12.72s)]
*  side of the pond, as it were. And he quoted Michael Brooks, too. Maybe we should play both [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=24.0s)]
*  these clips. Hassan is there. I love that he did the professor look, too. I mean, he knew what to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=35.44s)]
*  wear for this kind of event. Like, he's nearing a tweed jacket there. It's not quite tweed, but, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=44.16s)]
*  you know, very professorial, Hassan. It is amazing that they have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=51.68s)]
*  sport coats like that, that you can actually get around. The guy's massive. He's so big. Yeah, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=58.32s)]
*  he's tall. His arms! I can't believe it's loose around the arms. Go. Why don't you come down over [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=63.04s)]
*  there? And I stand before you following the footsteps of intellectual giants as nothing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=68.88s)]
*  but a simple man. A simple man who understands right from wrong. And sometimes that's all that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=77.36s)]
*  matters. In the words of my friend, the late great Michael Jamal Brooks, there's nothing complicated [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=82.24s)]
*  about apartheid. The morality of it is clear. If the roles were reversed and a captive Jewish [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=87.6s)]
*  population of five million people were being systematically starved, sieged, and dominated, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=92.32s)]
*  everyone would understand what's going on. It's ancestral lands being destroyed. Everyone would [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=98.16s)]
*  understand what's going on. So in his words, it's not a complex issue. It's super simple. It's the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=102.64s)]
*  most powerful country in the Middle East. It's backed by the United States, the most powerful [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=107.52s)]
*  country on the planet. And it acts on another population of people with total impunity and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  has never held accountable for anything. Well, I guess some things are changing in that regard, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=117.28s)]
*  and we'll get to that in a little bit. But there is no symmetry in this relationship, period. That's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=121.04s)]
*  what Michael Jamal Brooks said. So I see no need for obfuscation, no arguments for complexity, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=125.92s)]
*  no reasoning for preemptive genocide. Israel is an apartheid state, and its inception was a [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=131.92s)]
*  violent one with the forced displacement of 700,000, which gave birth to a settler colonial [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=138.0s)]
*  entity that continues to dominate the lives of more than five million Palestinians under its [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  illegal occupation, totaling 15 million Palestinians around the globe that are [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=149.27999999999997s)]
*  permanently displaced. Its demographic concerns is- [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=154.16s)]
*  Good for him, citing Brooks. Michael would have liked that. Many people have watched that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=159.04s)]
*  clip of Michael Brooks saying that. And Hassan went on to, basically, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=166.16s)]
*  to, with a message of hope, as it were, it is completely understandable that people are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=176.96s)]
*  feeling a little bit exhausted already and demoralized. But there's plenty of examples [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=189.84s)]
*  in just the US history alone of times that were even more despairing than we should now. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  And in many ways, we have more mechanisms for people to influence outcomes of things like [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=210.72s)]
*  happen with our government. And so here's Hassan wrapping up at Cambridge. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=220.64s)]
*  I hate Elon Musk as much as you guys hate Oxford College. I heard that if I say that, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  I'll get some applause breaks there. So that was my exit ramp. But it's not just Elon Musk, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=251.04s)]
*  it's not just Twitter. It's happening all around. Young people, men in particular, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=256.96s)]
*  who don't have much education or literacy skills with no hopeful prospects of the future, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=260.8s)]
*  are being propagandized by waves of right-wing influencers who have never had megaphones this [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=265.44s)]
*  loud. Although this issue most often gets brought up in the context of the 2024 election in Donald [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=271.36s)]
*  Trump, there's more to this. I think it's important to connect it to Palestine as well. These are [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=276.32s)]
*  forces who want to normalize the current levels of violence and to convince people that actually [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  it's good to be this bloodthirsty. While it was Joe Biden who gave Israel the blank check [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=288.0s)]
*  with which to commit a genocide, that decision has created an entire galaxy of right-wingers [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=293.2s)]
*  who are actually in position to cash it. And cash it they are currently. If you've seen the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=299.04s)]
*  Donald Trump cabinet picks, you know exactly what I'm talking about. The traditional forces that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=304.0s)]
*  can keep this kind of thing in check, particularly in politics and in media, are unfortunately weak [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=308.08s)]
*  and they're getting weaker by the moment. They're out of power. They're broke. They're [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=313.44s)]
*  technologically weak. They don't understand the space. They don't understand the online [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=316.96s)]
*  content creation sphere. And I feel like they've most importantly, with their coverage of Gaza, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=321.52s)]
*  discredited themselves to an entire generation. It seems right now that those people who genuinely [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=328.64s)]
*  desire for a better future, who want an alternative to the genocide, will have to start looking [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=334.8s)]
*  amongst themselves, looking within themselves, their friends, and away from the mainstream. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=341.04s)]
*  If they want to help bring something like justice into the world. So I stand before you [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=346.08s)]
*  as a man who simply wants some semblance of justice for the Palestinians. I urge you not [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=350.64s)]
*  to lean into nihilism and succumb to helplessness because you do not need the academic pedigree to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=356.08s)]
*  know right from wrong. All you need is your moral compass. As someone who has seen the Palestine [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  question evolve over my past 10 years of public advocacy, I never would have imagined international [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=367.68s)]
*  organs demand legal restitution from America's most valuable asset. After all, there are decades [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=373.6s)]
*  where nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen. Thank you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  Good for him. That's great. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  That's great. Hassan is getting more coverage, more attention, him being on Pod Save, him going [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=392.56s)]
*  on with CNN and pissing off Bakari sellers. I didn't even watch that. I was like, this will put my [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=400.48s)]
*  blood pressure way too high. But I did see, of course, he's jumping on criticizing any kind of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=408.40000000000003s)]
*  systemic critique of the Democratic Party, which seems like 80% of cable news hosts are on that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  track. He should be getting even more attention because he's doing great work. Great job, Hassan. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=420.72s)]
*  Yep. The biggest, I mean, like the biggest left streamer, YouTuber, or whatever you want to call it [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=428.0s)]
*  in the world. Definitely in like US politics. Good stuff. But we may have a little bit to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=441.6s)]
*  doubt for that too. What'd you say? You may have a little antidote for that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=455.44s)]
*  What's this? Yeah, here we go. It's too bad. Matt's not here. Matt was raised, did you know, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=461.84s)]
*  by Russell Brand? Look, like Matt, I was a big fan of Russell Brand. I read two of his books. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=469.12s)]
*  I saw his stand up in Atlantic City with my mom. My mom, like he had a pictures of Jesus and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=476.64s)]
*  Che Guevara on the stage and made some like risky jokes about Christianity to the point where [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=485.6s)]
*  like people in Atlantic City who I don't think knew what they were getting into [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=494.16s)]
*  when they went to his show, they were just there to gamble, walked out and like were heckling him [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=499.04s)]
*  and they were, you know, older white people upset with how he was talking about Christians [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=503.92s)]
*  and Jesus Christ because he was subversive at that time. Guess not now, huh? Well, you know, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=509.04s)]
*  listen, a lot of times you may run into a situation where you have been accused of, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=517.28s)]
*  of like, what was he accused of? Oh, sexual assault. Yeah. And that cuts into, you know, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=525.6s)]
*  what you may be doing. And so a lot of times what people do is they'll run to get some type of [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=535.52s)]
*  redemption and find a, you know, new audience simultaneously. And thus I give you Russell Brand. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=541.76s)]
*  I've paid, I've paid for sex before. I've slept with, I've, I will not say I've slept with [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=551.12s)]
*  prostitutes because I would not denigrate those women with that time. I prostituted them. I [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=558.24s)]
*  participated in sin. I objectified them. So keen to worship at false orders that I allowed myself [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=565.04s)]
*  and other people to be denigrated. I desecrated his code. Oh, the one word that hit me so hard [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=574.96s)]
*  in Corinthians when Paul says to them, did you not know that your body is a temple? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=583.6s)]
*  That your body is a temple. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=594.48s)]
*  It's the, did you not know that gets me? Did you not know that your body is a temple? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=599.44s)]
*  Did no one tell you that it's sacred, that you are beautiful? You can't have known otherwise you [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=607.12s)]
*  wouldn't live like that. You can't have known that you are loved, so loved that he would do that for [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=616.08s)]
*  you. He did that for us. Let's not carry on doing the stuff that you got nailed up there for. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=622.96s)]
*  Did you not know that your body is a temple? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=633.12s)]
*  I mean look, Russell Brand is bouncing around looking for a, a, you know, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=639.36s)]
*  in some ways he had sort of like a certain self-righteousness before and it, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=653.44s)]
*  now it's just a righteousness that he found in a different place that is going to be helpful. I, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=657.84s)]
*  um, I don't know, people are saying like, he's acting and I don't know. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=662.64s)]
*  It's not that, it's not that simple. You know, you can, people can convince themselves of things [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=670.8000000000001s)]
*  when it's necessary. He, the, like the idea that he's just saying that, oh, I prostituted them and I [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=677.0400000000001s)]
*  need to redeem myself. In 2006, when he was 30 years old, a now woman claims that he assaulted [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=685.84s)]
*  her when she was 16 years old and still in school. Well, let's talk about more about when I did the [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=692.64s)]
*  prostitution. There were other allegations by a girlfriend off at the time. In 2012, a woman alleged [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=698.1600000000001s)]
*  that Brand raped her against a wall at his Los Angeles home in July 2012 after she refused to [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=705.76s)]
*  join him in sexual activity with a friend. She told the Sunday Times that she went to a rape [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=711.68s)]
*  treatment center the same day and had therapy for five months and the records that were given to the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=716.88s)]
*  Sunday Times show that she did contemplate civil or criminal proceedings but decided against it at [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=722.08s)]
*  the time. Tim Poole would say that if she had gotten pregnant from that rape that, that she had [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=728.56s)]
*  failed her duties to society and needed that baby as a, to be born. Well, I did say I've objectified [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=732.88s)]
*  women. I know. Right. I'm pertained. So let's not get into the details of the whole thing. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=740.56s)]
*  I mean, there's more. There's more than the ones I just listed. But did you not know? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=748.64s)]
*  I mean, apparently, you knew, like, and someone, people reported me. Right. But [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=753.76s)]
*  let's just pretend no one knew. And now I get to get out of jail free called [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=760.3199999999999s)]
*  because I felt like jail, Jay, Jesus, Jay, Jesus, both, both. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=768.48s)]
*  His body is a temple, but apparently not the women who he allegedly violated. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=780.56s)]
*  Okay. Now I said I objectified them. I objectified them. So I'm okay now. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=785.2s)]
*  I feel pretty comfortable in saying he's a delusional narcissist. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHuMhCVmFs&t=795.28s)]
