# Trump: "I Don't Care" If US Spies Say Iran's Not Building Nukes
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc)
*  Donald Trump left the g7. He said it wasn't to deal with the peace. It was bigger than that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=0.0s)]
*  people all over the internet with images of mobilization of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  US [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=14.32s)]
*  Air assets [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=16.36s)]
*  Iran it appears clearly does not want to involve the United States in this conflict [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=21.72s)]
*  I would imagine for the most part they don't want any part of this conflict [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=30.0s)]
*  whatsoever they were in the midst of attempting to negotiate a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=34.44s)]
*  Deal with the United States to allow them to just have a civilian nuclear [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=40.0s)]
*  program [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  You know like abundance would want really basically. They were just trying to negotiate for the abundance program [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=48.08s)]
*  and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=54.0s)]
*  Donald Trump [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=56.6s)]
*  was either [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=58.36s)]
*  tricked by the Israelis or [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=59.92s)]
*  Participated in a ruse to leave Iran vulnerable [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=63.44s)]
*  To a surprise attack [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=68.72s)]
*  he could have also been tricked by the guys like Marco Rubio that he's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=71.2s)]
*  I think it's hired and they could he Ruby [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=76.32s)]
*  I was a long-time hawk and there's so many hawks in the administration too that could have been [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=79.44s)]
*  There were reports about poison pills being put into the negotiations prior to this oh, I I think you're right [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=84.76s)]
*  I mean, it's quite possible that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=90.72000000000001s)]
*  when [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=92.76s)]
*  Netanyahu said to wit cough [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=94.36000000000001s)]
*  Maybe to Rubio we're gonna attack Iran [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  They got a yellow light from Rubio and wit cough as opposed to a red light [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we've seen this before right in fact the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=107.86000000000001s)]
*  The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=111.92s)]
*  was supposedly [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=115.04s)]
*  Because they felt that the Bush administration had no issue with that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=117.36s)]
*  the first Bush administration and this is where like Trump does want to be a dealmaker, right and so that impulses something that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=123.48s)]
*  We talked to treat of Parsi last week. That was like a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=132.32s)]
*  Potentially an improvement but then when that runs into his like desire to be a tough guy [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=135.6s)]
*  GT wrote about this you have a contradicting set of kind of impulses there from Trump [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=142.44s)]
*  Because he want maybe in theory he would want to do a deal with Iran, but he wants to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=148.84s)]
*  beat them into submission prior to it and feel like he won and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=153.72s)]
*  That I don't think it's a coincidence that the bombing happened after Trump's 60-day timeline that he imposed on the Iranians for these negotiations [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=158.44s)]
*  The day after that expired Israel [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=166.48s)]
*  bombed Iran and said that they were [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=169.96s)]
*  Doing and the United States claimed that they had no involvement [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=173.96s)]
*  Despite removing our our personnel in the anticipation of the strikes like it was so clear that the United States was [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=177.16s)]
*  Behind this and no one believes it but they're trying to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  Hands off or aware of it, but but you're involved if you're aware [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=189.44s)]
*  I mean the Israelis in the United States exchange [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=192.2s)]
*  Intelligence all the time and the yellow light means you like hit the gas pedal [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=195.2s)]
*  But I think in terms of providing provable material support [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=202.16s)]
*  I don't think Iran even wants to know that that's the case because then they're obligated to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=206.84s)]
*  respond now [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=213.36s)]
*  The question is will Trump pass that threshold to where it is? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=215.36s)]
*  obviously and undeniably clear to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=221.16s)]
*  the Iranian population [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  and to the rest of the world the United States was involved and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=227.24s)]
*  That feels like where we're at and the bizarre thing that's going on here is [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=230.88s)]
*  I remember quite well the run-up to the Iraq war it was really a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=236.68s)]
*  18 month [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  Long maybe two-year [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=243.96s)]
*  Process [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=247.6s)]
*  Where they were trying to? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=249.32s)]
*  Create all sorts of different stories they were they were literally [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=251.8s)]
*  attacking people who were undermining their false stories about yellow cake uranium and outing CIA agents and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=256.2s)]
*  What's fascinating about this is that there doesn't seem to be it's as if essentially Trump said like well [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=265.0s)]
*  I don't need to I [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=270.68s)]
*  Don't need to pretend all that stuff. I'm just gonna do it here. He is on [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=272.36s)]
*  and this is really the extent of his effort we have video of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=276.88s)]
*  Two weeks ago three weeks ago [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=283.04s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  director of intelligence saying that none of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=287.44s)]
*  The intelligence services believe that Iran is anywhere close [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=291.36s)]
*  To [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=297.56s)]
*  Enriching enough uranium for a bomb that they don't haven't made any attempt that there at least three years away [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=299.72s)]
*  Three years away from having a nuclear weapon and that would be involved [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=309.08s)]
*  They would have to decide tomorrow that we want to do this and go for it full then go for it [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=313.92s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump, and this is I [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=319.16s)]
*  Don't need to send somebody to United Nations and hold up some talcum powder [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=322.2s)]
*  Mushroom cloud no [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=327.76s)]
*  I don't care what my own director of national intelligence says I didn't put her there because I thought she was smart [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=350.28s)]
*  I mean I saw those yoga videos [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=356.76s)]
*  Jimmy door sends me I just went crazy [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=360.28s)]
*  Just the way the Iranians talked to me I could tell they were they had that swagger I [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=363.4s)]
*  mean [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  so [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=373.44s)]
*  Netanyahu is [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=375.08s)]
*  Contradicting that claim immediately right of course, but Netanyahu has been claiming that Iran is a week away from a bomb [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=376.76s)]
*  Since the 90s, I mean literally for multiple decades [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=385.32s)]
*  Yes, there's this a great old footage of him testifying in 2002 in front of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=390.92s)]
*  Congress [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=397.44s)]
*  talking about how the invasion of Iraq and regime change in [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=398.8s)]
*  For with Saddam Hussein would be this like incredible positive for the region [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=404.36s)]
*  And now he's doing the exact same playbook you guys played this yesterday [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=409.18s)]
*  But I couldn't get over that footage of him so [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=413.8s)]
*  Nakedly trying to appeal to our dumbass president about saying that Iran was behind the assassination attempt against him and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=417.44s)]
*  like trying to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=425.2s)]
*  Appeal to his most like base sense of self to pull this country into what would be such a disastrous war that like [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  Progressives are actually regressive the the damn like Iran is four times the size geographically of Iraq [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=435.2s)]
*  And two times the population size and is more mountainous [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=442.64s)]
*  Much more difficult to like the fact that we're even talking about this is insane here [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  Here is I mean this is this is the way that it goes down is if there if the United States [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=451.96s)]
*  Participates in a way that is undeniable [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=458.68s)]
*  All the assets in the region will be under attack and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=462.24s)]
*  Trump will then have to deal with does he go in and attack because [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=467.24s)]
*  US assets have in some way been attacked and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  save face or [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=479.56s)]
*  Does he at that point go? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=481.6s)]
*  Just pretend it doesn't happen and negotiate a deal. I mean this is this is why the next step is so [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=483.76s)]
*  Consequential here is Tulsi Gabbard just so that we can put it on the record [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  back in March [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=496.48s)]
*  testifying [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=499.6s)]
*  To the Senate and they were mad about this and the Israel lobby definitely was [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  The IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and supreme leader [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=507.16s)]
*  Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003 [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=512.12s)]
*  The IC continues to monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its suspended in [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=517.48s)]
*  2003 [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=523.72s)]
*  Good [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=527.12s)]
*  That's it [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=529.2800000000001s)]
*  To monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons program [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  That in 2003 when she said that right which is amazing is because that Netanyahu is using [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=537.72s)]
*  claims [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=544.0400000000001s)]
*  from the International Atomic Energy Agency from back [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=545.1600000000001s)]
*  During that time period in the early 2000s where they had claimed that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=549.4s)]
*  There was some sort of effort to create a nuclear bomb [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=555.36s)]
*  Netanyahu is saying that that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=559.1600000000001s)]
*  Set of like reporting that also there has been some [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=562.12s)]
*  Criticism of that that that constitutes an emergency so much so that it would justify a preemptive attack on the nation of Iran [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=566.64s)]
*  and then calling it defensive a report from like [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=574.4000000000001s)]
*  25 years ago basically look the college football teams have been running the option offense for a long time and every once in a lot scores [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=578.6s)]
*  A touchdown so why would they reinvent the wheel? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=585.12s)]
*  It's it's insane [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=588.4s)]
*  Israel is such a rogue [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=591.68s)]
*  State and threat to the entire globe that we can't be overstated they have they're committing genocide in Gaza [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HtIXnl9Uc&t=594.2s)]
