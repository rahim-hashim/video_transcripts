# Schumer's Book Tour Backfires Big Time
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI)
*  Well, the good news is Chuck Schumer is still on his book tour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=0.0s)]
*  I know people were concerned about that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=7.8s)]
*  Oh, it's restarted. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=9.8s)]
*  That's good. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=11.16s)]
*  I was worried. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=12.16s)]
*  People were concerned when you have a huge fight in the Senate right now that could be [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=13.16s)]
*  teed up on a bill that's going to cut 10 million people, 13 million people from Medicaid, millions [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  from food assistance. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  It's going to cut all sorts of the green tax incentives. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  It's going to do all sorts of damage to the middle class. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=35.12s)]
*  It's going to provide tax cuts for the wealthy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=39.16s)]
*  There's a host of other provisions and they're problematic. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  But good news, Chuck Schumer is out there selling his book and suggesting that there's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=45.36s)]
*  a problem on the left with anti-Semitism. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=54.32s)]
*  That's what he's doing right now as the Senate minority leader. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=58.64s)]
*  You know on the left today we see real anti-Semitism. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  Real anti-Semitism. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  The Jewish deli has a rock thrown fluid because it's... [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  Chuck Schumer! [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  You care more about a sick anti-Semitism crisis than a real Holocaust to the Palestinian people! [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  These are real Holocaust happening in Gaza! [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=84.24s)]
*  Free Palestine! [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=88.24s)]
*  Free Palestine! [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=91.24s)]
*  You are not good! [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=93.24s)]
*  We did not stand for genocide! [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=95.24s)]
*  You are working to lose that $14 billion to the occupation! [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=97.24s)]
*  You came on here to have one of your hands free! [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=103.24s)]
*  Palestine! [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=106.24s)]
*  You don't speak with the Jewish people! [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=107.24s)]
*  You don't speak with the Jewish people! [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=109.24s)]
*  You are Zionists! [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=111.24s)]
*  Zionism is not Judaism! [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=112.24s)]
*  You have blood in your hands! [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=114.24s)]
*  You are a liar! [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=116.24s)]
*  A filthy liar! [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=118.24s)]
*  Okay? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=120.24s)]
*  It is not Judaism! [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=121.24s)]
*  You have blood in this hand! [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=122.24s)]
*  The Jews are burning alive! [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=124.24s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people have been burned by Israel! [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=127.24s)]
*  We will never forgive you and your cowardice! [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=134.24s)]
*  We will never forgive it! [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=137.24s)]
*  Say what I do! [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=139.24s)]
*  Good for those folks. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=143.24s)]
*  Chuck Schumer get off his book tour challenge. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=148.24s)]
*  I mean, he said this is his primary job. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=151.24s)]
*  To keep the Democratic Party pro-Israel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=154.24s)]
*  By hook or by crook, right? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=157.24s)]
*  By enabling fascism, enabling the arrest of people for their free speech, or... [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=159.24s)]
*  By being Vichy Democrats. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=166.24s)]
*  I mean, there is no doubt, no doubt, that Chuck Schumer and the other Democrats, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=168.24s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers, unfortunately a majority of them who are complicit in this genocide, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=175.24s)]
*  have enabled this kind of fascism here at home by continuously backing this false notion [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=180.24s)]
*  that the anti-genocide protests are anti-Semitic and going on a book tour to reinforce this framing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=189.24s)]
*  The Democrats that take Israel money, they're not a whole lot different than Dave Rubin had an ambassador to Israel, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=196.24s)]
*  David Friedman, on right after October 7th. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=203.24s)]
*  And his main thing is you need to enforce your border security so this doesn't happen to you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=205.24s)]
*  They want us to have the same model that Israel does towards their neighbors. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=210.24s)]
*  Just wall it up. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=213.24s)]
*  Violence towards anybody that doesn't belong. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=215.24s)]
*  And that's the world that they're creating right in front of our eyes. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=221.24s)]
*  And Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries are happy, and they're frankly bought to go alongside it [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=225.24s)]
*  and not do any sort of real resistance toward it. It's simulated. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=234.24s)]
*  Trump says he's considering ways to serve a third term as president. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=238.24s)]
*  Every time we call out Trump's authoritarianism, the right calls it media hysteria. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=242.24s)]
*  But here's your reminder, Trump is openly trying to defy the Constitution and run for a third term. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=246.24s)]
*  But if you don't know the bias behind your news, you might actually believe Trump's just teasing us. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=252.24s)]
*  Go to ground.news slash majority to see how framing influences more than your perception. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=257.24s)]
*  Media bias is powerful enough to shape policy and, yes, even Trump's ability to undermine the Constitution. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53tpcTowevI&t=263.24s)]
