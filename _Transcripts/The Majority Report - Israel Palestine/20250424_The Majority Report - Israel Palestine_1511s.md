# She Might Be The Dumbest Person On Fox News
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8)
*  Logan soy, can we please get a shofar for kneecap who have managed to piss off the right wingers and Zionists? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=0.0s)]
*  While also getting out there fuck Israel and for a pro free Palestine anti-genocide message at Coachella up the boys [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  I'm about to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=15.18s)]
*  Made a new fan. Hey, here we go shofar to kneecap [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=17.38s)]
*  I [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=21.38s)]
*  Hadn't seen the movie and I now I really want to see it. I don't know there's there's a movie [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=27.5s)]
*  Is it not a the kneecap movie? Yes, there's a movie and it won a bunch of awards actually [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=31.619999999999997s)]
*  I think it's Sundance related to the band [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=36.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's sort of like a doc you fiction. They made about themselves or with a filmmaker [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=38.7s)]
*  Sort of part they participated in it. Oh hell. Yeah, I want to see it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=44.739999999999995s)]
*  I've heard really good things about it. This is not like that. Um, the monkey one that came out [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=48.82s)]
*  About Robbie Williams. Yeah, who I still don't know who [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=54.18s)]
*  Right and they were like he's notoriously not big in the United States and the executives were wondering why it bombed it's like [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=61.5s)]
*  Because of the first sentence because everything the stuff that everybody knows about Robbie Williams [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=69.06s)]
*  But anyway, go back to the kneecap thing for one second. Did you see did you see the insane? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=73.28s)]
*  Sharon Osborne rant online about it. No like Sharon Osborne [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=78.78s)]
*  She said why why did these why did these bands first of all? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=83.5s)]
*  she's advocating for their work visa to be revoked over this and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=87.46000000000001s)]
*  She's also criticized Green Day. She's wondering why do these bands feel like they're they should be political? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=92.5s)]
*  It's not about music is that about politics at a festival [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=99.5s)]
*  She's trying to make a distinction between if it's your own show you can be as political as you want but at a festival [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=102.6s)]
*  You cannot be political no politics at a festival think about the corporate sponsors at the festival [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=110.52s)]
*  Just think about that. It's not Kalani got disinvited from Cornell [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=120.06s)]
*  This stuff all seems so like a rationally post hoc [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=120.44s)]
*  Justifications because a lot of people just don't understand why they support Israel [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=123.96s)]
*  They don't understand or Lisa unable to articulate why they support it so strongly because they've just been indoctrinated since they were very young [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=127.48s)]
*  either because they're Christian evangelicals [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=134.16s)]
*  I know Sharon Osborne isn't but or they just grew up in that generation [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=135.96s)]
*  Where they were told to uncritically support Israel by whatever powers that be in their country [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=139.36s)]
*  We're taking money from a pack or the Israel lobby or the military industrial complex lobbied [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=143.96s)]
*  And so they can't they can't explain in any real coherent way why they're against like this kind of stuff [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=148.68s)]
*  But maybe she's just reflexively anti-irish [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=154.28s)]
*  Herself so kneecap is an Irish band now. This story has made its way to the couches of Fox and Friends [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=158.16s)]
*  Here they are [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=166.6s)]
*  You know very old men yelling at clouds or at least clutching pearl section [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes clutching their pearls so the old men watching on their couches can [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=173.44s)]
*  Yell at clouds about Israel or about pro-palestine demonstration [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=177.72s)]
*  Thing is look if Green Day if kneecap which is a band [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=181.52s)]
*  I've never even heard of if they want to be for the Palestinian people then they shouldn't be anti-israel [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=186.12s)]
*  They should be anti Hamas and to see on stage a large billboard that says F [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=192.04s)]
*  Israel [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  Unreal it's unreal know this didn't happen in Nazi Germany in the 1930s. This was [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  America [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=206.88s)]
*  Beyond beyond staggering well, and that's what I wanted to ask you was how do we combat this with young people? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=207.88s)]
*  We can see how it got here which is the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=213.2s)]
*  Absolute how do we combat it now? How do I would have loved to her finish that thought we see how it got here the absolute? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=216.48s)]
*  What so that's a tied for fifth place on right there on the right is it not right apparently? She's a she's a music [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  Place wonders why there was this is not Nazi Germany with Israel billboards [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=233.6s)]
*  When was is founded [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=240.4s)]
*  Into that yeah, it's really a great thing that she said that actually because it's a very easy reason why this wouldn't be allowed in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=243.44s)]
*  Nazi Germany cuz there was no Israel [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  A lot of people do not know that a lot of people conflate Israel as it exists now with like Israel from the Bible as they [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=252.4s)]
*  Have not read either so they just go [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=258.48s)]
*  Oh, no like this must be the same Israel that we read about in like Sunday school [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=260.52s)]
*  Or you're just giving her way too much credit where the this pea brain thinks Israel equals Jewish [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=264.72s)]
*  Also some Zionists thought that they might be able to work with the Nazis, but that's you know [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=270.32000000000005s)]
*  We're not ready for that conversation. I mean don't look up her souls of views on Jews [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=274.16s)]
*  Don't look up what Netanyahu said about the Palestinians where he [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=280.04s)]
*  erroneously claims and this is like oddly kind of pairs nicely with this idiots argument that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=284.32000000000005s)]
*  The Palestinian Graham Mufti gave Hitler the idea to exterminate the Jews so [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=291.28s)]
*  The Prime Minister of Israel regularly engages in Holocaust revisionist history [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=296.28s)]
*  To downplay what the Nazis did to over inflate the immorality of the Palestinians by contrast [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=302.11999999999995s)]
*  falsely [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=309.11999999999995s)]
*  That's not something that happened the idea that he can talk about anti-semitism and also say that Hitler didn't actually [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  Want to kill the Jews it was an idea that he cribbed from the Palestinians nasty mufti says everything you need to know [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  That's a very attractive [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=324.52s)]
*  narrative for like racist right for like radius for Europeans for like racist in the US [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=325.67999999999995s)]
*  I don't know stuff identifies races to like externalize the anti-semitism that exists within Western society [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  Right that led to the Holocaust that was never really dismantled after the Holocaust [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=336.67999999999995s)]
*  It was just you know treated as though [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=341.73999999999995s)]
*  By it I mean the Holocaust was treated as though it was like an egg, you know, and that's just eccentricity of modernity [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=343.92s)]
*  It was outside of Western tradition. It wasn't there has never been anything like that in Europe [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=349.48s)]
*  There has never been anything like that in the United States of America [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=354.20000000000005s)]
*  And if you think there has it's because you are in fact an anti-semitic bigot [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=356.76000000000005s)]
*  They don't want you to think about King Leopold in Africa [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=360.68s)]
*  They don't want you to think about the extermination of the Native Americans United America [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  They don't you think about any of the colonial projects including the genocide or they tend to genocide of Indian people by the UK? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  They want you to think that genocide is something that just does not happen or is not practiced by the very very [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  modern and civilized West it's the practice of barbarians in the global south because [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  The they view the genocides that you refer to as necessary to building the West and construction of the West [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=387.04s)]
*  and so when you only think about [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=393.92s)]
*  and you teach genocide as [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=396.76000000000005s)]
*  Exclusively about the Holocaust in this country, which it's one of the worst genocides in the history of the world [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=399.96s)]
*  It's a horrific horrific and heavily industrialized [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=405.68s)]
*  but it's also there to exclude all of the other ones that you just referred to because it allows people to further dehumanize people in the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=408.36s)]
*  global south today and not [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=415.56s)]
*  criticize capitalism or [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=417.84s)]
*  exploitation of people in the global south because they are outside and and the barbarity that is inflicted upon them by the West is [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=420.32s)]
*  outside of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=428.12s)]
*  Our everybody's minds basically and cultural understanding of what slaughter looks like [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=429.64s)]
*  You look up right there this goes back long time before Israel and specifically Zionist massacres of what they consider the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=434.84s)]
*  Canaanites which is to say look at the mystic massacre in Connecticut when basically [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=443.52s)]
*  Massachusetts folks [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=449.88s)]
*  Colonists just set a village of women and children on fire. Yeah, this is the history we live in and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=452.0s)]
*  I just love that Riley Gaines is the is the expert here a woman who has to play the victim for all of what? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=456.68s)]
*  Let me check my watch 40 more years [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=463.24s)]
*  About a event she did in college. That's her career for now. She even swim anymore [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=465.52s)]
*  Like does she even like swim? No, I mean it's been she's been sapped of her will to swim [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=471.6s)]
*  You know, I was allowed though in Nazi Germany, though [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=477.32s)]
*  You was allowed in Nazi Germany though Riley Gaines the dehumanization of trans people. Yes [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=480.28s)]
*  You should look into that extra [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=485.8s)]
*  that was one of the first targets of the Nazi regime was the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=487.8s)]
*  Attacks on I think it was a trans affirming clinic in in Germany if I'm not mistaken [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=492.24s)]
*  So I well that also maybe ties into why so many of these [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=497.56s)]
*  you know pro-israel types love to downplay Nazi Germany in order to [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=501.72s)]
*  Demonize the Palestine the pro-palestinian position, which is an amazing thing to do to both play to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=507.6s)]
*  What Brandon's point was which is absolutely on point that they the Holocaust is used as the ultimate to sort of [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=515.0s)]
*  Downplay other genocides you at the same time. It's almost like they're trying to like kill two birds with one stone [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=522.9599999999999s)]
*  they constantly at the other side of their mouth downplay it in order to [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=527.8s)]
*  Make the pro-palestinian cause somehow look even more demonic or horrible [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=533.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was gonna say there also they also seem to be baffled why an Irish band would have this like [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=540.12s)]
*  You know pro-palestinian sentiment. It's important to mention, you know, like the long history of anti-colonialism in Ireland [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=548.0400000000001s)]
*  Going all the way back to you know, the the British [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=556.7600000000001s)]
*  conquest and Imperial project in Ireland so and the forced starvation that is they very much see in the Palestinian [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=560.4000000000001s)]
*  Experience like this is it's a it's a threat to connect also the Irish struggle with [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=568.2800000000001s)]
*  The Palestinian struggle because there I mean I will just say this [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=575.44s)]
*  Anecdotal I have somebody in my family who read that book say anything which is about the IRA and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=579.36s)]
*  Who was not? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=586.0s)]
*  sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and called me up and was saying I think I little I understand a little bit more about [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=587.76s)]
*  Palestinian resistance [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=594.72s)]
*  Because when you put it within a white context or within that context it makes people who might not be [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=596.2s)]
*  Examining their Islamophobia a little bit more prime to understand it [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=602.64s)]
*  Well, there is the person you're talking about like an American-born Irish person. It's an American-born white person not Irish [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=607.4s)]
*  Say the disconnect for conservatives is with why Irish people like Irish people from Ireland support the Palestinian cause so much is often also because [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=615.2s)]
*  American Irish people tend to be more conservative and so that disconnect is is they just don't understand where it comes from [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=624.6s)]
*  Let's play the rest of the clip and I want to get back to the Mandela point. Yeah. Yeah, this didn't happen in Nazi Germany in the 1930s [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=631.52s)]
*  This was in 2025 in America [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=638.12s)]
*  Beyond beyond staggering. Well, and that's what I wanted to ask you was how do we combat this with young people? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=641.52s)]
*  I feel like we can see how it how it got here. It is the the absolute [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=646.38s)]
*  How do we combat it now, how do we like what was she gonna say yeah her [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=651.0s)]
*  What does Ronnie Gaines know about it? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=655.4s)]
*  that is fascinating, but like this like we see how it got here the absolute what like the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=657.6s)]
*  Volume of dead kids. I'm seeing on social media that Israel's killing [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=662.36s)]
*  What how could she have finished this sentence? But anyway, let's see what they're there [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=666.52s)]
*  They're like they don't see those primary sources of like children being slaughtered because everybody in their a they're [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=669.88s)]
*  Like who's watching that the show is super old if you're watching Fox and Friends and they're threatened by not being able to filter some [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=677.62s)]
*  Of that information for their audience in the same way that showing [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=683.78s)]
*  Caskets during the Iraq war was banned the the absolute [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=687.82s)]
*  How do we combat it now? How do we turn these young people around? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=692.02s)]
*  Well, I think we have to remove these activists from these authority positions. I think that's the best word for it [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=695.3000000000001s)]
*  We've seen these rogue activist judges [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=700.58s)]
*  Of course that's been pretty heavily reported on people are beginning to open their eyes [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=702.86s)]
*  But these activists have infiltrated into academia these large prestigious at one point [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=706.42s)]
*  Maybe considered considered prestigious academic institutions. We have to remove them and of course [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=712.02s)]
*  reinstill the values of [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=717.74s)]
*  Education. I mean, it's really a simple [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=719.78s)]
*  Just filibustering yeah, I mean I do if I turn to like academics [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=725.1s)]
*  This is all about like left-wing academics and left-wing cultural icon activist judges activist judges [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=729.94s)]
*  Because it just mirrors what the right has always said about [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=735.62s)]
*  Academia and mirrors what the right has always had a problem with about sort of youth culture and just popular culture generally [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=738.34s)]
*  Which is it it skews progressive excuse towards the left excuse, you know toward the far end of liberalism and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=743.82s)]
*  Unlike Fox News and unlike, you know our government there's no there's no like inherent need for like conservatives [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=750.2600000000001s)]
*  conservative opinions to be [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=757.0600000000001s)]
*  You know exist to counterbalance it for one reason or another [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=758.74s)]
*  100% the other thing you're saying about with [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=763.58s)]
*  liberals and not really understanding like [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=766.94s)]
*  And sort of this idea that you have to be sort of Gandhi in style pacifist in order to have a just cause in the world [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=769.54s)]
*  There's a complete [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=776.3s)]
*  The real Mandela effect is how nobody understands who Mandela actually was and what the ANC was and the type of struggle that they [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=778.7s)]
*  Fought which included things like the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=787.42s)]
*  MK imkanto way says away or something like that like the [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=792.98s)]
*  Threat of like [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=798.82s)]
*  Sabotage and things like that's in very in a long walk to freedom Nelson Mandela's autobiography that everybody should read [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=800.74s)]
*  there's a chapter very very straightforwardly he says [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=806.7s)]
*  the repression that we were facing from the white supremacist South African government was so extreme that we [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=810.22s)]
*  We went off of strictly nonviolent methods and we consider things like terrorism and unfortunately [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=817.7s)]
*  We realized that that would have a negative impact on our cause but things like sabotage things like infiltrations or things like like [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=823.78s)]
*  Violent resistance to avoid an apartheid state are on the table and that's just the world we live in we don't have a Disney world [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=832.98s)]
*  Where it's like 12 angry men and then one person just has the right ideas and all of a sudden the world decided well [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=839.9s)]
*  You know Palestinian has a right to its own fucking borders. Well, I mean, that's a great point [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=845.78s)]
*  I think just to echo your point the there are two things at play here for me [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=849.74s)]
*  Which is the first is that Americans have had the very concept of critical empathy [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=854.6s)]
*  removed from like the education system both structurally and like [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=859.8199999999999s)]
*  Pedagogically in the sense that like people cannot relate to other people they cannot relate to the struggles of other people unless they superficially [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=864.18s)]
*  resemble them one way or another and [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=870.86s)]
*  That is just [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=873.38s)]
*  Enculturated in people as though it's something positive like oh, you know [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=874.62s)]
*  I have to experience it myself for me to understand it when it just makes you incredibly easy to scan [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=877.5600000000001s)]
*  We see in crypto we see it with the MAGA voters [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=881.82s)]
*  We see it all over the place people just not fully being able to understand something is bad [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=884.32s)]
*  Unless it happens to them or someone they know very directly and the second is, you know [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=888.14s)]
*  The idea of peaceful protest has been I think weaponized against activists in an incredibly a historical way [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=892.32s)]
*  Yeah, because first of all like protesting itself can be considered like at least indexing violence the idea of getting people into the streets [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=899.46s)]
*  like millions of people hundreds of thousands of people a critical mass of people is a demonstration of power a demonstration of force and [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=907.14s)]
*  most of the successful [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=914.14s)]
*  Nonviolent political movements have at the very least indexed past the possibility of violence in history [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=916.26s)]
*  You know the end of slavery abolitionist movement had the context of the Haitian Revolution [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=922.08s)]
*  The civil rights movement had the context of a lot of like, you know discord around the country, you know [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=926.6999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't just Martha King jr. Saying, you know, we're gonna protest peacefully [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=932.06s)]
*  There were other activists who were saying if that doesn't work [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=935.26s)]
*  We're gonna do things a lot less peacefully and then on the other side of that [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=938.38s)]
*  It allows people to pretend as though those in power are doing the wrong thing [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=941.4599999999999s)]
*  They're being oppressive simply as the result of a lack of knowledge [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=945.7399999999999s)]
*  Like oh it's you know [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=949.3399999999999s)]
*  We have to get the right information to the right people and then they'll just wake up to the problem as it exists [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=950.7s)]
*  and so it prevents people from being able or having to come to the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=956.42s)]
*  Real conclusion that the people in power already know they just don't care, you know [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=959.9s)]
*  They or they actively support it like, you know, you can pretend Oh Joe Biden just doesn't know how bad it is [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=963.86s)]
*  You know, come out the Kamala Harris doesn't know how bad it is [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=967.7s)]
*  Donald Trump just doesn't know how bad it is and you see that across a bunch of issues. Yes, they do [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=970.42s)]
*  They just don't care. Yeah, it's like when Joe Biden they're trying to show some Palestinian activists [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=974.3s)]
*  Like hey, can you look at these pictures of dead kids like I saw those pictures and they were brand new [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=977.98s)]
*  He doesn't care. Yeah, it's it's this that's liberalism though, right where it's essentially this [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=982.3800000000001s)]
*  Mendacious [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=989.6600000000001s)]
*  Naivete that is that you know, I as somebody that's like came [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=991.3800000000001s)]
*  Starting my political journey in a more liberal area of thought like that is basically what it is [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=996.4200000000001s)]
*  Which is that it's why there's so many lawyers that they're liberals too [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1002.74s)]
*  Where they just think the the merits of the argument win on their face and that doing politics or the struggle that is involved in politics [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1005.9s)]
*  Is inherently beneath us [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1013.26s)]
*  it's why the [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1015.14s)]
*  Democrats are incapable of meeting this moment with Donald Trump and beating back his fascism because they think like this is like negotiating [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1016.3000000000001s)]
*  contract or law, you know or or some sort of merger essentially where it's like [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1022.9s)]
*  Chuck Schumer will meet the Republicans halfway and there will be some goodwill down the line in the future or whatever as opposed to like [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1027.94s)]
*  No, there are sometimes moments where violence and that kind of struggle is what is necessary [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1035.0400000000002s)]
*  and you can read that in [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1041.5600000000002s)]
*  Mandela's work but also [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1045.88s)]
*  The way that the Black Panthers and even Malcolm X have been erased in many ways from the history books in terms of what we [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1047.7600000000002s)]
*  Teach people and Martin Luther King's image is flattened and distorted [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1054.1000000000001s)]
*  There's a reason that Ronald Reagan was the president when Martin Luther King Day became a federal holiday [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1058.68s)]
*  and that is because that was a I think conscious effort by conservatives to [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1065.2s)]
*  Paper over the struggle of the civil rights movement to create a mascot that would be not threatening for them [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1071.96s)]
*  even though it completely [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1077.76s)]
*  Abandoned the realities and the complexities of [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1082.3200000000002s)]
*  MLK's ideology including and especially his [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1085.48s)]

*  manufacturing consent just to boil it down to [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1096.24s)]
*  What we've all read with Chomsky is that effort to completely? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1099.76s)]
*  Replace history with one that's less threatening to power [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1105.6399999999999s)]
*  With a narrative that's less threatening to power. So but also rather games makes some good points [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJcB-nbjHt8&t=1109.3999999999999s)]
