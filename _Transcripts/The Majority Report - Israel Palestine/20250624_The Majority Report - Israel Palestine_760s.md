# Trump PISSED At Israel
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg)
*  Donald Trump last night announced that peace had broken out, that he had negotiated a peace [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=0.0s)]
*  deal with Iran and Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=6.8s)]
*  Quite a claim. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=10.8s)]
*  Here is Stephen Miller reacting to the historic ceasefire, according to Laura Ingraham's show. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=11.8s)]
*  Historic. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Let's name this war, shall we? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  We have the Six Day War. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=26.12s)]
*  This one's double. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=27.28s)]
*  It's the 12 Day War. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=28.48s)]
*  Twice as good. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=29.8s)]
*  Twice as good. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=30.8s)]
*  Stevie, get out there and sing my praises. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=31.8s)]
*  Well let's just take a moment to think about how historic this moment is and what President [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=37.2s)]
*  Trump has achieved in this 12 Day War. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=41.28s)]
*  Presidents going back to Bill Clinton have said it is the policy of the US government [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=45.0s)]
*  not to allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=49.56s)]
*  But under every president except Trump, Iran marched closer and closer. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=52.8s)]
*  I want you to listen to this carefully. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=57.76s)]
*  This is like one of those, like, can you find the problem since Bill Clinton? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=62.64s)]
*  Bill Clinton was president starting in 1993. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=70.32s)]
*  It is now, depending on where you are, 2025. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=74.12s)]
*  Just on the time, I'm not great at math, but I think that's about 32 years. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=81.52s)]
*  The typical time that it takes a country to build a nuclear weapon is somewhere around [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=87.02s)]
*  five or six years. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=94.94s)]
*  So nobody has done anything about Iran building a nuclear weapon for over 37 years and yet [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=99.02s)]
*  they still don't have one. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=109.5s)]
*  Huh. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=112.3s)]
*  And under every president except Trump, Iran marched closer and closer to being able to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=114.9s)]
*  put onto a ballistic missile a nuclear warhead that could take out an entire city. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=120.7s)]
*  That has been the direction Iran has been going in year after year. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  President Trump took action flawlessly through the United States military to obliterate Iran's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=131.8s)]
*  nuclear sites. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=138.76s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=139.76s)]
*  the use of military force from having a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=141.76s)]
*  It was a bold courageous action and it happened without a single leak, without a single solitary [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=145.56s)]
*  service member losing their life. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=152.72s)]
*  Everyone said who was a critic of this action that it would lead to World War III and instead [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=156.72s)]
*  we have a ceasefire and instead we have the beginnings of a new era of stability and peace [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=161.88s)]
*  and security in the Middle East. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=169.56s)]
*  President Trump once again has demonstrated that he alone has the wisdom, the judgment, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  the strength and the courage to see this nation through the most dangerous challenges we face [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=176.96s)]
*  around the world. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=181.52s)]
*  And now ladies and gentlemen, I give you Donald Trump. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=182.52s)]
*  Probably about 12 hours later, leaving to go to NATO. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  According to the fact that Israel said Iran tried to bomb them and so they started to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=198.24s)]
*  bomb Iran again. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=203.56s)]
*  It's unclear whether Iran actually did try and send missiles over there. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm sure Israel wouldn't lie about something like that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  But here's Donald Trump 12 hours later. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=216.0s)]
*  All those visions of Stephen Miller singing his praise, still dancing in his head and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  then this. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=227.56s)]
*  Israel says that Iran violated the peace agreement and the ceasefire agreement. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=228.56s)]
*  Do you believe that Iran is still committed to peace? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=229.56s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=230.56s)]
*  They violated it, but Israel violated it too. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=231.56s)]
*  Are you questioning if Israel is committed to peace? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=232.56s)]
*  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=233.56s)]
*  the likes of which I'd never seen before. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=234.56s)]
*  The biggest load that we've seen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=235.56s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=236.56s)]
*  You know, when I say, OK, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=237.56s)]
*  and just drop everything you have on the ground. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=238.56s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=239.56s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=240.56s)]

*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=262.56s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=263.56s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=264.56s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=265.56s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=266.56s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=267.56s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=268.56s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=269.56s)]
*  And narrator, this is where you put the narrator in. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=271.56s)]
*  This is what the kids would do on social media. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=278.04s)]
*  Narrator, colon, they did drop those bombs. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=281.0s)]
*  And they were, of course, reacting to something that was semi-fixitious. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=285.24s)]
*  So Donald Trump seems to be mad because yesterday he had a surefire Nobel Peace Prize in his [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=291.1s)]
*  pocket. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=299.88000000000005s)]
*  I mean, a peace agreement between Iran and Israel would probably be worth that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=300.88000000000005s)]
*  Flawless, flawless, says Stephen Miller. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=305.0s)]
*  But Trump's still mad. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=308.36s)]
*  So go back to that because we get more in that clip. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=309.36s)]
*  It gets even a little juicier. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=312.44000000000005s)]
*  Matt, you've never heard this, apparently. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=313.96000000000004s)]
*  Here is Donald Trump. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=316.20000000000005s)]
*  He gets a little bit testy because remember now, he wants that Nobel Peace Prize because [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  Obama got one and he never got one. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=324.12s)]
*  You have 12 hours. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=327.52s)]
*  You don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=329.36s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=332.72s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=334.36s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=336.32s)]
*  didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=344.96s)]
*  You know what? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=346.44s)]
*  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=348.44s)]
*  don't know what the fuck they're doing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=354.64s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=356.56s)]
*  He walks away. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=358.16s)]
*  He swore he's angry. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=360.84s)]
*  He is angry. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=363.08s)]
*  I would suggest that there may be a third party involved in all this who doesn't know [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=367.96s)]
*  what the F they're doing. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=373.04s)]
*  The one that's helping maybe one of the other countries with the intelligence and bombs? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=376.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=379.8s)]
*  The one who got completely rolled. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=380.8s)]
*  In the Washington Post today, Bibi Netanyahu has been planning this attack on Iran since [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=383.8s)]
*  March as was speculated on this program yesterday. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  I think when they start going after Hezbollah completely, despite Hezbollah's sort of restraint, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=399.32s)]
*  the ongoing attacks in Gaza, when they go deep into Syria, I think it became somewhat [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=408.68s)]
*  obvious. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=416.38s)]
*  I will say it is a challenge to cover the news with Donald Trump. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=419.96s)]
*  Obviously we had to do some late breaking guests switches yesterday. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  Then we pull some clips. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=432.52s)]
*  Brian pulled some clips based upon the ceasefire. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=434.92s)]
*  First it was the war. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=438.76s)]
*  Then it was the ceasefire. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=439.76s)]
*  Then this morning there's no ceasefire. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=441.2s)]
*  Very difficult to follow the news. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=444.08000000000004s)]
*  It's especially difficult if you are attempting to cheer on what the president is doing because [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=447.56s)]
*  at any given moment the president could be doing something different. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  If your only North Star is to care less about what actually is done but more about that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=459.44s)]
*  Trump is doing it, in other words if you're a bootlicking sycophant, this becomes harder [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=468.52s)]
*  and more of a challenge because you don't subscribe to any rational thing. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=477.32s)]
*  It is all K-Fab and pretending for you. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=483.2s)]
*  You have to keep doing these backflips. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=488.0s)]
*  Which number is this? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=492.24s)]
*  This is two months ago. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=493.24s)]
*  We have Can We Disarm Iran from Charlie Kirk's YouTube. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=494.59999999999997s)]
*  This is two months ago. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  Charlie Kirk. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=501.4s)]
*  Because while Iran should not have a nuclear weapon, going to war with Iran would be catastrophic. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=503.36s)]
*  Going to war with Iran would be a dreadful mistake and that includes American military [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=510.54s)]
*  strikes on the interior of Iran. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=516.02s)]
*  I'm sorry, I need you guys to explain this to me. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=518.3000000000001s)]
*  We don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon but it would be catastrophic for America [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=525.48s)]
*  to strike within Iran. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=532.3000000000001s)]
*  Even strike, yep. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=534.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=535.62s)]
*  Is back from 1997? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=536.7s)]
*  When is it? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=540.42s)]
*  This is from specifically April 18th, 2020. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=541.42s)]
*  April, April, April, May of this year. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=546.74s)]
*  June. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=549.5s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=550.5s)]
*  So two months ago. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=551.5s)]
*  Alright. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=554.5s)]
*  American military strikes on the interior of Iran. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=556.3s)]
*  Two things can simultaneously be true. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=559.78s)]
*  We need to exert maximum leverage while also saying we are not going to go to war with [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=562.02s)]
*  Iran. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=568.86s)]
*  Doesn't matter if Tom Cotton wants it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=569.86s)]
*  Doesn't matter if Lindsey Graham wants it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=571.5799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter if all the US senators and the deep state cabal wants it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=573.34s)]
*  We will clearly say we are against a war with Iran. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=576.9399999999999s)]
*  Let's play first. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=580.8199999999999s)]
*  Wait a second, Charlie. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=581.8199999999999s)]
*  What if daddy says it? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=584.38s)]
*  What will you say if daddy says it? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=588.5s)]
*  And here is Charlie Kirk two days ago. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=594.18s)]
*  So I'd say the emails are about 50-50 right now. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=599.06s)]
*  Support and oppose. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=602.0999999999999s)]
*  Now if you email me, freedomatcharliekirk.com, I want to hear from you. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=603.0999999999999s)]
*  Please include your age. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=606.8599999999999s)]
*  Please include your age. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=609.26s)]
*  I'm curious if the age has any determining factor of whether you support or oppose this. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=610.26s)]
*  And you might say, Charlie, do you support or oppose this? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=615.74s)]
*  I support President Trump. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=618.1s)]
*  That's my answer. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=619.5s)]
*  I know the man. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=620.5s)]
*  He's the commander in chief. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=621.5s)]
*  He's the man for the hour. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=622.5s)]
*  And he's had the weight of the world on his shoulders. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=623.82s)]
*  So in a situation like this, I support my friend. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=626.98s)]
*  And he's had my back and I have his. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=630.14s)]
*  Good boy, Charlie. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=632.46s)]
*  And let's be honest. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=636.46s)]
*  You're not supporting my back. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=637.94s)]
*  You're licking my dirty little boot. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=640.46s)]
*  Good boy. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=643.3000000000001s)]
*  Lick the loafers, Charlie. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=644.3000000000001s)]
*  Good boy, Charlie. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=646.34s)]
*  Look how easy that was. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=647.82s)]
*  Wasn't that easy? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=650.82s)]
*  Look at what you said two months ago today. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=651.82s)]
*  It's all over. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=656.82s)]
*  Good boy, Charlie. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=657.82s)]
*  Good boy, Charlie. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=658.82s)]
*  That's a good boy. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=659.82s)]
*  That's a good boy. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=660.82s)]
*  That's a good boy. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=661.82s)]
*  Who wants a treat? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=662.82s)]
*  Do you want a treat? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=663.82s)]
*  I'll pay for some more hotels and college now. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=664.82s)]
*  Do you want a treat now? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=667.82s)]
*  You're going to get to go to a big college and have a big debate with somebody. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=673.82s)]
*  Stay to abortion, Charlie. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=680.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=682.82s)]
*  Foreign affairs. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=683.82s)]
*  Good boy. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=684.82s)]
*  Good boy. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=685.82s)]
*  Also, we're not friends. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=686.82s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=687.82s)]
*  I don't like you that much. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=690.82s)]
*  You're a good boy. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=693.82s)]
*  But come on. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=695.82s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=700.82s)]
*  Dude's making a lot of money to embarrass himself like that. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=701.82s)]
*  Principles, ideas, debates. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=706.82s)]
*  First principles. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=708.82s)]
*  That's what they always love to say. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=709.82s)]
*  First principles. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=710.82s)]
*  Because he mentioned the email thing. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=711.82s)]
*  If the email is 50-50, I'll be surprised because his Twitter was 90-10 against supporting [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=713.82s)]
*  Israel striking Iran. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=719.82s)]
*  His Twitter was? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=722.82s)]
*  He did a Twitter poll and it was 89.3%. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=723.82s)]
*  I bet your email may be different because he's probably got an older audience. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=726.82s)]
*  That's what he's talking about. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=731.82s)]
*  Yeah, the chain emails. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=732.82s)]
*  Folks, the number 646-257-3926, 462-573920. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZo9w4pKCg&t=733.82s)]
