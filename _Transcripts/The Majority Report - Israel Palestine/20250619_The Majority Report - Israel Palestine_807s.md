# Trump's Dangerous Israel-Iran Strategy
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs)
*  Trump appears to be coming around to the very tantalizing idea of bombing Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=0.0s)]
*  I have to keep repeating this every single time, but Iran's size is double in population of Iraq, four times the landmass. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=6.54s)]
*  We lost that war in Iraq, despite the mission accomplished banner. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=17.46s)]
*  Murdered hundreds of thousands at least of people. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=23.0s)]
*  The estimates, right. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=25.48s)]
*  It's up to a million by many estimates. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=26.8s)]
*  And like Gaza, we will never know the true death toll because concealing that information is important to manufacturing consent for this slaughter here in the United States. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=29.12s)]
*  Who is really excited about us doing that, by the way? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=38.68s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, they are the ones who have been trying to drag the United States into war with Iran since the 90s. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=42.6s)]
*  Netanyahu in particular, you see his testimony where he's encouraging America to go to war with Iraq. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=49.32s)]
*  And he talks about how you have the first battle, you keep winning battles, you win the first one and then the second one becomes easier and the third one becomes easier. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=57.32s)]
*  And by that time, the United States has already invaded Afghanistan. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=67.88s)]
*  This was when he wrote about the second victory, when he talks about the second victory, he's speaking about Iraq, which we did end up illegally invading that country under completely false pretenses, claiming they had a nuclear weapon or weapon of mass destruction. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=70.76s)]
*  Sound familiar? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=84.84s)]
*  The mushroom cloud. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=85.84s)]
*  Which they didn't have. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=86.84s)]
*  And then the third victory he's alluding to, he's speaking about wanting the United States to go and go to war with Iran. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=88.2s)]
*  And we know that there were many in the Bush administration, John Bolton among them, who was in Trump's last administration, who were salivating and desperate, desperate to attack Iran. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=98.16s)]
*  But domestically, the Iraq war became so unpopular that the window closed for them and they've never, ever gotten over it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=114.44s)]
*  And they feel like they see an opportunity here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=122.52s)]
*  So Trump wants to be the dealmaker, right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=125.8s)]
*  That's part of what we thought. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=127.8s)]
*  And we were perhaps when we had treated Parson, we were a little bit too rosy because it appeared like they were earnestly engaging in negotiations. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=129.2s)]
*  And maybe Trump's better angels of wanting this Nobel Peace Prize or whatever would have won out in this instance. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  But now he's just as despicable as he always is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=147.04s)]
*  And he's not just he doesn't have this desire just to be the dealmaker. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=150.84s)]
*  He also wants to be a tough guy and he's also lazy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=154.52s)]
*  So he's basically outsourcing US foreign policy to Netanyahu and the rest of the neocons in the administration as well. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=157.8s)]
*  And there's reporting from the New York Times from a day or two ago showing how Trump just couldn't help but brag about US involvement, despite Rubio and the other national security folks in the administration winking and nodding at the public to say, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=164.96s)]
*  like, hey, we're not involved. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  Israel did this totally on their own. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=185.04s)]
*  Well, they did what? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=187.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=188.0s)]
*  We coordinated and we got our non-military personnel and evacuated them in the day leading up. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  We knew what exactly was going on. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=194.32s)]
*  It's our bombs that Israel is using to attack Iran offensively when they don't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  And in March, Trump's own director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, testified in front of Congress and said that they are not developing a nuclear weapon and that they are not close enough to do so. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=204.12s)]
*  And the only reason that we're even in this situation is because of Trump, because he pulled out of the JCPOA, the Obama administration Iran deal. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  We are in 2014. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=227.36s)]
*  We reached an interim agreement with with Iran. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=228.68s)]
*  And then in 2015, despite Netanyahu's PowerPoint presentation and attempts otherwise, we agree with Iran that allow them to do this very limited enrichment. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=230.88s)]
*  But there was no way with the monitoring process that they would be ever be able to get a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=240.96s)]
*  And Trump, because Obama did it and because he hates him, just and because of the Israel lobby, true, too, scrapped it and withdrew in 2018. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=247.44s)]
*  And now here he is talking like one of those same Bush era neocons in the White House yesterday, saying, despite the testimony of his own director of national intelligence in front of Congress that actually know J.K., Iran's definitely getting a nuke. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=257.68s)]
*  What's your message to Americans both here and abroad who are not only concerned about the U.S. potentially getting involved in another conflict in the Middle East, but worry about the potential for retaliation here at home? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=274.24s)]
*  Well, I don't want to get involved either. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=285.24s)]
*  But I've been saying for 20 years, maybe longer that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=286.76s)]
*  I've been saying it for a long time. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think they were a few weeks away from having one and they hadn't signed a document. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=293.8s)]
*  I think they wish they signed it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=299.12s)]
*  Now, it was a fair deal. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=300.52s)]
*  Can I just say like him being like C.I.M. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=301.88s)]
*  consistent in this way that is, you know, you all know is a big lie. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=303.76s)]
*  It's, you know. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=307.96s)]
*  But he does that every time. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't think he's not been saying this for a long time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=312.68s)]
*  We're going to play a clip of him. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm actually not contradicting myself in any way, and there's nobody who could find any kind of clip to contradict me. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=316.84s)]
*  It's AI. It's AI. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=322.4s)]
*  And they hadn't signed a document. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  I think they wish they signed it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=326.0s)]
*  Now it was a fair deal. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=327.4s)]
*  And now it's a harder thing to sign. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, it's a lot of water over the dam. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=331.12s)]
*  But, you know, it's very I say it very simply. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=334.68s)]
*  Iran can't have a nuclear weapon, too much devastation. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=339.0s)]
*  And they use it, you know, I believe they use it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=343.68s)]
*  Others won't use it, but I believe they use it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=345.88s)]
*  So that's it. It's very simple. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=348.56s)]
*  So as far as I'm concerned, they can't. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=350.44s)]
*  Can I just say, I don't think they would use it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=352.32s)]
*  I think they would probably use it as a deterrent. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=354.24s)]
*  The idea that they would just immediately commit national suicide by nuking Israel is ludicrous and frankly, like the sort of hysterical racism that is characteristic of Zionists. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=357.28s)]
*  Yeah, they would. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  Israel has nukes. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=369.56s)]
*  The reason Iran was interested in 2002 in getting a nuclear weapon was because Israel has them and the United States has many, many more. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  And they are concerned about, you know, things like what we saw last week being bombed in the middle of the capital of the country, a city that is as densely populated as New York City and has 10 million people in it, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=384.88s)]
*  that they felt like they would feel like that they would need a nuclear weapon as a deterrent from that kind of action. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=399.76s)]
*  And the that is how like these arms races start. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=405.2s)]
*  And Israel doesn't really care to if they get a nuclear weapon because they know that the United States capabilities and the sanctions that we placed on Iran would give them an advantage regardless. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  And like when they try to stoke anti-Semitism here in the United States by conflating Zionism and Judaism, the more that they can claim that they are under threat, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=423.52s)]
*  despite us knowing how disproportionate it is, the more they feel that they can justify their slaughter and wartime actions against a variety of different countries in the Middle East. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=433.88s)]
*  They are illegally occupying Syria right now. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=446.52s)]
*  They've been bombing Lebanon, bombing Iran, annexing the West Bank, committing genocide in Gaza. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=450.56s)]
*  And can I just say they are provoking violence against Americans by involving us with this? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=456.08s)]
*  Like I don't want to like this whole thing where they could come for you. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, if we're supporting this genocidal state of Israel over and over again and giving it bombs and giving it political cover, I don't feel like I'm being made safer by that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=463.36s)]
*  And for what reason? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=475.2s)]
*  Because of Israel, if there's an attack, I don't know what Iran's like, where their heads at with retaliation on this stuff. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=477.08s)]
*  We are provoking something from a giant country thousands of miles away by helping one of their neighbors bomb them just aggressively. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=486.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's it's horrifying because of this level of arrogance, right, that there's going to be no blowback for our support for this state. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=497.56s)]
*  Or if there is, they'll use it to clamp down on our civil liberties more. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=508.64000000000004s)]
*  And like it's the arrogance of the Trump administration, I think really is is clear here in the sense that like Trump seems to earnestly think that bombing them like this made them more likely to come to the negotiating table with a weaker position. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=512.04s)]
*  You killed their lead negotiator. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=529.56s)]
*  Why would they ever engage with you? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=532.36s)]
*  You scrapped up the deal that they were not cheating on because of some petty garbage with Barack Obama and that he negotiated, which was one of the best things he did. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=535.0s)]
*  And the United States has shown itself to be an unreliable, volatile bully around the world where you can have one administration come in and just completely do away with diplomatic policy that was effective because of partisanship and because of [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=547.2s)]
*  domestic, like the domestic Israel lobby. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=564.32s)]
*  And to the benefit of not only the war machines in Israel and the fascist, frankly, in politics and Israel and America, but also to the what do they call it? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  The hardline mullahs in Iran who celebrated tearing that deal up because it strengthened their position. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=577.0s)]
*  All these people saying, well, Dean Phillips come in saying, hey, Iran is bad and they do all these bad things. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=582.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's getting worse because of Zionism, frankly, and the colonial conquest that we are obviously for decades and decades have our eye on in the entire region. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=589.12s)]
*  What the fantasy of regime change is also absolutely horrifying here. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=600.84s)]
*  The idea that this has been proven time and time again. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=607.6s)]
*  We're not going to be greeted as liberators after bombing a country. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=613.36s)]
*  It's this race. It is racism. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=617.6400000000001s)]
*  This we play the clip of Mark Levin calling them savages yesterday, primitive people, and that's how they speak about them. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=620.36s)]
*  It's why they emphasize mullahs or they use this overly religious language to speak about the government of Iran to basically say, well, they're not like the civilized folks over in Israel or here in the United States. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=630.0s)]
*  I mean, so civilized. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=641.8000000000001s)]
*  What was the polling? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=643.1600000000001s)]
*  Ben Gavir. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=644.48s)]
*  What was the bowling? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=645.04s)]
*  Half of them think Fox News is biased towards Palestinians. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=645.84s)]
*  Sixty four percent think there's no need for new images of suffering in Gaza. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7SzfuZdVJs&t=649.56s)]
