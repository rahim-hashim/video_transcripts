# Trump Throws MAGA Into Chaos With Israel-Iran
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4)
*  We haven't heard from Glenn Beck in a long time, but there's a war to sell. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=0.0s)]
*  And so it's all hands on deck. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=4.48s)]
*  All of these people who, you know, claim to be non-interventionist or anti-war or against [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=7.76s)]
*  the deep state or, you know, all of a sudden when it's time for a possible war, wow, now [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=16.52s)]
*  we've got something we can actually get behind and talk about. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=24.48s)]
*  I mean, this is a godsend. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=27.56s)]
*  I think for some of these people, they think literally because the only other thing that's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=31.32s)]
*  happening is Donald Trump rounding up mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, workers to be deported [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=36.32s)]
*  for no apparent reason, or they are cutting literally tens of millions of people's health [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=50.04s)]
*  insurance or nutritional support or Medicare. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=59.04s)]
*  And so to get a war, they are so thirsty for this because it's going to give them something [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=67.4s)]
*  to talk about. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=73.52s)]
*  Here is Glenn Beck explaining that this is not like Iraq. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=74.52s)]
*  This time will be different. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=80.6s)]
*  It's not like Iraq where they wanted regime change and they were going to meet us with [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=81.96s)]
*  flowers and candy and Saddam Hussein is a bad guy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  We love the people. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Oh wait, I mean, it's just like Iraq. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  Has Israel asked us to fight their war? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  Answer? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=100.12s)]
*  No. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=101.12s)]
*  Is this another Iraq or is it something entirely different? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=102.12s)]
*  Let me tell you what makes this moment unlike anything else we have faced before. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=107.0s)]
*  First, this was not a call to war. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  This was not a land invasion. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=114.04s)]
*  This is not a campaign to topple a regime and then sit around for 20 years trying to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  rebuild a culture that doesn't want what we have. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  Even though Iran, the Iranian people are good people, the Persians are great people and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=124.48s)]
*  they do want a life like ours. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=129.4s)]
*  But this was targeted. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=132.88s)]
*  This was surgical. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=134.12s)]
*  This was preemptive, not against an idea, not against a guess. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=135.24s)]
*  We should just say as far as being targeted, it blew up a bunch of apartment buildings. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it was targeted in the sense that they're willing to take out 50 civilians to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=149.0s)]
*  get to one individual. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=154.56s)]
*  How does preemptive in any way justify anything? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=158.16s)]
*  Now first off, it's not preemptive because there was no imminent, there's been not even [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=162.32s)]
*  a shred. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=167.2s)]
*  I don't even know if there's been a single allegation that Iran was imminently going [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=168.2s)]
*  to attack Israel or frankly ever going to attack Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=175.48s)]
*  Our own director of intelligence said there is absolutely no weaponized nuke program that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=179.52s)]
*  Iran has had since 2003. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  So this is not preemptive. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=192.8s)]
*  It's basically, I mean you could call it preventative, but it's basically just a war of choice. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=195.8s)]
*  It's just a offensive strike. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=201.24s)]
*  2014 political. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=204.8s)]
*  Beck admits liberals got Iraq war. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=207.16000000000003s)]
*  People said we couldn't force freedom on people, Beck said at the start of his Tuesday [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=209.08s)]
*  radio show. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=212.84s)]
*  Let me lead with my mistakes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=214.0s)]
*  You were right, liberals. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=215.36s)]
*  We shouldn't have. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=216.8s)]
*  Beck's comments came as he discussed it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  We were messed back in 2008. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=219.36s)]
*  From the beginning, most people on the left said we're against going to Iraq. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  I wasn't. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=224.72000000000003s)]
*  You're going to use that as a badge of honor, Glenn Beck? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=226.72000000000003s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=229.8s)]
*  He's just an attention seeker. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=230.8s)]
*  But this was targeted. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  This was surgical. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=234.28s)]
*  This was preemptive. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=235.4s)]
*  Not against an idea, not against a guess. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=237.36s)]
*  Also preemptive is bad. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=240.88000000000002s)]
*  Against the very real, very stated intentions. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=242.28s)]
*  The accusation that was a critical of the Iraq war was that it was preemptive. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  And now he's saying, don't worry, it's not preemptive. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=251.06s)]
*  It's just what Nenahu said, preventative, basically, which means nothing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=259.12s)]
*  Preventive is a very good example of a very good example of a very good example of a [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=262.0s)]
*  very good example of a very good example of a very good example of a very good example [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=267.44s)]
*  of a very good example of a very good example of a very good example of a very good example [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=272.36s)]
*  of a very good example of a very good example of a very good example of a very good example [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=277.4s)]
*  of a very good example of a very good example of a very good example of a very good example [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=281.4s)]
*  of a very good example of a very good example of a very good example of a very good example [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=285.4s)]
*  The ayatollahs, the supreme leader, the mullahs, the puppet masters of the so-called Islamic Republic [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=290.4s)]
*  and their Sharia law. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=297.4s)]
*  I have said this for years and years and years. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  If you don't understand this, you don't understand Iran. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=302.23999999999995s)]
*  These are Twelvers. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=305.84s)]
*  They are followers of a branch of Shiite Islam that believes not just in the return of the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=307.12s)]
*  messianic figure called the Mahadi, but also that is returning. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=311.88s)]
*  Can you imagine a religion that is centered around an idea of a messiah? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=315.72s)]
*  Who's returning? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=324.16s)]
*  Like a, like a, like a, almost like a, like a Christ figure? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  How deranged is that? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=330.0s)]
*  They don't think like us. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=332.6s)]
*  They're completely different than we are. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=334.0s)]
*  They have this sort of like notion of like a Christ figure who's going to rise up again [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=336.44000000000005s)]
*  in some weird like loony. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=342.72s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=345.56s)]
*  Four months ago on YouTube, new evidence from the Glenn Beck program, new evidence, Shroud [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=346.56s)]
*  of Turin shows exact moment of resurrection? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  Question marks. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=354.48s)]
*  I'll be checking out that after the show. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=355.48s)]
*  It would be really scary if Iran thought that a certain ethnic group had to go to a specific [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=356.48s)]
*  geographic location and that it had to do it by force in order for a majority of them [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=361.12s)]
*  to burn up so that the Messiah could return and that likely that whole ethnic group, a [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=368.2s)]
*  majority of them would have to die in that instance. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=373.08s)]
*  If only Muslims found their holy book, you know, in the ground in like the 1800s at some [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=376.0s)]
*  point. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=380.04s)]
*  Also, that is return can and must be, in their words, hastened or accelerated. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=381.04s)]
*  And the only way to do that is to quote, using their words, wash the world in blood. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=387.24s)]
*  Pause it for a second. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=392.8s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=393.8s)]
*  That there are people out there who are trying to bring about the return of some sort of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=395.2s)]
*  like Messiah figure and try and hasten it and that it has to be the way that it's to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=401.12s)]
*  be brought about is with some type of like thunder and and and like like fire and brimstone. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=407.6s)]
*  Is that my God? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=418.2s)]
*  That sounds terrifying. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  First time hearing this. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  I didn't expect him to make my point stronger in the next sentence about how this is all [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=423.35999999999996s)]
*  projection, is it not? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=428.0s)]
*  And they say there's going to be four horsemen. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  They understand these people do not think like us. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=431.47999999999996s)]
*  If I had heard this in a vacuum, I would have literally thought he's talking about evangelical [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=435.79999999999995s)]
*  Christians in this country and their whole view about Israel. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=439.79999999999995s)]
*  To do that is to quote, using their words, wash the world in blood. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=442.55999999999995s)]
*  OK, I think I'm out at that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, this is my first stop on the train and I'm like, I'm going to get off here, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=450.4s)]
*  please. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=453.76s)]
*  Let me say this again. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=454.76s)]
*  The highest religious leader who actually is in charge of the entire country, the one [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=456.52s)]
*  who commands the Revolutionary Guard, who fund the terror groups by Hezbollah and Hamas, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=462.73999999999995s)]
*  the ones who train children to chant death to America in the streets, believe the world [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=468.52s)]
*  must be engulfed in destruction and flames to usher in the end times. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=473.56s)]
*  And so we play this trick on them where we're like, hey, let's do a peace deal. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=480.92s)]
*  And then we bomb them because they love violence so much. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=487.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=491.6s)]
*  It is. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=492.6s)]
*  It really is so scary. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=493.6s)]
*  that there are people who have a slightly different notion of how we should quickly [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=497.04s)]
*  bring about the end times than we do. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=507.44s)]
*  I like how Glenn Beck's like, I'm getting off this train. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=510.24s)]
*  It's like, but I will get on the next train. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=513.2s)]
*  But with Christians going on the exact same track, I'm just going to wait for the next [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=515.28s)]
*  one. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=519.36s)]
*  It's more like I'm getting off this train. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=520.36s)]
*  And dude, you're at the station already. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  You are just getting off the train at the front of the train. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=525.84s)]
*  You're on the express. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=529.48s)]
*  You're just at the back of the train. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=530.48s)]
*  It's all the same station. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=532.96s)]
*  You're just in the car that just serves a different type of food. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=535.5200000000001s)]
*  That's all. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=541.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like Iraq. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=542.48s)]
*  He's right. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=545.2800000000001s)]
*  It would be way, way, way, way, way worse. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=546.2800000000001s)]
*  It's like, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=549.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, times the size and population, four times the size and landmass or geography. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=551.36s)]
*  You have this problem if you're a right winger because you have nothing to talk about because [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=555.96s)]
*  the immigration stuff, all the polling is starting to go south on you, all of it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=562.24s)]
*  And you have pitched Donald Trump as fundamentally different than the deep state. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=568.96s)]
*  And you have been pitching Donald Trump to young people. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=580.0s)]
*  And the thing that they love about Donald Trump is he's not the same old same old. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=585.0s)]
*  He's authentic. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=590.72s)]
*  And the other thing that they love about Donald Trump, he is anti-war. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=592.2s)]
*  He is not going to get his mired in some type of conflict, some four way country on behalf [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=596.76s)]
*  of somebody else's interest. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=607.52s)]
*  It is America first. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=608.56s)]
*  And despite the fact that the reconciliation bill will cut millions of Americans' health [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=611.76s)]
*  care and despite the fact that it will also keep food literally out of the mouths of millions [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=619.28s)]
*  of Americans. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  And despite the fact that it's a giveaway and some, there's a couple of giveaways, we're [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=627.8s)]
*  giving away several hundred million dollars in special favoritism tax cuts. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=633.5999999999999s)]
*  And just and despite the fact that the overwhelming 80 percent of the tax cuts go to the wealthiest [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=638.76s)]
*  in this country, we still have the fact that Donald Trump is not going to get us into needless [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=644.76s)]
*  wars. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=651.0799999999999s)]
*  What do you do if that's been your pitch? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=653.56s)]
*  And it starts to look like Donald Trump is going to get us into a needless war and in [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=656.92s)]
*  fact has been midwifing attacks on Iran despite the fact that they pose no threat to the United [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=661.76s)]
*  States and frankly, a minimal threat to anybody, no more or less than any other country, certainly [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=672.28s)]
*  in that region. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=680.4799999999999s)]
*  And there's such little popular support for this. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=681.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, comparing it to the fervor after 9-11, this is a entirely different scenario. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=686.0s)]
*  Public opinion about Israel is in the shitter and this administration is trying to sell [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=693.0s)]
*  a deeply, deeply unpopular war or intervention to the public right now. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=698.6800000000001s)]
*  And what do you do? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=705.2s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=708.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, if you're Charlie Kirk, you tell your followers, hey, I think it's time for you [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=709.72s)]
*  to take a little nap. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=717.9599999999999s)]
*  He writes on Twitter, when things are moving very fast and people are losing their minds, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=720.9599999999999s)]
*  it's important to stay grounded. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=726.9599999999999s)]
*  Turn off your phone, read scripture, spend time with friends and remember internet fury [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=729.0s)]
*  is not real life. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=734.12s)]
*  It's going to be okay. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=736.0s)]
*  Don't pay attention to the news for a while because it may not comport with what I have [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=739.04s)]
*  been suggesting for a while. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=743.5999999999999s)]
*  So this is after a couple days earlier he did a poll here of his followers because apparently [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=745.36s)]
*  he didn't know his position on this. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  Should the US get involved in Israel's war against Iran? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=753.8s)]
*  90% of a half a million votes just about said no and 10% said yes. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=757.56s)]
*  And so Charlie had said, Trump voters, especially young people, supported President Trump because [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=764.12s)]
*  he was the first president in my lifetime not to start a new war, which it's one thing [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=768.64s)]
*  to provide defensive support for our allies when missiles are raining down on civilians. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=773.4s)]
*  But there is historic Joe Biden started war. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=777.6s)]
*  I mean, maybe he was his first president. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=780.4s)]
*  I guess he was there for Gaza and Ukraine, which they talk about. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=782.6s)]
*  But that started it as another thing. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=786.4s)]
*  But there is historically little support for America to be actively engaged in yet another [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=788.62s)]
*  offensive war in the Middle East. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=791.76s)]
*  We must work and pray for peace. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=793.28s)]
*  And now it's we need we don't need to work and pray for peace. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=795.12s)]
*  We need to read scripture and turn off our phones. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=798.72s)]
*  Yeah, let's. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=801.04s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=802.04s)]
*  Don't pay attention. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=803.04s)]
*  Guys, we're not going to win this one, guys. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=804.04s)]
*  It's summer. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=808.88s)]
*  So how about you hit the beach and we'll see you in the fall. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=810.26s)]
*  This is like a more scientific poll is the AP that did it a few months ago. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=816.44s)]
*  But I just think this is a really interesting development. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=821.16s)]
*  I saw this cited and I was reading a good article by our friend Ed and Germanic on his [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=824.64s)]
*  sub stack about how like the antiwar movement needs to be rebuilt to kind of combat this [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=829.16s)]
*  and that there was a lot of false promises that were taken a little too seriously by [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=834.88s)]
*  Republican supposed antiwar people. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=840.9200000000001s)]
*  But among the Republican base, at least like and this is probably a reaction to Gaza and [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=844.96s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=850.88s)]
*  But a majority of Republicans say that they want the United States to take a less active [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=852.32s)]
*  role in foreign affairs and only 24 percent say more active role. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=858.72s)]
*  Now, like, again, this changes if the whatever politician is saying it and who's communicating [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=864.2800000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=870.12s)]
*  But this is like what you see. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=871.12s)]
*  Some of these right wing influencers and and like people like Marjorie Taylor Green are [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=872.9200000000001s)]
*  responding to there is like now Fox News. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=877.28s)]
*  Yeah, they're talking to the grandpas and they're very well funded. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=881.64s)]
*  But there's more there's really well funded online Republican media that has a different [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=885.12s)]
*  position on this a little bit. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=891.32s)]
*  No doubt. Here is here is Marjorie Taylor Green on one American network with what was [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=893.88s)]
*  his name again? I've forgotten him already. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=903.6s)]
*  Matt, Matt Gates, almost attorney general. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=906.44s)]
*  Matt, you were joking. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=908.8800000000001s)]
*  No, I honestly, as soon as I can shuffle like one of these characters out of my in the front [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=910.0s)]
*  of my brain, I will do it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=917.84s)]
*  And I frankly was hypnotized by his forehead. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=920.6800000000001s)]
*  I find that fascinating. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=924.8000000000001s)]
*  But here is Marjorie Taylor Green. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=927.1600000000001s)]
*  Remember, Marjorie Taylor Green believes there are Jewish space lasers. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=929.1600000000001s)]
*  So when Bibi Netanyahu says something that sounds threatening, he has control over the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=935.72s)]
*  weather lasers and whatnot. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=943.16s)]
*  With that said, she apparently has decided that it's in her best interest to [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=946.0s)]
*  parlay her anti-Jewish beliefs into something a bit more palatable, which is this kind of [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=953.16s)]
*  anti-globalist. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=959.92s)]
*  This is Pat Buchanan stuff. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=961.16s)]
*  Yep. This is the same stuff. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=963.04s)]
*  Back in I remember back in 04, 05, I would be brought on Pat Buchanan's show on MSNBC. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=965.04s)]
*  He would sometimes be filling in, I think, for Tucker or something. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=974.7199999999999s)]
*  And Buchanan would bring me on because I was the only Jew he could find who was willing [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=978.12s)]
*  to criticize Israel. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=982.4799999999999s)]
*  And it gave him some measure of cover. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=983.92s)]
*  And it took me a while to realize this, to be honest with you. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=987.4s)]
*  I was a little bit naive at that time. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=991.56s)]
*  It didn't occur to me until I think I was at the 2004 Democratic convention talking to [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=996.16s)]
*  some right winger on Radio Row. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1001.68s)]
*  He didn't realize that I was well, I think he knew that I was at Air America, but he [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1003.56s)]
*  didn't realize much else when he said to me, I'm not like one of those neo-icons. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1009.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm like a, you know, Pat Buchanan guy. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1014.72s)]
*  Those neo-cons, they're all Jews. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1016.48s)]
*  There you go. Ah, a little clarifying. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1020.28s)]
*  Candace Owens is also in that bucket. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1023.32s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, too. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1025.52s)]
*  Right. So those are the people that for right now, we need them if we want to pressure [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1026.84s)]
*  Trump not to go into war with Iran. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1031.56s)]
*  Well, they'll exist whether we need them or not. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1033.32s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1036.04s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1036.92s)]
*  We'll take work, I guess. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1037.4s)]
*  Sure. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1038.64s)]
*  Congressman Green, you have been a voice of reason and America first policy. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1039.04s)]
*  Tell us how you see this conflict between Israel and Iran. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1044.72s)]
*  Matt, I see it just as you do, and you laid that out so well. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1049.12s)]
*  That's the America first message, but it's also the truth that the American people have [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1053.48s)]
*  woken up to. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1057.6399999999999s)]
*  We've watched for decades propaganda news. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1058.92s)]
*  I'll call out Fox News and the New York Post. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1061.92s)]
*  They're known to be the neo-con network. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1064.48s)]
*  We have propaganda news on our side, just like the left does. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1067.16s)]
*  And the American people have been brainwashed into into believing that America has to [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1070.56s)]
*  engage in these foreign wars in order for us to survive. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1076.64s)]
*  And it's absolutely not true. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1081.24s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu said I saw on video he said today that America first is America [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1084.2s)]
*  dead. And that sounds like a threat to me. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1090.48s)]
*  And I think that's a threat to the American people. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1093.32s)]
*  And I completely, completely disagree with him on that. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1096.4s)]
*  In order for America to not be dead, it's to stay America first. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1100.8000000000002s)]
*  And this is what the American people want. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1105.4s)]
*  It is not anti-Semitic to say that we do not want to go to war against Iran or any [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1107.72s)]
*  other country. That is not that is not anti-Semitic at all. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1114.3200000000002s)]
*  It's actually rational. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1118.6000000000001s)]
*  It's sane and it's loving to people all over the world. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1120.0800000000002s)]
*  A Middle Eastern war will will pull America back 20 years, just like you showed in your [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1124.08s)]
*  intro for your show. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1131.48s)]
*  It's exactly the lies that we were told after 9-11. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1133.12s)]
*  And many people know it's not true. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1136.08s)]
*  So I'm completely opposed to this war. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1138.8s)]
*  Of course, we don't want to see the people in Israel bombed, but they're only being bombed [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1142.12s)]
*  because Israel attacked Iran first. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1147.56s)]
*  And that's the truth that we need to be talking about. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1151.0s)]
*  And Matt, I want to add on one more thing that I think is incredibly important because [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1153.6s)]
*  Fox News and all these other news stations are not talking about it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1158.9599999999998s)]
*  Last week on Thursday, they held a vote in the Knesset and Netanyahu only won by two [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1162.6799999999998s)]
*  votes because the polling is showing that if an election was held today, he would lose. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1169.8s)]
*  What he's doing is not popular among the people in Israel. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1176.3999999999999s)]
*  They are tired of war. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1179.36s)]
*  They are so devastated after October 7th, but they are tired of war. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1180.96s)]
*  And that vote happened last Thursday. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1186.8s)]
*  And then. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1190.76s)]
*  She's rambling here, but that part's not true. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1192.44s)]
*  They love the genocide part. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1195.8s)]
*  And a lot of them are ready for war, too. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1197.68s)]
*  But interesting. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1199.72s)]
*  I think this is a little interesting. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1201.88s)]
*  Just a little bit. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1203.64s)]
*  Just a little bit. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1204.6000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1205.4s)]
*  Well, she's doing like as you pointed out, she's doing what Trump did in 2016. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1205.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1213.16s)]
*  And why is there low hanging fruit here for her to go pluck like this? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1213.68s)]
*  It's because Chuck Schumer was recently saying Trump is a taco for not standing up to [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1217.16s)]
*  Israel. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1221.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1221.64s)]
*  Because you had Chuck Schumer going out there and basically saying that Trump was not [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1223.12s)]
*  was complaining that Trump was not attacking Iran. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1230.8799999999999s)]
*  No side deals. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1233.04s)]
*  No side deals. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1234.36s)]
*  Mr. Trump, tell the American people. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1235.4399999999998s)]
*  We got to figure out what the hell is going on. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1237.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1240.6399999999999s)]
*  On one hand, I can look at a video of a U.S. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1241.12s)]
*  senator being tackled by ICE and handcuffed. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1246.4799999999998s)]
*  And I'm not going to react until I get more information. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1250.8s)]
*  On the other hand, why are we not invading Iran? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1253.3999999999999s)]
*  What kind of bull is this? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1257.56s)]
*  Trump's all over the lot. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1259.1999999999998s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1261.4799999999998s)]
*  He's all over. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1262.36s)]
*  It's it's crazy town. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1263.24s)]
*  I mean, I have it right here. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1265.72s)]
*  If this is what if I mean, it's just an abdication of leadership. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1267.48s)]
*  Right. It's an abdication of leadership by Chuck Schumer. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1271.48s)]
*  The corruption of leadership by both him and Jeffries. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1274.4s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1276.56s)]
*  I mean, this is the thing. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1277.92s)]
*  How can any Democrat who takes a pack or DMFI money be trusted on this issue? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1278.76s)]
*  Who's the best one? Who's the best Democrat at standing up to war that has taken that [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1284.32s)]
*  money to run their campaigns? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1288.24s)]
*  Chuck Schumer in that video was just so astounding to me. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1289.72s)]
*  Josh Gadheimer. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1292.88s)]
*  I was actually showing that video on Friday with some family because I was just like, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1295.0400000000002s)]
*  this is just I want you to watch this so you can see what my criticisms are of [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1299.0800000000002s)]
*  Democratic leadership. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1303.0400000000002s)]
*  And I said, can you see what the message is that comes out of this video that Chuck [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1304.3200000000002s)]
*  Schumer put out there? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1308.44s)]
*  There's no clear message. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1309.6000000000001s)]
*  There's nothing actionable about it that would galvanize people politically. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1310.8400000000001s)]
*  All it is is saying one, Trump's chickening out on being more hawkish with Iran by [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1314.2800000000002s)]
*  negotiating and two, that he's all over the lot. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1318.72s)]
*  And he's flip flopping. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1322.24s)]
*  Like even if you were in favor of war with Iran or something like that, but you [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1323.44s)]
*  were a Democrat, you're supposed to have attacks that hit them in a clear way. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1328.04s)]
*  And Schumer's attack is just that he's vacillating. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1332.56s)]
*  No side deals. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1336.04s)]
*  Who's the constituency for this outside of the Israel lobby and the donors that [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1337.52s)]
*  they're going to come to you? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1341.32s)]
*  Can we can we just though, for a moment, point out the fact that you were doing [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1343.76s)]
*  this on the eve of your wedding? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1348.8s)]

*  It was during the daytime. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1353.88s)]

*  But first, this critique of Chuck Schumer. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10COlN2Ulf4&t=1360.96s)]
