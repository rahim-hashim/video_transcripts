# Netanyahu Gives Fetterman A Pager
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs)
*  There was a really great video today about everyone's favorite Democratic senator. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=0.0s)]
*  Not talking about Chuck Schumer this time, I'm talking about one John Fetterman. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  So John Fetterman, the Senator from Israel, is visiting his... [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=10.72s)]
*  And he's visiting his constituents. Is he in Tel Aviv? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=18.64s)]
*  He's in Israel, that's for sure. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=23.52s)]
*  But wherever he is... I mean, he's visiting with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=27.12s)]
*  So I'm assuming he's in Tel Aviv, right? That's where the government runs out of everything. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=31.44s)]
*  So let's pull out this clip and let's see... [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=36.0s)]
*  I'm assuming that he's visiting with his constituents and they're going to be demanding [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=40.24s)]
*  that Dovish stop firing them all over in Israel, right? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=45.6s)]
*  That's how those town halls have been going everywhere else. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=50.4s)]
*  This is the town hall he's here for. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=55.52s)]
*  How about giving him a beeper? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  This is a silver-plated beeper. The real beeper is like one-tenth the weight. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  It's nothing. Yeah, but it changes history. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=67.2s)]
*  When that story broke, I was like, oh, I love it. I love it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=71.28s)]
*  And now it's like, thank you for this. Yeah, no, all right. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=76.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=80.24s)]
*  There we go. Some piety. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=84.08s)]
*  Oh, God. All right. So there's John Fetterman meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  And this is obviously usually Democratic politicians. They do that dance [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=92.56s)]
*  between their more moderate constituents, who honestly I don't think they exist anymore, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=102.0s)]
*  but they think they do. Chuck Schumer's the Bailey's, the imaginary family from Long Island [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=107.2s)]
*  that he makes all his decisions based on. They have their Bailey's and then they have their actual [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=112.4s)]
*  real life progressive constituents. And they do that dance where they support Israel, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=117.36s)]
*  but they don't support Netanyahu and what he does. They'll stand by Israel. They give all [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=123.2s)]
*  their support to Israel, but they don't back everything Netanyahu does. They have a one more [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  two percent disagreement. John Fetterman here is basically just destroying that imaginary line [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=136.08s)]
*  that so many Democrats try to hold where they criticize the administration and but back the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=143.68s)]
*  country and the people. He's basically fully backing Benjamin Netanyahu with this meeting like [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  this. And Netanyahu thanks him with a silver plated beeper. And that's obviously a reference [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  to that attack from Israel where they basically sold beepers through third party intermediaries [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=163.12s)]
*  to what was it? Hezbollah, right? And then they remotely set these beepers off, which were actually [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=172.24s)]
*  explosives. But of course, they don't know who the people who got the beepers are with or if they sold [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=182.08s)]
*  or gave away the beepers to someone else. And they don't care either. Yeah, nor do they care. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  Really. I remember I believe I believe children were at the very least injured if not killed in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=193.36s)]
*  this attack. But there they are having a good old laugh and getting a nice souvenir in the form of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=198.96s)]
*  a silver plated beeper over this attack. I mean, it's gross. What do you think? I mean, this is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=205.36s)]
*  nothing. Yeah, I just want to say like this is a Fetterman really loves this joke because the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=211.36s)]
*  Council for Arab was American Islamic Relations, CARE, had to call out Fetterman like a while ago [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=216.48s)]
*  in November. CARE Pennsylvania calls on Senator Fetterman to apologize for dangerous rhetoric [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=224.64s)]
*  targeting pro-Palestinian students because he had representatives of Bataar, the fascistic [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=231.28s)]
*  Zionist movement. And that's Einstein. That's Einstein's words. He met with those representatives [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=238.0s)]
*  who made a beeper joke then to Ross Glick made a joke targeting members of SJP with references to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=244.64s)]
*  booby trapped pager explosions. They love this sort of violence. This ran this, I mean, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=252.64s)]
*  fascistic violence, frankly, and Bataar, again, that group that you can look up what Einstein said [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=258.0s)]
*  about them as the Jewish brown shirts has been dictating to Fetterman and to Columbia board members [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=263.12s)]
*  the names of people to target for deportations. It is shocking that a Democratic Senator is [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=273.44s)]
*  a liaison there and it's just open. It's not even like a secret. It'd be one thing if it was a [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=284.4s)]
*  conspiracy. I'm like, I think Fetterman's, no, it's in the papers that he's dealing with this [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  brown shirt in Bataar. Right. Yeah. No, it's hard to find or even think of a Senator or other member [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=291.76s)]
*  of our government who was more slavishly devoted to Israel than John Fetterman is. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=300.8s)]
*  And I think that, you know, looking back on his positions prior to being elected, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=306.08s)]
*  there are obvious signs that he, like many of our Democratic politicians, just like many of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=310.32s)]
*  our Republican politicians are openly pro-Israel, openly Zionist, openly, you know, by nature of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=314.0s)]
*  those things, anti-Palestine and, you know, at least at the very least, not sympathetic to the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=319.76s)]
*  plight of the Palestinian people or their current ongoing genocide. But like to imagine that he'd [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=325.6s)]
*  be this dedicated to it, you know, he's getting an award in the form of one of their many war [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  crimes. I don't think you could have predicted this. I think this is like beyond the pale. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's hard to even know like who wants this, like who is, like what part of the, you know, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=341.44s)]
*  Democratic party voting base is impressed by this level of devotion to Israel? Like I feel like I've [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=347.92s)]
*  seen him with, and Yahoo more than I've seen him with members of his own constituency. Like he's [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=353.84s)]
*  always like running from them, you know, or, you know, like stumbling away from them, like, you know, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  lurching away from them as he does. But yeah, like it really, it's, I can only attribute it to the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=362.96s)]
*  brain damage he suffered from that stroke that he thinks this is like the way to be. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=368.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=372.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's like conceivable that, you know, I think maybe it was Ben Burgess or Bronco March [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  teacher, one of those guys had, you know, that he's a progressive except for Palestine sort of guy, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=379.12s)]
*  even during the primaries. But I do agree that he would at least be able to make it look like how the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=383.92s)]
*  other senators that are frankly bought by Israel make it look where there's like some kind of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=392.16s)]
*  tension there rather than saying, Hey, yeah, when you blew up kids with pagers and you're just blew [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=396.24s)]
*  up people indiscriminate with pagers, I thought that was totally right on man. Like, I mean, I mean, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=400.8s)]
*  I say that and having images flash through my mind of all the different politicians who were [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=406.4s)]
*  signed missiles to be launched at Palestinians. So, you know, it's hard to say maybe to definitively. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=411.84s)]
*  Also, he shouldn't be allowed to accept that pager. How do we, it could be a national security risk. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  How do we know that pagers not active? How do we know that? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=423.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, let's put it this way. He's going to extensively get on a plane to get home, right? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=429.44s)]
*  I mean, unless he's just going to live out his days in Israel now. And I guess they'll allow [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=433.04s)]
*  the one time they'll allow people to vote remotely is if they are in Israel. Because I guess it's [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=438.88s)]
*  considered part of the United States at this point. But, you know, if I was getting on a plane and I [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=443.36s)]
*  saw John Federer and I was coming home from a vacation or whatever, and I saw John Fetterman [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=448.48s)]
*  on that plane, and I saw that video of him getting that beeper, I would immediately get off that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=452.56s)]
*  plane. I don't want to be on a plane with John Fetterman holding that beeper. Who knows what [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=456.8s)]
*  could happen with that beeper? Yeah, I mean, and the broader point is like our war on terror has [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=460.48s)]
*  had two massive impact. I mean, a lot of impacts on trust, but two very specific ones, which is [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  the vaccination program that was used to entrap bin Laden has led to anti-vax. So how can you [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=470.88s)]
*  trust these organizations that want to vaccinate the world if they're just going to be spying on [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=476.88s)]
*  your DNA in the most sort of like, dystopian way possible? And this, like, we're supposed to trust [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=482.40000000000003s)]
*  electronics. We have all these issues about like, oh, we need the Chips Act because we want the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=487.76s)]
*  supply chains for electronics to not be in our enemy's hands. Our allies are booby trapping our [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=492.32s)]
*  supply chains. Like, I mean, it's unbelievable. Right. And I, listen, I don't typically want to [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=499.44s)]
*  bring this sort of thing up, but she was a major part of his campaign and she's an activist herself. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  But, you know, his wife appears to have gone along with him on this trip to Israel. And I [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=511.68s)]
*  know a lot of people from Pennsylvania who know her work as an activist. She's a dreamer. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=516.16s)]
*  You know, they have been working hard to sort of detach her from John Fetterman's turn. And, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  you know, you can't blame someone, a wife, a parent, a child for the act that their [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=528.24s)]
*  husband or father or whatever does. But going on this ship to Israel and sitting there with [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=534.64s)]
*  Netanyahu, that's a step a bit too far for me to say, you know, you can't blame her for the opinion. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=540.48s)]
*  I mean, clearly she had no problem going there with him. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BNPqJWMubs&t=547.84s)]
