# Ben Shapiro Suddenly Cares About Trump Family Corruption
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ)
*  This is what we would call in Massachusetts, dawn lighting on Marblehead. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Marblehead mass, of course, on the water. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  And this is where I think it's like one of the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=10.88s)]
*  first places in the country where you can actually see the sunrise. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Are you calling Ben Shapiro Marblehead? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=25.04s)]
*  I'm calling Ben Shapiro in this instance, just about to see the light. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=27.2s)]
*  Now, this is going to come as a shock to people. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Ben has what is a very controversial perspective on what he's seen from the Trump presidency. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  And people sit yourself down because you're about to get truth bombed by Ben Shapiro here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=46.32s)]
*  Now, one wonders if this is really like if Ben's just finding out for the first time [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=58.08s)]
*  or if there are other things that Trump is doing that Ben has a little bit of a problem with. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  Any of the organizations that Donald Trump Jr. is connected to are making an enormous [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=71.84s)]
*  amount of money during this period of time when his father is president, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  which raises awkward questions, certainly about Trump administration policy, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=77.92s)]
*  ranging from Trump mean coin to world liberty financial to gigantic real estate deals in Qatar. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=82.56s)]
*  None of this is an amazingly good luck. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=89.76s)]
*  It's not a good luck. OK, it's not a good luck. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=98.56s)]
*  What do you mean by not a good look? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=101.92s)]
*  Yeah, expand on that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  The optics are very bad about all of this incredible. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=105.04s)]
*  Donald Trump is what like made 60 percent of his fortune in the past six months or something. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=109.04s)]
*  It seems like a great look to me. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=117.44000000000001s)]
*  It seems like a bad luck. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  And it's a bad look. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  Take a look at my bank account, my crypto. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=121.84s)]
*  Interesting that he threw in the Qatar thing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=125.92s)]
*  It's almost as if there are [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=129.76s)]
*  a. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=132.0s)]
*  There are problems that Shapiro has with what Trump is doing that are a little bit just off [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=134.4s)]
*  the notion of enriching himself. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=142.4s)]
*  He's made literally what was it, three or four billion dollars off that pump and dump crap coin. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=145.28s)]
*  Right. I mean, it was like, I think like 400 million or something like that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=153.6s)]
*  400 million was the jet, supposedly. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=158.0s)]
*  Oh, no, gosh. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=160.72s)]
*  Foisted onto Trump. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=162.56s)]
*  Apparently that jet, the Qataris have decommissioned for like two or three years and they needed to get [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=164.56s)]
*  rid of it because of the maintenance. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=171.2s)]
*  Honestly, that got a camera. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=174.0s)]
*  I can give Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=175.36s)]
*  But I think Ben is upset because he's concerned about stuff like, you know, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=177.28s)]
*  I don't know if he saw this coming, but Hamas agreeing to a truce with Witkoff and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=183.44s)]
*  the Trump people are not paying the proper homage to they're not doing anything, but they're not [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=189.84s)]
*  paying the proper respect in Netanyahu. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=197.68s)]
*  Wait, the Qataris have a lot of money. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=200.0s)]
*  And now all of a sudden Ben Shapiro is like, I wonder if Trump is like, there's a bad look. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  It seems like he's trying to enrich himself. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=208.32s)]
*  He's in trouble too, because Candace Owens, who they let go because of her. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=210.64s)]
*  Well, none of her previous anti-Semitism mattered, including her saying that Hitler's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  problem was that he was expansionist. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  Keep it in the borders, Hitler. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=223.92s)]
*  That he just did, went outside of Germany to do the Holocaust. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=225.04s)]
*  Like that didn't bother Ben Shapiro. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=232.72s)]
*  But when she started speaking out against Israel. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  Which was right about the time her contract was up. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=237.76s)]
*  Yeah, they parted ways, but since then she's been alluding to it being like not necessarily [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=240.72s)]
*  the best breakup and she's probably under an NDA, but they also let go of Brett [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=246.88s)]
*  Cooper at that time whose contract expired. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=250.56s)]
*  And now there's news about them being in financial trouble. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  He's in a position where I wouldn't be shocked if his viewership is down. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=257.44s)]
*  Candace Owens is through the roof and she's like just doing straight up anti-Semitism [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  in many instances. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=267.28s)]
*  She said the problem with the USSR was all the Jews. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=269.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  That's why things have improved so much since they all moved out. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  Now Ben Shapiro's Jewishness is becoming maybe a bit of a problem with an increasingly [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=276.32s)]
*  anti-Semitic audience. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=281.76s)]
*  As we're seeing anti-Israel sentiment rise amongst voters who lean Democrat and who are [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  Democrats, it's also rising amongst young Republicans. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=291.67999999999995s)]
*  I don't necessarily have faith that those viewpoints are steeped in humanism. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  That they aren't taking wholesale the conflation of Zionism and Judaism by the entire [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=302.96s)]
*  Republican Party and many people in the Democratic Party because why wouldn't they? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=310.0s)]
*  They're certainly taking advantage of it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=313.76s)]
*  I mean, and this is just gives them an opportunity to express how they've always felt about [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=316.08s)]
*  Jewish people and there's plenty of outlets that can give them that kind of content. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=320.56s)]
*  And so what's Ben Shapiro going to do here? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=328.32s)]
*  Is he going to try to differentiate himself and become an enlightened centrist in the Trump [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=331.36s)]
*  era? Are we going to see that reverse? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=335.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=337.2s)]
*  I am joining the bulwark and I wanted to. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=338.96s)]
*  You're now being valutane. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=343.12s)]
*  Let everybody know. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=344.24s)]
*  Ben's talk. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=348.16s)]
*  That's my new show on value attainment. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=349.84s)]
*  So you're at Casa. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=354.24s)]
*  What's the restaurant they always go to Casa de Melio or whatever. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=355.36s)]
*  PBD is always talking about. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=358.8s)]
*  Check out RM Brown was on Tim Heidecker show talking about how PBD likes to go to Casa [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=362.4s)]
*  de Angelo and mentions it about 500 times. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=367.44s)]
*  There is no doubt in my mind. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm like an unannounced sponsorship type of arrangement. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=373.6s)]
*  Let's go to another phone call. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=381.36s)]
*  Come from a 404 area code. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=384.88s)]
*  Who's this? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=386.8s)]
*  We're calling from. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=387.2s)]
*  Hey, this is William from Canton, Georgia. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=389.6s)]
*  William from Canton, Georgia. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  What's on your mind? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=393.04s)]
*  Well, a couple of days at first, one little point and then a question a couple of days [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=395.6s)]
*  ago, you're talking about Trump's thousand dollar baby. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=399.68s)]
*  We talked about it today as well. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=405.2s)]
*  Oh, and today. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=407.92s)]
*  So I missed that part of the show. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=408.72s)]
*  But anyway, I just want to let you know that came from the deck. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=409.68s)]
*  Ramaswamy on the. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=412.8s)]
*  What is that show from the. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=415.92s)]
*  The long, long show with the comedians who they all love. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=419.44s)]
*  Dude with a mustache. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  Anyway, it came from that show. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=426.8s)]
*  I will say, baby bonds when done properly are a good are a good thing, I think. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=429.76s)]
*  But the way that this is structured, it really is just a giveaway to rich people [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=440.16s)]
*  to the extent that anybody is getting anything. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=443.68s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=447.2s)]
*  The question I had, I kind of need you to talk me down because I have this thing rattling [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=449.2s)]
*  around in my head that what people need to do opponents to Republicans or mega people [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=454.24s)]
*  in debates, even interviewers should be saying the thing that you just said is not a true thing. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=462.24s)]
*  And that means that either you're ignorant of the truth, which, you know, we're all ignorant [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=472.0s)]
*  of some truth. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  We can all learn things and be educated. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=478.88s)]
*  Or, you know, the truth and you're like straight up lie. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=481.12s)]
*  And those are the only two ways that you could be saying something that false. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  My feeling is that if you just kept hammering and hammering and hammering, eventually [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=492.08s)]
*  it would maybe not get through to them, but maybe get through to the people who [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=496.4s)]
*  pay attention to those sorts of people. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=500.72s)]
*  And I feel like there's a flaw and I know that you guys can can find it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=503.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=507.44s)]
*  I mean, I think in the main, when you come across stuff that isn't true, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvaqEPZDHGQ&t=509.04s)]
