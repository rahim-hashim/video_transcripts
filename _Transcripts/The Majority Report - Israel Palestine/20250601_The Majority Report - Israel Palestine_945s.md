# What Happened To Anti-Genocide Joe Biden?
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw)
*  Come from a 619 area code who's this where he calling from? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=0.0s)]
*  Anthony calling from Harlem Anthony you're the final caller of the day. Oh [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=5.48s)]
*  My god my luck [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=10.96s)]
*  So I actually was calling because I've been listening for a long time even though he's not a Christian [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=13.56s)]
*  I think Jordan Peterson would say you're doing God's work. You guys are talking about [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=18.6s)]
*  genocide [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Last week I was Israel's genocide on Palestinians and I actually [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  Wrote something for the nation a while back that kind of expressed [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=30.64s)]
*  how my frustrations with the cognitive dissonance between like race and what's happening and how [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=34.68s)]
*  The end clause which Israel is used to say they're not committing acts of genocide [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  It's literally a thing because of lynching and white supremacy in the US [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=48.12s)]
*  And it's been so frustrating for me [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=53.76s)]
*  Just as a black man and black journalist to watch the Democrats talk about race and how it's everywhere [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=56.64s)]
*  except for in the case [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=63.08s)]
*  with [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=65.32s)]
*  Has helped aid the suicide against Palestinians [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=67.08s)]
*  And so I thought I would like to share a little bit about that with your audience because I felt you all would be [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=70.24s)]
*  receptive and hopefully [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=77.24s)]
*  Please do, I want to hear it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=79.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=81.56s)]
*  So [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=83.76s)]
*  Genocide [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=85.76s)]
*  convention [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=87.0s)]
*  the intent the intent clause in there [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=88.28s)]
*  literally comes from the US so before [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=91.84s)]
*  So when the US was negotiating the genocide convention [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=96.32s)]
*  Well, they had to figure out how can we come up with the definition of genocide that would make it impossible for black [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=100.72s)]
*  Americans or even Native Americans to charge us with with genocide [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=107.92s)]
*  Because what had happened previously there were civil rights groups [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=113.48s)]
*  so for example that NAACP have actually reached out to the UN for redress with no luck and so [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=116.72s)]
*  literally the US there was a Senate hearing about the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  Convention and whether or not the US should be a part of it and literally in this [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=129.72s)]
*  Convention you can like read it online or in this hearing. They literally said the US is responsible [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  For the intent clause and even when our State Department was negotiating with other UN members [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=140.76s)]
*  The Netherlands said hey, we have to be really careful about the you know [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=147.8s)]
*  This intent clause because we have to protect against [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=153.04s)]
*  camouflage [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=156.0s)]
*  genocide and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=157.08s)]
*  Part of the reason why of course the US wanted it was because there had been [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=158.56s)]
*  Civil rights group had documented all of these examples of the US government being complicit [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  with the lynching and murder of black Americans and so that's why the US said [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  Hey, we need to have this intent clause in there and it actually made it in and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=175.68s)]
*  One of the greatest ironies is that in order to be a party to the genocide convention each [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=181.16s)]
*  State has to have a federal law against genocide. So we had to actually enact a federal law against genocide [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=187.6s)]
*  And can you guess who the person is that made sure that happened? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=194.52s)]
*  It was Joe Biden. So like how could it sit that? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=199.84s)]
*  Joe Biden got this done in like [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=204.24s)]
*  1988 and knew why it took so long which is because of you know racism and lynching but then talk about you know [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=206.96s)]
*  America's original sin is white supremacy, but not see how it connects to what's I was literally aiding what's happening to the Palestinians [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=214.76s)]
*  I mean super frustrated at the start. This is such a great call at the start of his career [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=222.04s)]
*  Joe Biden was in favor of I think a constitutional amendment to prevent busing if I'm not correct [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  If I'm not right if I'm remembering correctly, that was the whole Kamala that little girl was me [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=235.0s)]
*  speech [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=241.12s)]
*  and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=242.4s)]
*  It's very notable that also I think the tropes that have been used against both indigenous [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=243.84s)]
*  Americans and black Americans are regularly used against Palestinians [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=251.0s)]
*  Specifically the screams without words front splash for the New York Times that had some you know [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=256.52s)]
*  Dubious reporting and just the idea that they are inherent there these they're inherently violent [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=263.04s)]
*  They're like it's a blend of the tropes that we use to justify the lynching of black people and their subjugation [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=270.08s)]
*  But also westward colonial expansion where you talk about people being inherently uncivilized [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=276.72s)]
*  I would also say like I mean and you know, we spoke with Ilan poppy about [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=283.82s)]
*  Biden, you know, he entered on the the Foreign Relations Committee [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  Just in the wake of Fulbright leaving as the chair getting primaried by [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=296.58s)]
*  In Fulbright's telling of it by the Israel lobby and I suspect that Biden was like [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm never making that mistake again, but I will also say that like a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=308.70000000000005s)]
*  Lot of times you you will see [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=315.38s)]
*  politicians do something like that as [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=320.38s)]
*  a way of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=325.02000000000004s)]
*  Like trying to balancing out the positions they've had in the past [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=327.3s)]
*  So just as an example [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  John McCain [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  Was the co-author of the McCain? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=337.58s)]
*  The McCain Feingold campaign finance reform which is since the Supreme Court [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=341.06s)]
*  But the reason why he did that was because he was one of the Keating [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=347.5s)]
*  Five or seven I can't remember where he basically took a lot of money from a guy [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=352.38s)]
*  Involved in a savings and loan and that thing went belly up and so to as a reformation product project [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=358.9s)]
*  He went the other way and so I think you know [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=366.66s)]
*  You know, you can't always look to a vote or an initiative as being is telling the full story [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=370.34s)]
*  Where is that piece is that the piece you wrote in the nation magazine? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=377.42s)]
*  What is the name of that piece? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=382.7s)]
*  Well, I think it's how the US [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=385.22s)]
*  Has [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=388.66s)]
*  Watered down the genocide convention or something like that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=391.74s)]
*  I should totally know it since I wrote it, but I just can't remember it because it came out in like [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=394.42s)]
*  February and I totally get your point on you know Biden and then like the initiative [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=400.3s)]
*  however, my only my only thing about that is this if you're going to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=406.78000000000003s)]
*  Present yourself as someone who is so anti white supremacy [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=412.82000000000005s)]
*  In the US and not see how white supremacy in the US has been used to [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=417.58s)]
*  Annihilate Palestinians. I think that that first of all, it's offensive [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  But then also like the cognitive dissonance is like it's crazy and I get like you have you know [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=430.82s)]
*  He has to do it here and whatnot and all that. I totally fully understand that but for me [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=436.7s)]
*  It's just super frustrating especially as Democrats are like, well, what do we do with the race now that we got our? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=442.56s)]
*  We've lost to Trump and all that. I just think you you kind of you can't have it [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=447.58s)]
*  Well, you can't see it one way you can't see it here and then not see it anywhere else [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=451.65999999999997s)]
*  But this is what I we were saying. I also said you remember why why by not? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=456.74s)]
*  I was a yes. He said, you know [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=461.78s)]
*  There is it you can draw a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=465.38s)]
*  You can see a correlation between people who reject [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=468.26s)]
*  Like the 1619 project he said that the the myth of America being a [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=472.9s)]
*  Promised land founded on a hostile frontier if you're more willing to challenge that myth [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=479.78s)]
*  You're more willing to challenge the myth of Israel and vice versa and vice versa. Yeah, I have a clip [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=484.38s)]
*  Right about the kind of dissonance here [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=489.34s)]
*  This is a clip of Joe Biden from 1986 talking about South Africa and the reason people resist making this analogy is because we have [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=491.78s)]
*  Playbook about what to do with regimes like South Africa and we don't want to run the plays right now [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=498.38s)]
*  And because he was a Johnny come lately at this point, right? Yeah [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=502.22s)]
*  And that we have favorites in South Africa [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=507.22s)]
*  The favorites in South Africa are the people who are being repressed by that ugly white regime [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=509.38s)]
*  We have favorites our loyalty is not the South African is to South Africans [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=514.78s)]
*  And the South Africans are majority black and they are being excoriated [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=519.7s)]
*  It is not to some stupid puppet government over there it is not to the Afrikaner regime [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=524.9s)]
*  We have no loyalty to them. We have no loyalty to South Africa to South Africans [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=531.3s)]
*  Wow [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=538.46s)]
*  Stuff like that that's it [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=541.66s)]
*  stuff like that that kills me and then we have a congressional black pockets that says they are the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=543.66s)]
*  Conscious of Congress or something like that and it's like oh it is like you are in the worst way and all of you guys [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=548.78s)]
*  Like and it's not because they're black it's worse or anything and it's not necessarily like Joe Biden [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=555.9399999999999s)]
*  In particular, I've already been accused of like bullying him and his old age and whatnot, but it's just I it's frustrating [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=561.42s)]
*  to to watch [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=567.86s)]
*  people who anchor their sort of political existence in race, but then completely completely [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=570.0999999999999s)]
*  ignore like [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=578.06s)]
*  Completely ignore or justify or call for a ceasefire, which is which is fine [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  I get it but calling for a ceasefire and that be like your moral North Star is being like I oppose slavery [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=584.3s)]
*  Let's let's put a ban on lynching [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=590.0999999999999s)]
*  It's like that doesn't actually like address the totality of the violence [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=592.02s)]
*  And so for you to use race and then to not go there's actually a direct line between [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=595.5799999999999s)]
*  What we did here and what's happening to Palestinians is just it's crazy [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=601.14s)]
*  Well, okay the first 13 Democrats that called for a ceasefire were all people of color all of them [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=604.62s)]
*  And I remember noting that at the time and you know, I think it's because [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=612.18s)]
*  We still don't have all the full data about [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=619.74s)]
*  What happened in this election? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=622.7s)]
*  But we do know that the Democrats lost support with voters of color particularly men and young people [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=624.38s)]
*  And that would overlap very much with people seeing the brutality on their phones and some [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=630.8199999999999s)]
*  Voters seeing their lived experience in how Palestinians are being treated [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=637.4599999999999s)]
*  But I also think it's a line of demarcation with liberal thought and left-wing [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=641.9s)]
*  anti-colonial or anti-imperialist thought [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=648.3399999999999s)]
*  where a more liberal sensibility is [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=651.5s)]
*  largely focused on domestic politics [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=655.66s)]
*  But when it's not it's often liberal interventionism and [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=659.0600000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=663.34s)]
*  Encapsulated that if you think about colonialism in a critical way and you have an understanding of how this country was actually formed [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=665.42s)]
*  It's quite difficult for you to disaggregate [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=673.22s)]
*  Positive feelings about Israel with [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=677.82s)]
*  From that understanding and so I think like that's part of the overlap is [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=682.78s)]
*  people that that actually aren't [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=688.74s)]
*  Mystified or don't don't [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=692.78s)]
*  Fetishize our system of government or like what it meant to be a [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=696.86s)]
*  Colonial nation and like there's a lot of I think white liberals [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=701.58s)]
*  There the that are not willing yet to engage in that analysis, but Palestine is making it [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=705.98s)]
*  More [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=714.82s)]
*  Acceptable to do so it's well that a lot of those liberals would previously have done things like land acknowledgments and stuff like that [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=717.0600000000001s)]
*  Like what do they think it means? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=722.7800000000001s)]
*  Because that's [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=725.1400000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=727.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=728.5400000000001s)]
*  And then the land acknowledgement say it actually perfectly like captures what I was writing about it in the piece [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=729.58s)]
*  I just found it it's how American racism sabotaged the world's fight against genocide [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=736.1800000000001s)]
*  But [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=740.74s)]
*  Because it's an acknowledgement that like hey there was some violence that happened and [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=745.7s)]
*  But and I'm gonna acknowledge that violence [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=751.66s)]
*  But I'm not actually going to talk about the current politics that still sustained that same exact violence [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=754.1s)]
*  And it's so it's so wild. I used to I used to work in education and one time we did a land acknowledgement [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=759.82s)]
*  And I looked at my boss and I said so if you're acknowledging like land was stolen [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=766.74s)]
*  Are you okay with the violence today if someone walked to you and said I am willing to? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=773.16s)]
*  Enact violence to get my land back like and then they're like, oh well, no, that's you know [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=779.86s)]
*  Violence has no place in politics when it's like well, that's actually liberal thinking and I totally understand that but it's so perfectly [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=784.3s)]
*  Captures be like about to disavow to to say hey now I've done my part [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=791.94s)]
*  I'd acknowledge a crime, but I'm not gonna actually acknowledge the violence that currently sustains that same crime [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=797.5s)]
*  Yeah, are you happy with some symbolism because that's really all we're cooking right now, right? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=803.58s)]
*  It's also cowardice people are very able to [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=807.6s)]
*  Disavow history when it's behind them or once there's like an understanding that said [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=812.22s)]
*  But you know if these past two years have been any indication [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=817.32s)]
*  It's that never again was not something that we internalize as a society. So [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=821.26s)]
*  Exactly it's definitely liberals now and I get the sense to compare Trump to [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=828.4000000000001s)]
*  Nazis and World War two and the Third Reich and all that and then also not the same [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=833.52s)]
*  Also at the same time like he's actually almost more [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=837.52s)]
*  Confederate and by the way [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=840.88s)]
*  Like the not not these based some of their laws and oppression against are based on our Jim Crow law [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=842.04s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm like, you know [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=847.0799999999999s)]
*  if you're if the liberal point of intervention is like the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=849.0s)]
*  1940s and we've lost a plot like the problem is rooted in structures that [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=853.1999999999999s)]
*  You know not to make everything, you know [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=858.9599999999999s)]
*  So leave black thing but like that black people have been pointing out forever and then liberals were like, oh my god [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=860.92s)]
*  You see this woke saying it's so crazy and now they're like, oh my god, our structures are under attack [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=866.26s)]
*  They're not holding up. What do we do? This is like Hitler and then black will to like no, this is like like [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=871.04s)]
*  1870 1865 like Trump is literally like antagonistic to all of the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=877.48s)]
*  Reconstruction amendments like so like what are we what are we doing here? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=883.64s)]
*  like we have to at some point be able to look in a mirror and say well, well, maybe our [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=888.3199999999999s)]
*  Federal college might be a problem. Let's deal with that instead of just jumping to well [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=893.68s)]
*  It's you know, what's going on is, you know the Gestapo and you know, German Nazi Germany was like well, no we had [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=899.42s)]
*  Fugitive slave laws that actually are more indicative of what's happening now [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=906.9s)]
*  And so I don't know it's very liberal to kind of like well, it's us not us. Just kidding [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn4aNurnrSw&t=911.14s)]
