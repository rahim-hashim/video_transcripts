# "You Don’t Know What You’re Talking About!" Palestinian Guest Shreds CNN's House Ghoul
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0)
*  This interview on CNN, Scott Jennings is their in-house basically Trump supporter and he wears the Israeli hostage pin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=0.0s)]
*  Christian Zionist. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=8.58s)]
*  Every single day he's a Christian Zionist. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=9.58s)]
*  Nazi. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=11.58s)]
*  And he's getting more air time because Trump is in office now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=13.58s)]
*  And it's important to point out that he's a Christian Zionist because that is a major part of the political force in this country that is supportive of Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=18.22s)]
*  Zionism is not an ideology that is inherently connected to religion. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=27.34s)]
*  It is a settler colonial secular ideology that can cross religious beliefs. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=32.64s)]
*  Biden is a Catholic Zionist. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=38.18s)]
*  Almost the entire Republican Party are filled with Christian Zionists. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=40.54s)]
*  There are also Jewish Zionists. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=44.14s)]
*  That is absolutely true. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=45.86s)]
*  But they get the outsize attention because Zionism tries to conflate Judaism with Zionism in order to protect themselves from criticism about things like committing genocide. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=47.78s)]
*  Thank you for this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=57.54s)]
*  But if you're coming to this for the first time, that's the way for you to combat things like accusations of anti-Semitism when you criticize the settler colonial genocidal ideology of Zionism. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=59.02s)]
*  Now, Jennings is on here on CNN, debating this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=68.78s)]
*  And the level of arrogance that he displays here is astounding. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  He's speaking to Rula Jebriel, and she's a Zateo contributor. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=79.5s)]
*  She grew up in an orphanage in Jerusalem. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=85.42s)]
*  She's an Israeli born Palestinian and an award winning journalist and activist on this front who has been doing this work for decades. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=88.10000000000001s)]
*  Great journalist. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=94.66000000000001s)]
*  So, Scott Jennings is going to tell her why she's wrong. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=95.54s)]
*  President Trump again today suggested that the United States would have ownership over Gaza, and he said it when he was sitting next to the King of Jordan. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=98.5s)]
*  So how is that being interpreted? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=108.86s)]
*  I mean, I think the Arab League convened immediately a summit and they immediately rejected en masse the whole idea. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=111.86s)]
*  He cannot own Gaza because it's not his. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=121.06s)]
*  Plus, you know, Gaza and Palestinians right to return and live in their own country is enshrined international law. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  What President Biden, sorry, President Trump seem not to understand, the international law is not option and it's not an option for Putin or for him. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=132.7s)]
*  And the worst thing that he is now threatening to withhold aid from two major allies, Jordan and Egypt. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=141.3s)]
*  I was just going to ask you, I mean, today he suggested, OK, maybe we should have a meeting with the president. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=148.22s)]
*  Maybe we won't do that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=154.1s)]
*  We will. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=155.22s)]
*  Because he understood it's about it's not a charity. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=155.5s)]
*  This is what he didn't understand before. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=158.38s)]
*  And he understood it today when the King of Jordan explained to him this was about a peace and security deal that these two allies actually signed with the United States. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=160.06s)]
*  And they were the first actually to normalize relationship with Israel, the first actually to stand up with the Iranian send the missile in April, who stood up to that and basically shut down the missile. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  It was Jordan because of that peace deal. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=179.66s)]
*  If we decide that that peace deal is null and void, all hell can break through the loose. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=181.82s)]
*  And then you will find yourself in a war with a four hundred million people in an entire region that today reject that proposition, not only because it's illegal, but because simply this is the same argument and the same issue that triggered all of this conflict for the last 75 years. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=187.9s)]
*  It's not the first time actually this has been put on the table and the first time it was pretty disastrous what occurred afterwards. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=204.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, a couple of things. Number one, the reason we're here with this hostage situation this weekend is because Hamas decided to stop participating in the deal that was brokered as Donald Trump was coming into office. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=212.42s)]
*  Actually, the Israeli newspapers today says that Israel violated the ceasefire. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=223.01999999999998s)]
*  I know what your position is. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=227.34s)]
*  I know what your position is. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=229.34s)]
*  It's not my position. It's the Israeli newspaper and the New York Times. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=231.34s)]
*  But our ally is Israel and you can't trust Hamas. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=235.94s)]
*  But our allies violated the ceasefire. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=239.94s)]
*  Who started it in the beginning? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=241.94s)]
*  Hold on. Hold on. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=243.94s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=244.94s)]
*  Israel violated the ceasefire, killed a hundred Palestinians during the ceasefire. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=245.34s)]
*  Let's finish and then you can. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=249.94s)]
*  We're here because Hamas kidnapped, raped and murdered and now they're violating this deal, which wasn't even a great deal to begin with. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=252.54s)]
*  It did get a few people back, which I'm sure is the best of what we're going to see. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=257.54s)]
*  And so what Donald Trump is trying to do right now is get this thing moving again because these people need to come back. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=261.54s)]
*  That's number one. Number two, I think he just wants the other states in the Middle East to do something. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=267.54s)]
*  They already offered him to do something. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=272.54s)]
*  To take ownership of, take responsibility for their own region and I hope they do. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=274.54s)]
*  Can I say something? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=279.14000000000004s)]
*  There's the only one that actually put the proposition on the table four times. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=281.14000000000004s)]
*  And this is where it's honestly, you don't know what you're talking about. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=285.14000000000004s)]
*  And I'm sorry to say, President Trump doesn't know what he's talking about. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=287.14000000000004s)]
*  I'm sorry that you and I disagree. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=289.14000000000004s)]
*  There's an Arab peace initiative that is already on the table. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=291.14000000000004s)]
*  The Arab peace initiative was put in 2002, 2007, 2017 and 2024. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=295.14000000000004s)]
*  57 Arab and Muslim countries together told the world and the United Nations this year again for the fourth time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=301.74s)]
*  They are willing to guarantee Israel's security. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=309.74s)]
*  They are willing to reconstruct and rebuild Gaza and pay for it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=311.74s)]
*  They are willing also basically to normalize all of them together with Israel on one condition. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=315.74s)]
*  And the military occupation that's been lasting for 58 years. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=321.74s)]
*  Alright Rula, go ahead. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=325.74s)]
*  Yeah, it was so worth it to play that whole exchange. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  One, her thoughtful explanation at the beginning. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=332.34000000000003s)]
*  Then his just, you know, reflexive Zionist. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  Did Hamas start this? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=338.34000000000003s)]
*  Wow, I haven't heard that from Zionists over and over again. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=340.34000000000003s)]
*  That repeated lie. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  Israel provoked October 7th with their occupation. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=344.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean there's, there is no doubt about it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  The year that October 7th happened, 2023, Israel had broken a record for how many children, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  Palestinian children that had killed. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=355.34s)]
*  Let alone the fact that Palestinians have never been given political, don't have political rights. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=357.34s)]
*  They voted for Hamas what, 18 years ago? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=365.34s)]
*  And then it was prevented from them having another election again. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=368.34s)]
*  And Israel funded Hamas because they were useful opposition to them. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=372.34s)]
*  In the West Bank, they are not allowed to be full citizens even though over 3 million people there are under full Israeli control. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=376.34s)]
*  And then there's the other thing where it's, it used to be about how the PLO walked away from the table. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=383.34s)]
*  We have no choice to subjugate them. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=388.34s)]
*  They didn't take the deal that we offered them which allowed us to reinvade. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=390.34s)]
*  Sounds familiar. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=393.34s)]
*  And now Israel is slaughtering people in the West Bank, escalating it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=394.34s)]
*  They have committed violence against people in Gaza in violation of the ceasefire deal. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=399.34s)]
*  And they are currently bombing Lebanon, attacking it in violation of their deal with Hezbollah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=404.34s)]
*  And what she describes there is the fact that yes, the Arab states did come together and essentially say in conjunction with multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions that back up exactly what they're saying, that they want to normalize with Israel as long as they end the military occupation. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=410.34s)]
*  Over and over and over again that has been said. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=430.34s)]
*  And the right is having a hard time continuing to portray the other side as unreasonable because it's on our phones, but it still is about they're so savage. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=433.34s)]
*  Why won't they accept us? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=445.34s)]
*  They're so irrational. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=447.34s)]
*  Why won't they accept us? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=448.34s)]
*  And it relies on a dehumanization and a demonization of an entire group of people that, by the way, Donald Trump is at the helm of when he essentially talks about ethnically cleansing nearly 2 million people from the West Bank. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=450.34s)]
*  And he's talking about moving people from a land that is theirs and talking about moving them like you would move your desk in your living room or your couch in your living room from one side of the room to the other. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=462.34s)]
*  You know, I want to comment, you know, Scott Jennings performed as you would expect. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=475.34s)]
*  He's a dumb pig. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=479.34s)]
*  You know, he's going to squeal. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=480.34s)]
*  I wanted to see Bakari Sellers on that panel because I have a few things to say about him. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=482.34s)]
*  And it comes to like the issue we have to get Zionists out of the influence of Democratic Party politics. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=487.34s)]
*  Bakari Sellers, some of the people might have seen on CNN a lot. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=494.34s)]
*  He was in 2010, Time Features him as a 40 under 40. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=497.34s)]
*  In 2012, Politico named him one of the top 50 Politicos to watch. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=500.34s)]
*  He was at HBCU top 30 under 30 in July. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=504.34s)]
*  How did he get to be so prominent? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=507.34s)]
*  Yes, it's not unrelated to what he was doing in college, which was Sellers is a prominent African-American supporter of Israel. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=509.34s)]
*  He first attended the annual AIPAC conference while serving as a student body president at Morehouse College. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=515.3399999999999s)]
*  In 2016, he authored a letter signed by 60 fellow African-American politicians urging the Democratic Platform Committee to keep the same language, refusing to include the statement that Israel is engaging in a, quote, occupation of Palestine that appears in previous Democratic platforms. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=520.3399999999999s)]
*  AIPAC Bakari, sorry, the name isn't AIPAC. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=534.34s)]
*  I mean, might as well. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=538.34s)]
*  On October 8th or October 7th, he tweeted out this. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=540.34s)]
*  The news coming from Israel today is horrifying. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=542.34s)]
*  I condemn Hamas and their Iranian backers for this despicable terrorism. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=544.34s)]
*  No country would tolerate this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=548.34s)]
*  I mean, which country would tolerate, you know, Gaza conditions? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=549.34s)]

*  Bakari Sellers has been on AIPAC's list for his entire public career. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=561.34s)]
*  He knew what was coming. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=566.34s)]
*  He supported it and he set the groundwork for it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=567.34s)]
*  And what's he doing in the background of this as a ruliger bills being attacked by a fucking Christian Zionist is he's laughing, laughing about it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=569.34s)]

*  He knows. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=578.34s)]
*  I mean, he's closer to Jennings. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=579.34s)]
*  They work in the same place, but she comes in and says some truth and it makes the Zionists uncomfortable. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=580.34s)]

*  2022 New PAC backed by Bakari Sellers plans to spend one million dollars to unseat Representative Rashida Tlaib. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=588.34s)]
*  I mean, people like really, you have to go into studios with people who are bought hacks for a genocidal government and they just have to act like, oh, you're on the same side as me as they sit there and do jack shit as Scott Jennings gets to attack her. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=594.34s)]

*  And that includes as we all talk about representation, which is important, we have no Palestinian representation that is respective to like the importance of this issue in our media. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_iESG1ZP0&t=662.34s)]
