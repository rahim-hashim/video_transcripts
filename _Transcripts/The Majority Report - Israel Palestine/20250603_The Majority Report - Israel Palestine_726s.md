# Clueless Schumer Focused On Iran
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI)
*  So hard to start with this guy because he's so enraging. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. 17% approval rating, our leader in the Senate. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=4.12s)]
*  Yes, we're talking about Chuck Schumer. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=8.2s)]
*  Now, here is, let's put up a still of this [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  so that people can see, here's Chuck Schumer. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=15.6s)]
*  And now you're looking at this and you're thinking, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=18.28s)]
*  oh, Chuck Schumer is in a nursing home [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=20.48s)]
*  and he is coming out to rail against the cuts to Medicaid [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  that are in this bill that is about to be released [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=34.0s)]
*  in the Senate. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=39.8s)]
*  Now remember, they have about, now, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=40.96s)]
*  I think it's 12 working days to mark up this bill. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=42.56s)]
*  They're not gonna mark it up. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=46.6s)]
*  They're just gonna come out with their own provisions. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=47.72s)]
*  Donald Trump wants this bill on his desk. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=51.2s)]
*  I think it's by, what is it, July 5th or 4th, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=53.36s)]
*  before the July 4th recess to sign, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=57.2s)]
*  probably so that he can tie it in there. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  And so here's Chuck Schumer, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=65.44s)]
*  a brilliant political messaging. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=68.24s)]
*  Exactly, you've gotta go and show how, at nursing homes, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=70.76s)]
*  there's gonna be, these Medicaid cuts [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=74.68s)]
*  will affect people disproportionately [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=76.32s)]
*  because the long-term care is not covered by Medicare [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=78.36s)]
*  for if you're over 65 in a nursing home. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=83.52s)]
*  Two-thirds of our elderly are in nursing homes [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=86.52s)]
*  being paid for by Medicaid. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=90.4s)]
*  Now, not to mention the implications for nursing homes [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=92.24s)]
*  when all of a sudden you have less Medicaid recipients. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  We're gonna see that, I mean, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=99.88s)]
*  we're gonna see it more during local hospitals. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  So brilliant move by Chuck Schumer. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=103.4s)]
*  Showing, not telling, or both. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=105.4s)]
*  Oh, okay, I'm sorry. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=108.0s)]
*  No, I got confused. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=110.36s)]
*  This is not Chuck Schumer in a nursing home. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=112.0s)]
*  It's Chuck Schumer in a Senate office. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=113.92s)]
*  And no, he's not coming out against this Medicaid gutting, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=118.52s)]
*  snap gutting tax cut for the rich bill. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=123.2s)]
*  He's actually bemoaning the fact that we may get back [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=127.64s)]
*  into a nuke deal with Iran. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=131.44s)]
*  When it comes to negotiating [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=135.92s)]
*  with the terrorist government of Iran, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  Trump's all over the lot. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=139.83999999999997s)]
*  One day he sounds tough, the next day he's backing off. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  And now, all of a sudden, we find out that Witkoff and Rubio [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  are negotiating a secret side deal with Iran. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  What kind of bull is this? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=151.32s)]
*  They're gonna sound tough in public [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  and then have a side deal [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=154.6s)]
*  that lets Iran get away with everything? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  That's outrageous. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=157.64s)]
*  We need to make that side deal public. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=158.72s)]
*  Any side deal should be before Congress [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=160.88s)]
*  and most importantly, the American people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=163.16s)]
*  If Taco Trump is already folding, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=165.44s)]
*  the American public should know about it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=167.84s)]
*  No side deals. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=169.72s)]
*  So I text... [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=173.28s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=174.12s)]
*  I just want to make one thing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=174.96s)]
*  We are 100% sure this is not AI? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=176.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=179.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=181.0s)]
*  I texted you last night saying [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=181.84s)]
*  that this might be the thing that breaks me. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  The idea that this guy is out there bemoaning [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=187.28s)]
*  and to be clear, the side deal [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=192.84s)]
*  is that Iran will retain capacity [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=197.04s)]
*  to enrich uranium at a low level, such a low level [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=202.12s)]
*  that it could only be used for civilian purposes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=206.08s)]
*  This is to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=209.12s)]
*  right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=212.16s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=213.0s)]
*  To make sure that like the JCPOA, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=214.76s)]
*  which is one of the best things [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=217.36s)]
*  that the Obama administration did, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=218.72s)]
*  the original Iran deal, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=220.44s)]
*  make sure that they're enriching it at a low level [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=222.0s)]
*  that's more for like power usage [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=224.84s)]
*  as opposed to creating weaponry. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=227.6s)]
*  And we said this at the time, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  it was almost a blessing in disguise [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=232.44s)]
*  that Biden was such a Zionist [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=234.28s)]
*  and such an Iran hawk and a pro-Israel president [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=236.72s)]
*  because if he had reentered into the Iran deal [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=240.52s)]
*  after Trump initially scrapped it up, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=243.12s)]
*  Trump wouldn't be trying to do these negotiations [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=244.96s)]
*  and be the deal maker [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  because he just wants his name on it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=247.76s)]
*  You mean he might actually reverse it again. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  Right, he might be more hawkish [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=252.4s)]
*  because that's how he operates. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=253.76s)]
*  Because actually it makes more sense [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  to diplomatically deal with Iran [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=256.0s)]
*  than fight a war with them, frankly. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=257.96s)]
*  I suspect part of this has to do with the deal [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=259.8s)]
*  because Saudi Arabia now is more interested [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  in backing off of tensions with Iran. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=264.64s)]
*  And I suspect it's coming from Qatar and Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=270.12s)]
*  Nevertheless, I think everybody can agree [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=275.48s)]
*  it's a good thing to have one less country having nukes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=278.28s)]
*  And everybody except for Chuck Schumer. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=282.32s)]
*  And it's his- [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=285.23999999999995s)]
*  And the Israel lobby. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=287.11999999999995s)]
*  And the Israel lobby. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=287.96s)]
*  I mean, Chuck Schumer's motivations [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=289.32s)]
*  I think are pretty clear. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=290.84s)]
*  He's already said that's his number one job. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=291.67999999999995s)]
*  And this has been his number one job for decade, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=293.88s)]
*  over a decade, decades. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  Folks may remember when Barack Obama, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  non-taco Barack Obama. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=304.35999999999996s)]
*  The taco. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=306.64s)]
*  Non-taco. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=307.8s)]
*  Taco Obama. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=309.12s)]
*  Barack not the taco-bama. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=309.96s)]
*  The taco-bama. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  I thought we banned taco-bama. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=314.8s)]
*  One of the best things that Barack Obama did [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=316.48s)]
*  in his presidency, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=320.88s)]
*  particularly in the context of foreign policy, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=322.12s)]
*  was to get into this new deal with Iran. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=324.52s)]
*  And here is one of those hawks that were against it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=327.6s)]
*  A key democratic senator and ally of the president [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=332.56s)]
*  says he will vote no on Mr. Obama's deal [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=336.44s)]
*  to limit Iran's nuclear program. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=339.48s)]
*  Nancy Cordes on what this means. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=342.04s)]
*  How can we compare the two sides? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=344.84s)]
*  New York Senator Chuck Schumer is next in line [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=347.2s)]
*  to be Democratic leader, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=350.0s)]
*  the president's top emissary in the Senate. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=351.56s)]
*  But he's also the most prominent Jewish member of Congress [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=354.32s)]

*  And that's the side that won out Thursday [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=360.36s)]
*  when Schumer announced that he must oppose [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  the agreement with Iran because of its serious weaknesses. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=365.56s)]
*  Lifting sanctions on Iran, Schumer wrote, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=369.6s)]
*  would leave it stronger financially [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=371.72s)]
*  and better able to carry out terrorist actions [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  in Israel, Syria, and other Middle Eastern countries. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  White House press secretary Josh Earnest [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  said Schumer might pay a price for that position. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  I certainly wouldn't be surprised [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=385.36s)]
*  if there are individual members [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=386.68s)]
*  of the Senate Democratic caucus [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=388.12s)]
*  that will consider the voting record [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=391.8s)]
*  of those who say they would like to lead the caucus. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=395.12s)]
*  Congress votes on the deal next month [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=397.76s)]
*  and things don't look. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=399.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Nope. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=401.76s)]
*  Apparently they didn't. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=403.08s)]
*  That was 2015. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=404.72s)]
*  And you can see obviously Chuck Schumer became leader, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=407.04s)]
*  but how even though Obama, he was on his way out, right? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  So not a lame duck quite yet, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  but he didn't have the power over the Israel lobby [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=415.76s)]
*  to make this determination. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=419.36s)]
*  Netanyahu at this time was in an all out public relations [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  blitz to say that Iran was cheating on the nuclear deal [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  without evidence. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=429.8s)]
*  I remember just before I even was working in this industry, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=430.64s)]
*  watching in disbelief the video of him doing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=434.44s)]
*  a PowerPoint presentation with all of these lies, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  trying to get the rest of Republicans and Democrats [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=440.12s)]
*  to try to get Obama to remove himself from this peace deal. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=444.64s)]
*  It was diplomacy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=449.12s)]
*  This is the kind of stuff we should be engaging in. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=450.16s)]
*  And there was no evidence that they were cheating [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=452.20000000000005s)]
*  on the nuclear deal, but Chuck Schumer, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=454.04s)]
*  he's the Democratic leader and APAC won in that instance. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=456.68s)]
*  And this is what, I mean, talk about side deals. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  There it is. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  This guy doesn't have, Chuck Schumer doesn't have [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=465.12s)]
*  something else to fight. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=468.72s)]
*  His big stand, his big, I'm going to use, listen, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=471.12s)]
*  we can only use bullshit once or twice. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=474.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm going to deploy it very judiciously. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=477.56s)]
*  He said bull. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=480.52s)]
*  What kind of bull is this? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=481.36s)]
*  I'm going to use the bull. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=482.76s)]
*  What kind of bull is this? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=485.24s)]
*  I'm going to use this very judiciously. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=486.92s)]
*  He's all the guy's been doing, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=489.96s)]
*  he's been going on his book tour [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=491.76s)]
*  and now coming out and trying to scuttle a peace deal [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=494.36s)]
*  with Iran as if there's nothing else going on. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=498.08s)]
*  It's just insane. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  It's just insane. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=504.4s)]
*  And this coming on the heels yesterday, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=505.48s)]
*  we played that new polling that CNN featured [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=507.28s)]
*  about how both Democrats and Republicans [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=511.76s)]
*  see Democratic leaders as weak and ineffectual [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=514.88s)]
*  and doing nothing. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=519.16s)]
*  It's just, this is like, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=521.52s)]
*  the person writing a history book [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=528.12s)]
*  about the way the Democrats are operating right now, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=530.36s)]
*  it's going to be astonishing. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=533.56s)]
*  This person 10, 15 years from now, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=535.8399999999999s)]
*  who's writing about this era is just going to be like, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=538.5999999999999s)]
*  this is nuts. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=541.4s)]
*  Right, and like the idea that we're trying to get Trump, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=542.68s)]
*  TACO stands for Trump Always Chickens Out. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=545.92s)]
*  What is he chickening out of here, Chuck, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=549.1199999999999s)]
*  by engaging in diplomacy with Iran? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=552.5999999999999s)]
*  Do you know what a war with Iran would look like? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=554.76s)]
*  It would make Iraq look like a cupcake. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=556.76s)]
*  Iran is even bigger, more mountainous, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=559.52s)]
*  and Israel has been trying to pull the United States [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  into a war with Iran since I have been alive, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=566.64s)]
*  and Chuck Schumer is enabling that. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=569.72s)]
*  This would be so catastrophic, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=572.04s)]
*  and that's why we call these [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=573.92s)]
*  Democratic Zionists fascist enablers, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=576.16s)]
*  both warmongers and fascist enablers here at home, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=579.3199999999999s)]
*  because this is what he's focused on [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=583.12s)]
*  as people are getting rounded up at work, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  as people's speech opposing this genocide [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=587.72s)]
*  are being locked up. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=590.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, I will tell you. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=593.4799999999999s)]
*  Trump's all over the lot. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=594.4799999999999s)]
*  One day he sounds tough. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=595.52s)]
*  The next. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=596.92s)]
*  Right, one day he sounds tough. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=597.76s)]
*  What even is the message out of here, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=599.52s)]
*  because he half asses it too, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=601.0s)]
*  which is a total liberal Zionist thing to do. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=602.52s)]

*  I will tell you though, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  the Bailey's have been boycotting kebabs. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=606.9599999999999s)]

*  I mean, I should say Persian food, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=613.64s)]

*  This isn't, actually, that's a point. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=643.44s)]
*  This isn't about Chuck Schumer. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=644.84s)]
*  This is about the party that should have disciplined him [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=645.88s)]
*  for going against Obama's diplomacy in 2015 [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy-0VZ1CWaI&t=648.6s)]
