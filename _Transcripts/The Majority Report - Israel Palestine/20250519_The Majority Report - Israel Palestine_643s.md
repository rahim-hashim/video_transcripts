# Grad Speaker Shames GW University For Funding Israel’s Gaza Genocide
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc)
*  Cecilia Culver, she is a student at George Washington University. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=0.0s)]
*  And we have seen in the, you know, over the past week or so, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=4.04s)]
*  graduations where students have gotten up. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=8.92s)]
*  We had one student from NYU who got up and gave an extremely [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  brief speech and a brief mention that like, I feel ashamed of our country [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=19.16s)]
*  and us for participating in enabling this genocide sat down. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=24.68s)]
*  And specifically NYU and its investment in Israel, too. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=29.8s)]
*  I think he was also calling that out. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=35.08s)]
*  And what's kept from getting their diploma and. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=36.8s)]
*  It is. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=45.84s)]
*  It is, I mean, it's impressive to see these students speak out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=48.64s)]
*  It takes a lot of courage. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=52.72s)]
*  Here is again, Cecilia Culver, and you can tell she's nervous. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=55.08s)]
*  She has every right to be scared about for what she's about to do, but good for her. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  Great. Yeah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=65.52s)]
*  For over a year, we have watched the genocide be committed against Palestinians. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=66.64s)]
*  I cannot celebrate my own graduation without a heavy heart. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=83.92s)]
*  Knowing how many students in Palestine have been forced to stop their studies, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=87.6s)]
*  expelled from their homes and killed for simply remaining in the country of their ancestors. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=91.32s)]
*  The horrors unfolding halfway across the world may be easy to ignore [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=110.44s)]
*  for those lacking a moral backbone. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=114.32s)]
*  For the rest of us. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=116.68s)]
*  For the rest of us, these atrocities cause us to take stock [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=124.0s)]
*  in our own complacency in the imperialist system. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  I am ashamed to know my tuition is being used to fund genocide. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=130.52s)]
*  I'm going to say that again. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=136.32s)]
*  I am ashamed to know my tuition is being used to fund this genocide. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=137.84s)]
*  Every year, the cost of attending this university increases [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=146.64s)]
*  without a corresponding improvement in the facilities and resources [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=149.92s)]
*  provided to students, staff and faculty. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  Instead, our money is put into the pockets of those who unequivocally prove [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  time and time again, they do not care about the students and faculty [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  that create this university's prestigious university. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=163.32s)]
*  Despite repeated calls from students and faculty to disclose all endowments [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=166.0s)]
*  and investments by the university and divest from the apartheid state of Israel, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=170.12s)]
*  the administration has refused to negotiate in good faith. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  I mean, she goes on, wraps up in about another minute or so, but it was impressive. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=195.8s)]
*  I love these kids. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=209.8s)]
*  I love the roar of relief from the student body. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  That's like we're not going to go through this charade [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=214.8s)]
*  and be silenced about the key issue of our time. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=218.44s)]
*  I said this last year when this was going on. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=222.0s)]
*  I spoke at my graduation, Mike from PA found a clip of it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  My speech was actually kind of an abundance thing because during the recession, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  like we need to like be used to government to build things. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  If this was going on, I would be ashamed of myself [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  if I hadn't spoken out the way these kids are. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  And to be honest, I've kind of been ashamed. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=240.64s)]
*  I didn't find a more important issue when I did. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's tough. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  I can say that, like, you know, this notion of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  of pushing endowments to divest, right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=250.44s)]
*  There is a real precedent for this in terms of South Africa [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=255.08s)]
*  during the mid 80s. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=261.12s)]
*  That was like the push at our schools. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  There was a little bit more institutional support outside of the schools for [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=266.24s)]
*  something called the Sullivan principles, which had been written up about [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  that that sort of provided guidelines. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=278.32s)]
*  Folks, I can't even remember exactly what they were, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  but they came out of a desire to protest these things. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  You had Reagan even was there was an acknowledgement that there was a problem [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=288.64s)]
*  in a way that we don't see from the leadership in this country, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=293.12s)]
*  Democrat or well, Democrat or Republican. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  And we see it with some Democrats. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=302.28s)]
*  But there was an acknowledgement of a of something wrong [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=304.28s)]
*  with the country. And Reagan's whole push was constructive engagement. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=307.28s)]
*  We need to we need to be there to push them in the right direction. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=311.76s)]
*  A lot of people are saying, like, you know, that time has passed for that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=314.52s)]
*  But so a lot of these students are out there on their own and they're in many ways. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=318.35999999999996s)]
*  The the flow of protest seems to be moving the other direction [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=325.52s)]
*  than it was during the era of the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=329.2s)]
*  protests against South Africa, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=334.2s)]
*  where, you know, college campuses came after there was like already a groundswell [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  of public and in many respects, I feel like the college campuses are driving this or were. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=342.0s)]
*  Well, the administrators. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=347.79999999999995s)]
*  Another thing to note is you see the professors being very studious to not [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=349.47999999999996s)]
*  to show what's on their face or their reaction. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=355.76s)]
*  But do you think they do you think they love this? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=358.12s)]
*  You think that the professors, people who are there trying to teach these children [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=361.0s)]
*  not children, kid young people to engage in critical thinking [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=366.12s)]
*  and to think about the world in ways that, I don't know, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=371.56s)]
*  challenge power or their academics, right? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=376.32s)]
*  You think they like this? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=379.96s)]
*  They think they'd like the administration silencing their students [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=380.96s)]
*  and telling them not the best of their graduating class, not and to to silence [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=384.4s)]
*  themselves and to not be brave like they all are also facing incredible pressure. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=389.44s)]
*  This is the administration. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=394.52s)]
*  This is capitalism. It's not academia. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=395.84s)]
*  And it's not about anti-Semitism. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=398.28s)]
*  And I don't know why you'd want a leadership position in a role [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=399.76s)]
*  just to be cowardly in moments like this. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=402.48s)]
*  Like, I'm sure the the rent paying is nice, but I mean, grow back bone. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=404.72s)]
*  Yeah. And we saw this, I guess, Matt and I both saw this on social media. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=410.28s)]
*  I sent this to my my cousin who went to NYU [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=415.12s)]
*  because I think it's relatable here. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=419.0s)]
*  But we played the NYU kids speech on on Thursday. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=420.8s)]
*  This is Zach Woods from Silicon Valley, from the office, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=426.36s)]
*  whose Instagram account is very funny commenting on it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=431.04s)]
*  I guess he's commenting on that NYU specifically on that NYU student [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=434.56s)]
*  who had their diploma suspended because they dared to mention [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=440.36s)]
*  the genocide that's going on. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=446.16s)]
*  It's just absolutely stunning. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=447.8s)]
*  And just a quick say, Prem talker of Zateo has said that the student [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=449.88s)]
*  that George Washington is also under investigation. Insane. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=453.96s)]
*  This week, my alma mater, NYU, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=459.16s)]
*  heroically withheld the diploma of one of their students [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=461.2s)]
*  who used their graduation speech to speak out against war crimes. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=464.84000000000003s)]
*  Bravo. And to that student, I asked, did NYU teach you nothing? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=468.84000000000003s)]
*  Your values are for brochures and for marketing, not for real life enactment. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  You silly fucking goose. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=479.47999999999996s)]
*  NYU is about impoverishing your family with ludicrous tuition bills [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=481.28s)]
*  while developing a severe addiction to ketamine and manga websites and falafel. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=486.23999999999995s)]
*  It's about the romance of going to the Wells Fargo [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=491.84s)]
*  that used to be CBGB and taking money out of the ATM [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=495.64s)]
*  and using it to buy ayahuasca from a finance major named [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=499.32s)]
*  Coltridge Eaton or Eaton Coltridge. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=503.68s)]
*  You'll never be 100 percent sure. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=506.6s)]
*  And he claims he's a shaman because one of his nannies spoke Portuguese. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=508.88s)]
*  So you follow Coltridge or Eaton into the dormitory [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=512.64s)]
*  that used to be the Triangle Shirtwaist factory where you do the ayahuasca [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=515.64s)]
*  and you have the trip of a lifetime until you spot in the corner [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=519.76s)]
*  a translucent little girl sitting at a loom. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=523.4s)]
*  And she's giving you a very shitty and judgy look, which traumatizes you. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  So you go to the counseling center where you tell them about this horror [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=531.2399999999999s)]
*  and you're put on a list and suspended because you're a financial liability [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=534.68s)]
*  and a suicide risk because the shitty loom girl told you [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=538.4399999999999s)]
*  that you're living an expensive, empty cliche. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=542.12s)]
*  That is the magic of NYU. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDoIG2SBdc&t=544.8s)]
