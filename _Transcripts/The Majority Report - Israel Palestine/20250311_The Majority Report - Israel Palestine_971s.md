# CNN Panel FED UP With Republican's BS
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs)
*  A federal judge stopped the Trump administration's DHS from deporting a student who has a green [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=0.0s)]
*  card and also an eight month pregnant wife. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=9.96s)]
*  Who's an American? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=13.72s)]
*  Who's an American who is accused of protesting in a way that the U.S. government feels is [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=15.08s)]
*  supportive in some way of Hamas? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  There's no criminal charges that they seem to have levied. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=29.92s)]
*  They basically say that he's been supporting Hamas and that makes students feel uncomfortable. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=32.76s)]
*  But there's no specificity to the claim. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=39.12s)]
*  I don't think they've even been saying supporting. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=41.68s)]
*  They've said aligned. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=46.0s)]
*  Aligned. Which is this is a cut and dry free speech issue. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=47.32s)]
*  A cut and dry First Amendment free speech issue. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  Beyond beyond even the pale of a First Amendment and also just sort of it just extraordinarily [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=54.6s)]
*  reprehensible. But understand that this is just a you know a proof of concept essentially [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=65.56s)]
*  situation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=77.52s)]
*  Here is folks just yesterday in Foley Square, Manhattan. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  This is just sort of blocks from where a lot of the stuff happened was a Cotty. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=85.28s)]
*  Of course, it's downtown and near the courthouse. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=89.6s)]
*  And here are protesters protesting the deportation. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  And this guy was on the negotiating committee with Columbia University. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Dropsite News who have been doing and Premtalker their phenomenal reporting about these issues [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  reported that just a day before he was disappeared by ICE he had written to Columbia to ask [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  for help because he was fearful that the Trump administration was targeting him. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=119.44s)]
*  And just what's a line. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  What they're saying is a line with Hamas is calling for Columbia to divest from Israel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And we should just say Premtalker is with Zateo. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=129.6s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=133.24s)]
*  And Thacker over at. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=134.96s)]
*  Both doing great work. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  But I think Zateo broke the story that I just mentioned. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=139.0s)]
*  Apologies. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=141.68s)]
*  Here is Dropsite. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=143.16000000000003s)]
*  Here is clips of the protests. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=144.24s)]
*  We want justice, you say how? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=148.72s)]
*  We want justice, you say how? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  ICE off our campus now. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  ICE off our campus now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=155.84s)]
*  We want justice, you say how? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  We want justice, you say how? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  ICE off our campus now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=163.0s)]
*  ICE off our campus now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=165.28s)]
*  We want justice, you say how? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=172.72s)]
*  The schools, the sewage and water treatment plants have been completely destroyed by Israel [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=173.72s)]
*  with United States weapons. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=179.32s)]
*  Even after a ceasefire has been reached, Israel continues its genocide on the Palestinian sub-reserve. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=183.83999999999997s)]
*  Just these past weeks and in a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement, international [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=190.44s)]
*  law and all principles of justice and humanity. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=195.92s)]
*  Yeah. So good on folks coming out there. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=201.48s)]
*  And I don't really want to hear much from liberals who are saying that where are all [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=207.28s)]
*  the Palestinian advocates under Donald Trump? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=212.36s)]
*  Well, there they are. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=215.68s)]
*  Check your DSA. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=216.4s)]
*  There's one I know in St. Louis on Wednesday. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=217.8s)]
*  I'm sure there's a lot going up in your communities. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=220.08s)]
*  In the meantime. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=223.0s)]
*  And this is scary stuff because CNN had Bruce Blakeman and he is the Nassau County [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=226.4s)]
*  executive. He's the one who was for, I can't even remember his name now, the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=235.56s)]
*  congressman from who just left. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=245.84s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=250.04s)]
*  Well, this is Swazis district. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=251.72s)]
*  Oh, oh, you're thinking of George Santos. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=253.12s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=257.08s)]
*  I'm the guy who supported George Santos because Santos was apparently so Jewish and then [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=257.76s)]
*  turned out to actually not be anything Jewish. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=262.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=265.04s)]
*  He was just making a joke. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=266.36s)]
*  But this is so this guy has a this guy has a crack team that really does amazing analysis, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=267.44s)]
*  right? Like, I mean, they didn't pick up on Santos right away. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=274.48s)]
*  And so maybe he went out and said, you know, what we need is some type of Intel division. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=279.6s)]
*  Over on Long Island. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=285.88s)]
*  I think the question here is about whether speech can result in people's legal rights. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  He's a virulent anti-Semite. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=294.8s)]
*  He came here on a student visa. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=297.0s)]
*  He's paid by a terrorist organization. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=299.56s)]
*  Now, listen, there's a couple of things that I just want to add. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=303.16s)]
*  He may have come here on a student visa. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=307.52s)]
*  He has a green card. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=309.2s)]
*  He's a permanent resident now. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=310.8s)]
*  Legal immigrant. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=312.4s)]
*  Legal immigrant, permanent resident. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=313.68s)]
*  You're a legal immigrant if you come on a student visa, but you're a permanent resident [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=316.32s)]
*  if you have a green card. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=320.12s)]
*  And I would just say if you're really worried about anti-Semitism, I would suggest if you [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=321.8s)]
*  really want to find some search on Twitter, Sam Cedar Jew, and you will find a lot of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=328.16s)]
*  anti-Semitism in the wake of that Jubilee video. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  But that's just reminding you of your of your identity. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=339.8s)]
*  I don't know why you're so hung up on this. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=342.72s)]
*  Go ahead. On a student visa, he's paid by a terrorist organization. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=344.48s)]
*  Excuse me. That is evidence. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=351.12s)]
*  You have a baby. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  I have I have evidence. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=354.56s)]
*  So I'm sorry, just to be clear, you're alleging that he's paid by. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=355.64s)]
*  He's a paid protester. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=359.84s)]
*  By who? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=361.32s)]
*  Well, I didn't ask my intelligence division exactly who paid for him. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=362.76s)]
*  But wait a second. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=367.24s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=369.8s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  So first, he says he's paid. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=373.2s)]
*  He's paid by a terrorist organization. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=377.12s)]
*  And he just expects that to just go fly. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=378.2s)]
*  And he goes and he has a an Intel division. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=382.36s)]
*  Is that what he said? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=386.32s)]
*  Over in Nassau County, Long Island, Staten Island, CIA. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, no, no, that's not even Staten Island. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  This is even more upper crusty Long Island people. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=393.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=396.52s)]
*  Like the the over in Mineola, they're really looking into the international politics there. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=396.84s)]
*  It's like MI6 over there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=404.56s)]
*  Let's do a let's do a little role play for a second. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=406.76s)]
*  You be the Intel division. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=411.96s)]
*  OK, and I will be this Joker Blakeman. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=413.56s)]
*  Is this protester paid? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=419.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=423.15999999999997s)]
*  Don't say anything else. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=424.44s)]
*  I got to go to CNN. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=426.84s)]
*  I don't want to follow up on this. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=427.8s)]
*  I've got to go to CNN. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=428.76s)]
*  Don't don't say anything else. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=430.24s)]
*  I have no more questions for you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=432.56s)]
*  That's it. Great job. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=434.36s)]
*  You have been excellent. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=435.68s)]
*  Yes, he didn't expect to like the follow up from the entire panel. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=437.4s)]
*  Shout out to our friend Van Latham, who's on the panel there. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=440.76s)]
*  Abby Philip does not let this go. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  So credit to her. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=444.52s)]

*  This is amazing. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=447.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=448.88s)]
*  It's a Long Island CIA. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=449.12s)]
*  Yeah. Go ahead. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=450.44s)]
*  So I'm sorry, just just to be clear, you're alleging that he's paid by. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=452.03999999999996s)]
*  He's a paid protester. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=456.24s)]
*  By who? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, I didn't ask my intelligence division exactly who paid for him. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=459.12s)]
*  But he's being paid by. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=463.64s)]
*  That's a pretty explosive allegation. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=465.32s)]
*  Who is he being paid by? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=469.12s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  Who is he being paid by? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=473.28s)]
*  He's being paid by organizations that are anti-American, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=475.48s)]
*  that are engaged in nefarious activities. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=480.03999999999996s)]
*  Who are nefarious? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't ask my intelligence division to give me. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=484.2s)]
*  Don't come on national TV. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=486.68s)]
*  You know who he's being paid by? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=489.44s)]
*  I don't. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=491.64s)]
*  Are you OK with what he's doing? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=492.32s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=494.92s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=495.92s)]
*  We got to go back. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  What's fascinating is he will ask what their face in the bar. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=498.08s)]
*  And a borrow. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=502.0s)]
*  He'll ask Anna Navarro who he's being paid by. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=502.64s)]
*  But he won't ask his own Intel division who he's being paid by. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=505.32s)]
*  You know, the guys in Massapicua, they're really covert. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=510.0s)]
*  They're going to give me a little bit of the drip, drip, drip. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=514.12s)]
*  But we don't get all the information here. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=516.28s)]
*  I mean, this is the only this is the central claim he was asked [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=518.28s)]
*  to come on television to make. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=521.04s)]
*  And he didn't have that answer. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=523.52s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=525.4s)]
*  But he does have he does seem to know some things about it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=526.24s)]
*  So let's revise our little our little role play. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=529.4000000000001s)]
*  OK, again, I'll be Blakeman. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=533.76s)]
*  OK, you be my Intel division. OK. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  Is he paid? Yes. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=540.72s)]
*  OK, I want you to cough once [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=543.0400000000001s)]
*  if it's an anti-American organization. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=547.36s)]
*  I don't actually don't tell me anything. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=550.72s)]
*  I'm just going to wing it. Go ahead. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=552.8000000000001s)]
*  Don't come on national TV and say I'm going to come on national TV. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=555.2s)]
*  No, he's being paid by. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=559.4000000000001s)]
*  I don't. And I'm not alleging that he's being paid. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=560.6s)]
*  Are you OK with what he's doing? I'm not alleging he's being paid. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=563.0s)]

*  No, I'm not. Are you OK with hate speech? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=571.76s)]
*  Don't make this about that. Make it about the fact that you know. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=573.48s)]
*  That's exactly what it's about. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=575.9200000000001s)]
*  You talk louder doesn't mean anything. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=576.96s)]
*  You're making this about you are saying things on national TV [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=578.76s)]
*  that you cannot corroborate, that is irresponsible. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=581.88s)]
*  And you should not comment on the CIA platform. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=584.44s)]
*  Well, let the FBI and the CIA speak to them. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=587.5600000000001s)]
*  They know exactly what's going on. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=590.8800000000001s)]
*  If there's evidence, bring it out. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=592.2800000000001s)]
*  Hold on. I'm going to ask one more time. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=594.12s)]
*  Do you know for a fact that he is being paid by another entity, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=595.96s)]
*  especially a terrorist organization, can you state that as a fact? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=600.84s)]
*  I can state with the fact that he's being paid as the other professional [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=604.72s)]
*  protesters are being paid by anti-American organizations [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=608.96s)]
*  that are engaged in nefarious activities. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=612.6s)]
*  That allegation. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=614.88s)]
*  I can confirm. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=615.9200000000001s)]
*  So so Bruce, I'm just going to say it right here. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=617.0s)]
*  You you've just made that claim. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=619.6s)]
*  There's no evidence that I know of. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=621.32s)]
*  There's no evidence that you've provided. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=623.0s)]
*  Well, he can sue me that and and I mean, hey, he's free to do whatever he wants. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  But the United States government has not made that allegation. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=629.8000000000001s)]
*  They have not made charges against him on that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=633.2s)]
*  Of course, they made that allegation. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=635.88s)]
*  That's why you speak. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=637.36s)]
*  No, they have. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=638.36s)]
*  So this is so this is the chilling effect of. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  There's people should watch for the rest of because Van was on there. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=643.52s)]
*  And that's great that he's getting more media attention. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=647.04s)]
*  But like, I mean, they all push back. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=649.1999999999999s)]
*  I do think that this is such a flagrant violation of our constitution [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=653.16s)]
*  that even, you know, Anna Navarro was a Republican like a few years ago. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=658.12s)]
*  She's still making this case like she probably still is. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=663.16s)]
*  But can we just pull up? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=667.16s)]
*  All right. One thing I want to just add here. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=668.68s)]
*  The reason why this guy has to lie about this [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=670.8s)]
*  is because on its face, what's happening is so corrupt, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=674.56s)]
*  so unconstitutional that they have to lie to say that he's somehow now an agent. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=679.0s)]
*  Right. Of some type of nefarious terrorist, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=684.92s)]
*  anti-American organization, which, of course, if he was [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=689.56s)]
*  the US government could charge him with that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=693.96s)]
*  It's not like, oh, my, I haven't authorized him on the speech. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=696.3199999999999s)]
*  I haven't. I haven't authorized the Suffolk County [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=700.4s)]
*  Intel division to share with the United States Intel. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=703.52s)]
*  We've got our sources of methods over here. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=707.76s)]
*  We're trying to protect. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=709.76s)]
*  What am I running on some type of freebie thing? No. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=711.8s)]
*  Their interrogation methods include playing Billy Joel over and over again [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=715.36s)]
*  for their subjects or something like that. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=719.88s)]
*  I don't know why he's neither confirmed nor denied. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=721.36s)]
*  But then he later moved on. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=724.16s)]
*  But also, here's the other thing. Yeah. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=725.56s)]
*  What if he was being paid by [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=728.4000000000001s)]
*  and some entity to protest? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=732.08s)]
*  Like, where's the legality in this? Right. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=737.48s)]
*  Where's the I mean, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=742.5200000000001s)]
*  what's his face? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=745.0400000000001s)]
*  Blakeman is on there. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=745.96s)]
*  Presumably he gets paid to be a how about a Republican operative? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=747.12s)]
*  How about the Zionist protests at UCLA who were paid by Jerry Seinfeld's wife? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=751.36s)]
*  They were paid to go out there and harass [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=756.96s)]
*  and sometimes physically intimidate pro-Palestine encampments out there. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=759.52s)]
*  But like why I found this video so fascinating is because [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=763.16s)]
*  I we've covered this before, and it's not getting enough attention [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=767.96s)]
*  that Nassau County, which is a part of Long Island. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=771.44s)]
*  That's why we're making all these long island jokes. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=773.92s)]
*  It's a really well. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=775.72s)]
*  It's the wealthiest part of Long Island, that North Shore area. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=776.68s)]
*  They banned they were the first, not a red state, not Oklahoma. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=781.12s)]
*  Not Alabama. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=786.24s)]
*  They were the first to ban mask for the explicit reason of protests last year. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=788.12s)]
*  And if you could just scroll down to the initial body of this paragraph, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=793.0s)]
*  suburban New York officials looking to stop violent protesters [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=796.2s)]
*  from obscuring their identities have banned wearing masks in public [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=799.0s)]
*  except for health or religious reasons. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=802.2s)]
*  And there we see our friend again, Nassau County Executive [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=804.44s)]
*  Bruce Blakeman, a Republican, signed the legislation Wednesday, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=808.32s)]
*  calling in a bill that protects the public. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=811.68s)]
*  And so then flash forward to this forward article. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=814.44s)]
*  This reporter at the magazine forward [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=820.0400000000001s)]
*  spoke to the people who targeted [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=823.5600000000001s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil for ICE [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=828.7600000000001s)]

*  Barnard is a part of Columbia. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=839.48s)]

*  shortly after the Barnard Library protests concluded last Wednesday. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=857.52s)]
*  Documenting Jew hatred on campus, a group focused on Columbia, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=860.5600000000001s)]

*  wrote to Columbia University and said, I need protection [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=907.2800000000001s)]

*  who broke the news that he asked Columbia for protection. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp7ID3rJ-Bs&t=944.88s)]
