Video Description: CORRECTION: In this breaking news clip about Trump’s defiance of SCOTUS, Emma mistakenly said that CECOT was a solitary confinement prison… It’s not, but it is used as a tactic.

# Trump Openly Defies 9-0 Supreme Court Decision, Promises US Citizens Will Be Sent To Gulag
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ)
*  Donald Trump meeting with El Salvador's far-right dictator President Bukele in the White House now, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=0.0s)]
*  and here they are openly talking about sending quote, home-growns, aka American citizens, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=7.44s)]
*  to the prison camp in El Salvador. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=14.88s)]
*  Home-grown criminals. Home-growns are next. You gotta build about five more places. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=30.0s)]
*  Go back just a second. Yeah, we're getting this as we... [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  So, but here you hear Trump then exclaim more loudly, home-growns are next. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=42.88s)]
*  Home-growns are next. Home-growns are next. You gotta build about five more places. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=48.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=54.96s)]
*  All right. It's not big enough. Oh, yeah, come on. So this is a much different office than you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=56.08s)]
*  Oh my God, then he's going on about the decor in the White House again. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  So it's a much different place. We put up a lot of gold. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=70.96s)]
*  I know that we all know that this man is an insane person. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=76.64s)]
*  Has... [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=81.28s)]
*  Everyone laughed in that room. It's not just Trump. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=81.84s)]
*  No, I mean, look at who the crowd is. Stephen Miller and Rubio and like, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=84.0s)]
*  all they have are News Nation and Fox News reporters, if that, in there at this point. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=91.44s)]
*  I mean, yes, there's complicity in the media on this front, but they're also just like [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=97.52s)]
*  not letting traditional media in the room to ask these kinds of questions. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=101.6s)]
*  Here's another part of this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=105.92s)]
*  Them talking about Kilmar Abrego-Garcia because the Supreme Court has said now [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=110.56s)]
*  that the Trump administration must facilitate his return. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  Trump is now saying basically he's going to defy that, testing the Supreme Court, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=121.2s)]
*  which we knew was going to happen because they don't have an enforcement mechanism. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=126.56s)]
*  And that's why they said things like facilitate and use more conservative language than [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=130.72s)]
*  they would, I think, if they were like had the authority over or if they hadn't maybe said that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=135.67999999999998s)]
*  the president is immune from prosecution for official acts. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  Perhaps they'd feel a little bit more emboldened to tell him what to do and what not to do. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=147.28s)]
*  But this is their own making here. Bukele just basically saying, I'm not going to help send him back. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=151.2s)]
*  Can President Bukele weigh in on this? Do you plan to return him? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=158.48s)]
*  Well, I guess. I'm supposed to have suggested that I'll smuggle a terrorist into the United States, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=162.88s)]
*  They totally shamed that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=167.92s)]
*  How can I return him to the United States? Like, I smuggle him into the United States? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=169.92s)]
*  Calling him a terrorist. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=175.92s)]
*  Of course, I'm not going to do it. It's like, I mean, the question is for Bostridge. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=176.42s)]
*  How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don't know. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=181.92s)]
*  I don't have the power to return him to the United States. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  But you can release him inside of this level of... [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm not releasing... I mean, we're not very fond of releasing terrorists into our country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  We just turned the murder capital of the world into the safest country in the Western Hemisphere. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  And he wants to go back into releasing criminals so we can go back to being the murder capital of the world. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=205.27999999999997s)]
*  Well, they'd love to have a criminal released into the world. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=207.27999999999997s)]
*  That's a fascination. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=211.27999999999997s)]
*  These are sick people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, who's that reporter? One of the only... [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  Only... [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  Collins. It's Kaitlyn Collins. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=221.64s)]
*  That's the White House correspondent for CNN, it seems like. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=223.64s)]
*  I mean, so CICOT, which is the maximum security prison in El Salvador that Trump says we now need many more of, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=227.64s)]
*  is a gulag. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=238.0s)]
*  It's basically a prison that you don't talk to anybody. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=240.0s)]
*  It's solitary confinement for almost every part of the day, 23 hours a day, which is torture. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=245.0s)]
*  Psychological torture that has effects on prisoners' brains and is not helpful to reintegrate people back into society. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=251.0s)]
*  It makes people go insane. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=261.0s)]
*  But that's the point. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=263.36s)]
*  And that's maybe the least horrible thing that happens to these folks in this prison. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=265.36s)]
*  The way you get into CICOT is if Bukele says you get into CICOT, because he's a dictator, a far-right dictator, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=270.36s)]
*  who decides who gets thrown in a prison camp and who doesn't. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=278.36s)]
*  And Donald Trump empties that authority and is now talking about doing that to American citizens. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=282.36s)]
*  We have had so many constitutional crises under this administration already, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=288.72s)]
*  and it's been like three months since he got into office. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=294.72s)]
*  But this might be the most intense, and that's saying a lot, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=298.72s)]
*  because this is an absolutely fundamental right in this country, the right to due process. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=302.72s)]
*  And the Trump administration is, well, habeas corpus. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=309.72s)]
*  This is their war on habeas corpus. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=314.72s)]
*  Basically saying that Trump thinks that he can deport anybody that he deems a terrorist [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  to a foreign prison camp without having their day in court. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=327.08000000000004s)]
*  And then when you marry that with what is happening right in front of our eyes [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  with Kimbray Arbrego-Garcia being the example, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  and Trump then saying in the same meeting that he wants to do that to U.S. citizens, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  what else can we glean from this? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  You have Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=346.44s)]
*  Oh, it was just going to be the criminals, we were told, that were deported. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=347.44s)]
*  And then you have the press take that at face value, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=350.44s)]
*  and eventually they get access to some court documents. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=353.44s)]
*  And you have CBS and other outlets reporting. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=356.44s)]
*  It's like anywhere between 75 to 90 percent of these people have zero criminal record, zero. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=360.44s)]
*  And there are right now hundreds in this prison in solitary confinement [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=366.44s)]
*  with their heads shaved and likely being tortured. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=370.44s)]
*  And Trump is saying that he wants to do that to U.S. citizens. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=373.8s)]
*  I mean, obviously incredibly disturbing. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=376.8s)]
*  I mean, the truth is, we don't need to reference previous times or former McCarthyisms. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=384.8s)]
*  We're in one of those periods now that people will cite. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=389.8s)]
*  And the question is, how bad does it get? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=392.8s)]
*  Marco Rubio, which 99 senators voted for, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=395.8s)]
*  including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=401.16s)]
*  And they should maybe be more at the forefront of that vote, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=403.16s)]
*  I think, in maybe repenting for it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=409.16s)]
*  But here's Marco Rubio talking about this, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=412.16s)]
*  who's actually maybe the key diplomat in charge of, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=414.16s)]
*  or key government figure in charge of this besides Trump. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=417.16s)]
*  We're told this guy is the sane one. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=420.16s)]
*  I don't understand what the confusion is. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=424.16s)]
*  This individual is a citizen of El Salvador. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=427.16s)]
*  He was legally in the United States and was returned to his country. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=430.52000000000004s)]
*  That's where you deport people, back to their country of origin. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=433.52000000000004s)]
*  Except for Venezuela that wasn't refusing to take people back or places like that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=436.52000000000004s)]
*  I can tell you this, Mr. President. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=439.52000000000004s)]
*  No, the foreign policy of the United States is conducted by the President of the United States, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  not by a court. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  And no court in the United States has a right to conduct a foreign policy of the United States. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=446.52000000000004s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  End of story. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=452.52000000000004s)]
*  OK, so there's a few different sleights of hand there. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  Is he a terrorist or can he be... [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=456.88s)]
*  Can Kilmar Obregogorosia be released back into El Salvador? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=458.88s)]
*  That's very different than what Bukele and Trump just said there. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=462.88s)]
*  They called him a terrorist, even though he's not one. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=465.88s)]
*  He's never been criminally charged. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=468.88s)]
*  He was fingered by a confidential informant. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=470.88s)]
*  And that tip went nowhere. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=473.88s)]
*  And that is the extent of any history that he has with the law outside of, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=475.88s)]
*  you know, trying to become a citizen and being a part of a union [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=480.88s)]
*  and working as an apprentice here in the Maryland area. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=485.24s)]
*  He is a husband. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=488.24s)]
*  He is a father. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=489.24s)]
*  He is not a terrorist. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=491.24s)]
*  That's already been delineated. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=492.24s)]
*  The Trump administration admitted that they made a mistake. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=495.24s)]
*  They admitted that they made a mistake sending him there. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=498.24s)]
*  Then you have... [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=501.24s)]
*  They're basically prison, private prison contractor in chief. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=502.24s)]
*  Bukele is saying that I'm not going to release him because there's nothing I can do, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=508.24s)]
*  sneering at the rest of the press. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=511.24s)]
*  But then you turn to Rubio saying, well, maybe he can get released back into El Salvador [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=513.6s)]
*  because that's where he's from. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=516.6s)]
*  Which one is it? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=519.6s)]
*  Which one is it? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=521.6s)]
*  Abrego Garcia married his girlfriend June 2019. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=522.6s)]
*  They had a child together that was who was a U.S. citizen. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=525.6s)]
*  Wife also had two children from an earlier relationship [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=528.6s)]
*  and all three children have special needs. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=530.6s)]
*  Abrego Garcia fought allegations against him in deputation proceedings in court [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=532.6s)]
*  and applied for asylum. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=536.6s)]
*  His request was denied. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=537.6s)]
*  However, Judge Granary withholding of removal status [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=539.6s)]
*  that would block his deportation to El Salvador due to the threat that gangs would pose to him. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=541.96s)]
*  He wasn't a gang member. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=547.96s)]
*  He's a threat posed to the gang. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=548.96s)]
*  Fleeing gangs. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=549.96s)]
*  He was more likely to be harmed if he was returned to El Salvador, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=550.96s)]
*  which of course is the reality that he's going to live out. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=553.96s)]
*  All that is to say, of course, he is the ideal candidate for sympathy. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=557.96s)]
*  But the truth is, if we can't bring somebody back that we send there, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=561.96s)]
*  we shouldn't be sending anywhere in there at all, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=566.96s)]
*  even if it's Hannibal, the late great Hannibal Lecter, as Donald Trump likes to say. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=569.32s)]
*  It's a fucking joke. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=573.32s)]
*  It's a it's this is a fascist takeover of or a fascist advance. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=575.32s)]
*  I should say takeover is probably too generous to the United States. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=579.32s)]
*  Fascist advance of this country. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=582.32s)]
*  And, you know, there's certain people in our field that were taking, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=584.32s)]
*  like you said, the claim that this was just going to be criminals at face value [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=588.32s)]
*  at the beginning of this administration and also putting air quotes around words like Gulag [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=592.32s)]
*  or minimizing, say, like what it was, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=598.6800000000001s)]
*  what it meant that we are going to send more people to Guantanamo. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=600.6800000000001s)]
*  These are Gulags. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  Trump said more just on camera, more of them in for US citizens. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  And we were told we were hyperventilating. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=609.6800000000001s)]
*  You absolutely like complete vicious liars. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=614.6800000000001s)]
*  And then I like just and how obvious did it have to be? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=616.6800000000001s)]
*  How how much did he have to just say it? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  It's the same thing. He's been saying tariffs. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=623.6800000000001s)]
*  He's been saying mass deportations. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=626.04s)]
*  He's been calling these people criminals baselessly. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=629.04s)]
*  And then you add Rubio. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=631.04s)]
*  That's the other side of hand there. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=633.04s)]
*  Foreign policy. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=635.04s)]
*  How is this foreign policy when you're deporting people from US soil [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=637.04s)]
*  who were here and going through the process, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=640.04s)]
*  including that temporary removal blockage that that that that matches described there. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=642.04s)]
*  These are people that were going through the legal process, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=649.04s)]
*  including those folks that apply for Social Security numbers, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=652.4s)]
*  because they hope that one day they can build up this equity [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=655.4s)]
*  so they can become full US citizens as they pay billions of dollars [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=658.4s)]
*  into our social programs and don't get anything out of it in many instances. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=662.4s)]
*  Like, it's the reverse of what they describe. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=666.4s)]
*  So it's not foreign policy. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=669.4s)]
*  This isn't about our relations with the Middle East or with China or whatever. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=672.4s)]
*  These are people who are here in the United States on US soil. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=679.76s)]
*  But when you say foreign policy, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=682.76s)]
*  because we are you can't understand the moment that we're in [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=685.76s)]
*  without understanding the war on terror and our erosion of rights [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=690.76s)]
*  and the fact that, frankly, Democrats did not effectively rebuild [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=693.76s)]
*  the guardrails that were destroyed by the Bush administration [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=698.76s)]
*  under the guise of national security and foreign policy. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=701.76s)]
*  We now have these massive institutions like ICE [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=705.76s)]
*  and the Department of Homeland Security that have this broad authority [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=708.12s)]
*  to bend into fascist, fully fascist organizations [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=711.12s)]
*  that the Trump administration is using unilaterally [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=716.12s)]
*  to crack down on people without due process, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=719.12s)]
*  even in the face of a 9-0 Supreme Court ruling, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=721.12s)]
*  even freaking Clarence Thomas told them this is a bridge too far [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=723.12s)]
*  and Trump is defying it. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=726.12s)]
*  I mean, it's because we have a Nazi foreign policy [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=728.12s)]
*  that includes Stephen Miller, who is really the author of this, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=733.12s)]
*  who was exposed to Nazi, basically, white supremacist [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=737.48s)]
*  in Trump's first term. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=740.48s)]
*  You can Google that, look it up. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=741.48s)]
*  But like a white Cuban like Marco Rubio fits right in with that agenda, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=743.48s)]
*  frankly, particularly our entire history of suppressing any kind of movements [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=748.48s)]
*  and partnering with reactionaries like Bukele, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=753.48s)]
*  dictatorial reactionaries. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=756.48s)]
*  This is America. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=759.48s)]
*  Can I say, regardless of whether, you know, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=761.84s)]
*  putting aside the actions of the US government, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=766.84s)]
*  putting aside the actions of the Salvadoran government, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=768.84s)]
*  individuals, regardless of where they're from in the world, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=771.84s)]
*  have human rights. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=774.84s)]
*  It's sort of the basis of what had been the established post-war order. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=775.84s)]
*  The concept, right? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=782.84s)]
*  The concept of human rights. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=784.84s)]
*  And what the US officials and Salvadoran officials have insinuated [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=786.84s)]
*  is that those people who are in that gulag [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=791.2s)]
*  will be there for the rest of their lives. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=793.2s)]
*  And say what you, I mean, obviously what happened in Guantanamo Bay [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=796.2s)]
*  was an abomination and a perpetual human rights abuse [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=800.2s)]
*  that continues to this day. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=804.2s)]
*  But at the very least, the US, the Pentagon felt some pressure [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=805.2s)]
*  to have some sort of trial. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=810.2s)]
*  Not everyone, actually. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=813.2s)]
*  There's people who are being held there who are not charged with anything. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=814.2s)]
*  But for the most part, they felt some sort of pressure to either charge people [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=818.5600000000001s)]
*  and have at least a show trial, like at least some sort of kangaroo court. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  But in this case... [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=826.5600000000001s)]
*  The Supreme Court told them they had to. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=827.5600000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=829.5600000000001s)]
*  But in this case, these people are being sent to El Salvador [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=830.5600000000001s)]
*  for the rest of their lives [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=833.5600000000001s)]
*  without having so much as been charged with a crime. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=835.5600000000001s)]
*  Regardless of where they're from and who's doing it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  And gang ties, as we've gone through in this interview, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=841.5600000000001s)]
*  or in our past interviews and with Roberto today, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=845.92s)]
*  are very flimsy and are often used by local police departments [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=849.92s)]
*  to have large scale databases on poor men in cities. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=854.92s)]
*  And again, like broadly, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=861.92s)]
*  even if somebody like was affiliated with a gang in the teenage years or whatever, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=863.92s)]
*  like you, the way to deal with that is it cannot be to send them to a gulag [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=868.92s)]
*  with no recourse, with no due process. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=874.28s)]
*  It's obviously dealing with gangs, like gang is a symptom. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=877.28s)]
*  Yep. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=881.28s)]
*  With that said, Matt, what's happening on Left Reckoning? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=883.28s)]
*  Probably talking to some Colorado jerk polis with a guest, Grace, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=887.28s)]
*  tomorrow on Left Reckoning. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=892.28s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, broadly freaking out about all this stuff. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVIvQwRzTdQ&t=894.28s)]
