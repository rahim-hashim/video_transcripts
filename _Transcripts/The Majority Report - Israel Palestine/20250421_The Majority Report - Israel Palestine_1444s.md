New chairman of the House Progressive Caucus Rep. Greg Casar (D-TX) shares his vision for how the Democratic Party can push back on Trump’s draconian immigration crackdown, as well as providing a more positive vision for a forward-looking immigration program of their own. Emma also asks Casar about what conversations are taking place within the House Progressive Caucus about the disconnection between the Democratic Party at large and its constituents on Gaza. Casar also talks about his experience on the Fight the Oligarchy tour with Bernie & AOC, and his desire to make sure the federal government is rid of Elon Musk by May.

# Dems Must Stop Playing Defense | Rep. Greg Casar | TMR
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY)
*  We are back and we are joined now by Representative Greg Kassar, Congressman representing Texas's 35th [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=0.0s)]
*  District and also Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Representative Kassar, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  thanks so much for coming on the show today. Yeah, thanks for having me on. I'm looking forward to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=11.36s)]
*  talking with you and folks at home. Absolutely. Let's start here because it's the biggest story [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  of the day. Senator Chris Van Hollen was able to speak with Kilmar Abrego Garcia and see him in [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=21.52s)]
*  person. There was proof of life. There were some concerns that he may not even be alive because [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=29.2s)]
*  this prison is very notorious for its abuses and sometimes people die there. What was your reaction [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=34.08s)]
*  to this fairly successful mission by Senator Van Hollen going to find his constituent down in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=42.08s)]
*  El Salvador? Well, first I'm so grateful for Senator Van Hollen's leadership and also so grateful [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=49.28s)]
*  that Mr. Abrego Garcia is alive and I think this really shows how the Trump administration does not [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=56.0s)]
*  have to always be on the front foot on everything and how when democratic leadership and people in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=64.56s)]
*  elected office listen to our constituents and stand up and really fight back that we can put [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=72.08s)]
*  the worst authoritarians on the planet like Bukele on the back foot, that we can put the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=78.88s)]
*  Trump administration on the back foot, that we can save lives and that we can make some of these [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=83.92s)]
*  abuses and horrors a real national story because I feel like we're getting hit day in and day out [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=89.28s)]
*  by these constitutional abuses taking away people's basic rights and folks at home want to know is [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=95.92s)]
*  there anything I can do about this? I think speaking up and encouraging your leaders, folks [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=102.56s)]
*  like Senator Van Hollen, to stick up and fight. I think we could see how we could start to turn the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=108.48s)]
*  tide because they didn't just let Senator Van Hollen meet with Kilmer Garcia because they wanted [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=113.68s)]
*  to. It's because I think they had a sense that they had to because the public was starting to get [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  the sense that the president of the United States is talking about sending just anybody to a prison [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=126.64000000000001s)]
*  camp outside of American law in El Salvador and that is not popular in this country and I think [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  folks really speaking out really start to make a difference so we and we need to be getting back on [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=138.8s)]
*  the front foot even on issues like immigration where the Trump administration is going so far [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=143.36s)]
*  outside the law and being so abusive of people's baseline constitutional rights. This isn't about [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  public safety. What the president is doing is about taking away the baseline rights of every [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=152.8s)]
*  single American immigrants or not. I'm glad you say that about the popularity of because on [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=158.0s)]
*  the surface, Donald Trump's best issue when it comes to polling is immigration but I've been [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  frustrated by some conversations I hear in liberal circles where there's this tendency for [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=172.48s)]
*  some reason to respond to polling as if it is static and unchangeable as if Democrats can't [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=178.64s)]
*  message in a way that changes the conversation around immigration. I grew up in the suburbs of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=185.28s)]
*  New York City going to Ellis Island and being told by my teachers how immigration built this country [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  and how important it is to have immigration. Is there beginning to be a consensus within the party [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=196.72s)]
*  that this is the kind of thing that they can positively message around how immigration makes [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=204.08s)]
*  us stronger? We can't always play defense. Otherwise, the Republicans just fill the vacuum [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=209.12s)]
*  and fill the void with their own propaganda and they continue to move the polling in their direction. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=216.0s)]
*  Look, immigration issues did not pull great when Trump first was elected into office, but then [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=222.32s)]
*  when we started pointing out that he was putting kids in cages and deporting innocent families and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=229.44s)]
*  taking our limited law enforcement resources away from gun traffickers and cartels and pointing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=235.6s)]
*  it instead at innocent workers, then the numbers shifted. And us actually being a pro-immigrant [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=241.2s)]
*  party that also cared about law and order and a good economy and being pro-immigrant, that actually [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=248.72s)]
*  helped us take back the house during the first Trump administration. So I do think it's time for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=255.92s)]
*  us to get off the back foot and start pointing out just how nuts it is that this guy wants to take [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=260.64s)]
*  away birthright citizenship that allows so many of us to be Americans when we were born and raised [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=266.32s)]
*  here rather than citizens of some other country that we've never known. It's so nuts that he's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=272.56s)]
*  talking about sending Americans to prisons in El Salvador where you can't contact a lawyer, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=277.92s)]
*  where a U.S. senator has to come find out if you're even alive. And so look, as somebody that has [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  been working in the labor rights world and as a labor organizer in the past and in immigrants [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=290.16s)]
*  rights, I think we do have lessons to learn from eight years ago that organizing and getting on [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  the front foot and get on offense works, but we also need to remember that we need to connect [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  our pro-immigrant message to the vast majority of the American people. This is the last thing I'll [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=303.44s)]
*  mention on this point, Emma. Back when I was a labor organizer here in Texas, before I was an [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=308.56s)]
*  elected official, we'd organize on construction sites where you had lots of citizens and non-citizens [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=313.52s)]
*  all on the site and you wanted to organize folks into unions to push back to raise wages for [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=318.48s)]
*  everyone. And instead of just saying immigrant rights or human rights, which of course they are, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=323.12s)]
*  but instead of just going with that message, we would talk about how these big money interests [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=327.84s)]
*  wanted there to be two different classes of people. That if they could scare people and say [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=334.56s)]
*  a certain group of folks, immigrants, have less rights than citizens, then it was easier for them [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  to work some folks overtime without ever having to pay them their overtime wages. They could push [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=345.44s)]
*  down wages for everyone. And so I think we need to get back to a place where we say these immigrant [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=350.79999999999995s)]
*  rights and the equal rights of everybody, that actually defends your rights as a citizen, that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=356.48s)]
*  defends your rights as a worker. And I think the democratic and progressive message needs to get [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=361.36s)]
*  on the front foot, but also remain inclusive in that kind of bigger tent way. Is that your experience [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=366.16s)]
*  as a labor organizer that some folks who maybe were here under, were undocumented or weren't [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  full citizens as workers, that the threat of deportation or immigration enforcement was often [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=379.12s)]
*  used by their employers to perhaps strong arm them into maybe more unsafe conditions or lower [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=385.28s)]
*  wages? Because that seems to be the under discussed element of immigration enforcement is that if [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=391.35999999999996s)]
*  you're somebody who wants to unionize or maybe has experienced harassment in your workplace, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=397.52s)]
*  you're going to be a lot less likely to speak up if you're fearful that ICE is going to come [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  and take you away from your family. This happens all the time, every single day, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=408.08s)]
*  in every major city and town in this country. I cannot tell you how often we had folks come in [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=414.0s)]
*  from the restaurant industry, from the service industry, from the construction industry, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=421.36s)]
*  not only who are being underpaid and could be threatened with deportation if they spoke up, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=425.12s)]
*  but folks that would work two weeks or a month and then not be paid anything at all. We don't talk [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=430.4s)]
*  enough about how wage theft is one of the greatest forms of theft in this entire country. And what I [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=437.44s)]
*  think we need to do if we want to be a populist and economic party based party again as Democrats, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=443.76s)]
*  but also a pro-immigrant party, is that everybody's wages will go up if we make sure that people are [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=449.12s)]
*  all in the same playing field and that immigrant workers have the same rights to speak up as [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=457.2s)]
*  everybody else and don't have the threat of deportation hanging over them. That we're going [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=461.76s)]
*  to have more unions for everybody if immigrant workers can feel just as comfortable signing that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  union card as a U.S. citizen worker. So this isn't just a human rights issue, this is an economic [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=471.84s)]
*  rights issue for every single American. And on the immigration agenda, can the Democrats get behind [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=478.47999999999996s)]
*  the agenda that you're describing, an affirmative immigration agenda, not just the Congressional [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  Progressive Caucus, not just running on some little trick that the Biden administration did with, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=492.4s)]
*  oh, we put this very right-wing border bill up in the Senate and the Democrats or the Republicans [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=500.4s)]
*  killed it because Trump didn't want to hand us a win. This procedural cute point was, I mean, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=505.2s)]
*  I think one of the worst strategic moves of the campaign in 2024 because you're just hitting the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=512.88s)]
*  Republicans on their hypocrisy and you're not saying what you believe in. Look, voters want [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=519.44s)]
*  an orderly and safe and legal immigration system. And the challenge that we face, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=525.6s)]
*  and this is where I'll be a little bit more empathetic to the Democrats' dilemma here, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=530.72s)]
*  is that people want a system that works, but the Republican Party has essentially become a [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=536.72s)]
*  daily arsonist of the immigration system. And so if you have a party and the Republicans that wants [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=542.88s)]
*  to make the immigration system as ill as possible, as difficult as possible, essentially the cartels [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=548.96s)]
*  couldn't have a better friend than the Republican Party that want to keep immigration as difficult [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=556.72s)]
*  as possible so that they create a black market for immigration. As Democrats, we are seen as [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=561.52s)]
*  responsible for the immigration system that is that we have. And we need to not just blame the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=568.96s)]
*  Republicans for a broken system, but actually have a proposal for what a good legal system would [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=573.76s)]
*  look like. So folks aren't sitting in tents and shelters at the border, but instead can apply [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=578.24s)]
*  legally and come here in a safe, orderly, and legal manner. And to your point, if we don't have that [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=583.52s)]
*  affirmative vision, then we're always going to be stuck into every campaign cycle as we get closer [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=590.4s)]
*  to election going Republican light. And at that point, if the arguments between Republican and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=595.84s)]
*  Republican light, a lot of people are just going to pick the real thing. And to be more specific, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=600.32s)]
*  that means maybe instead of all this money going towards enforcement or policing on the border, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  does that include increase in funding for processing, expanding the pool of resources [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=612.16s)]
*  for immigration courts to allow for folks to be able to come in and then come back to their hearing [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=617.92s)]
*  and have this system make more sense as opposed to it being one based on fear? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=624.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. I mean, there's so much we have to do. First of all, we got to say, look, the folks that [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  have been here for years and years and years, paying taxes, doing their job, look, those folks, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=634.24s)]
*  they're basically US citizens, but for continued inaction in Congress, first of all. Then second [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=640.72s)]
*  of all, we've got to have a way that people can apply to come here because so many people, when [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=646.8s)]
*  we say, well, just wait in line and come here the right way, that system doesn't even exist. It just [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=651.92s)]
*  doesn't exist period. So we've got to create that pathway for people who are fleeing desperation [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=656.88s)]
*  and violence and all these problems across the Western Hemisphere to be able to apply and have [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=663.2s)]
*  a process for coming here legally. Otherwise, you could just dump all of the money in the world [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=667.84s)]
*  on continuing to enforce a broken system. Then the last thing that not enough Democrats talk about, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=673.2800000000001s)]
*  and I'm pretty unorthodox on this even within my own party, is we've got to address the ways [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=679.6s)]
*  that the United States-owned foreign policy drives starvation and deprivation across the world and [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=685.6s)]
*  pushes people to come here that would rather be at home if they could, but for some of the United [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=690.88s)]
*  States-owned policies. Look, I'm not a fan of the Maduro regime in Venezuela in the least bit, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=696.64s)]
*  but we have pursued a policy of starving, innocent people in Venezuela, hoping that Maduro would hold [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=703.76s)]
*  elections when he's not going to hold a free and fair election. Then when a lot of folks from [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=710.64s)]
*  Venezuela show up, we need to ask ourselves, was this the right policy for us to contribute [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=714.32s)]
*  to the very starvation and problems that many of them are fleeing? Of course, many of them are [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=720.4s)]
*  their own government's fault, but they aren't even voting for that government in most cases, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=724.64s)]
*  but why would we go and then punish those people and then let the Republicans weaponize that issue [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=728.3199999999999s)]
*  against us? It's insane and we can't keep doing it. Yeah. Yep. I think that's a great point. You [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=732.72s)]
*  bring up foreign policy, which is obviously a very important and salient topic for a lot of [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=739.68s)]
*  the Democratic base when it comes to what Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have called [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=746.4s)]
*  acts of genocide in Gaza. We had representative Pramila Jayapal on the show in January. She is [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=753.6s)]
*  obviously your predecessor in the Congressional Progressive Caucus. I love that you guys have term [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=763.68s)]
*  limits. That's something just more small-D democratic about the Congressional Progressive [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=769.52s)]
*  Caucus that I appreciate. But this was her answer. And I'm wondering if you have an update on this [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=776.08s)]
*  from January to my question about whether or not the Democratic party has reckoned with how young [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=781.84s)]
*  people may be disillusioned by what they're seeing out of the Gaza Strip. Is the party reckoning with [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=787.6800000000001s)]
*  how the support for the slaughter has potentially damaged the party's brand long-term for an entire [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=795.5200000000001s)]
*  generation of young people and also the voters you describe? My honest answer to you is I don't [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=802.8s)]
*  think that that conversation is happening. I really don't. I think it's been frustrating to me as [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=808.64s)]
*  somebody who shares and has been really vocal on Gaza and been targeted for it by... Yeah, her [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=814.16s)]
*  answer is longer. People can check out that full interview if they'd like, but we have you for a [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  limited time, Representative Kassar. Is there an update to that? Has the Democratic caucus begun, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=830.4s)]
*  in your opinion, to reckon with some of the effects of how people view now this [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=837.4399999999999s)]
*  past administration as a party that supports such brutality when we draw on such a significant [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=845.76s)]
*  contrast, frankly, after the Bush administration waged the illegal war in Iraq? We're back to square [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=851.68s)]
*  one, it seems to me. Yeah, we can't let the Trump administration that is now openly advocating for [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=858.0s)]
*  the complete ethnic cleansing of Gaza continue to then try to message and say that they're going to [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=866.72s)]
*  become the anti-war party within the Republican party. I mean, at that point, that would just be [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=874.0s)]
*  so devastating to us. We have to be and have the Democratic party be the party that is for prosperity [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=879.76s)]
*  of our own people and against violence here and across the world. That, I think, has led to real [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=887.76s)]
*  consequences for so many innocent people in Gaza. But to your question, as far as the Democratic [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=895.6s)]
*  party really reckoning with it, I agree with my prior chair, Pramila Jayapal, that that reckoning [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  has not yet happened. But one place where I hope we can start to have that reckoning in that [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=908.24s)]
*  conversation is with some of these early elections and early primaries that we're going to have, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=915.36s)]
*  because some of the organizations that dump in infinite amounts of money for those candidates [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=921.84s)]
*  that want there to be peace and stability for innocent Palestinians and Israelis alike, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=929.52s)]
*  now we're talking about a situation where the president of the United States is advocating [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=935.92s)]
*  for complete ethnic cleansing of Gaza. And I hope that Democratic primary candidates at least can [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=941.2s)]
*  speak out against that. And we will be having some of those elections upcoming even this year. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=947.84s)]
*  So I urge folks that are watching this here at home to pay attention to some of those early [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  elections and see if we can have the kind of reckoning within our Democratic party that [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=959.2s)]
*  big money should not be determining who wins these primaries and that Democratic candidates [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=964.0s)]
*  can and should do better with the support of our base to be willing to speak out against what went [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=970.08s)]
*  from devastating, horrific choices by the Biden administration to a total ethnic cleansing plan [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=975.5200000000001s)]
*  that we're now facing down with Netanyahu and Trump and Cahoot. Is that a part of what DNC vice [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=983.36s)]
*  chair David Hogg is focusing on? I mean, what is your opinion on that effort to potentially [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=991.6800000000001s)]
*  primary some folks in Congress? I haven't really gotten a chance to know what the real details are [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=998.64s)]
*  of what it is he's working on. What I will tell you is that the Congressional Progressive Caucus [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1005.84s)]
*  does have its own pack. We are not an outside group. And so we're, of course, going to be [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1011.1999999999999s)]
*  different than outside organizations. We participate in open primaries, of which there will be many, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1017.12s)]
*  usually when there's retirements. And then also, for example, there have been the really tragic [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1023.12s)]
*  and early deaths of some of our own Progressive Caucus members. And so in those open seats is [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1027.52s)]
*  where oftentimes you've actually seen the enormous spending and a progressive candidate and oftentimes [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1033.44s)]
*  in a progressive district have to face down a much more centrist or corporate other candidate [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1041.52s)]
*  and where this debate on foreign policy really comes to a head. And so I think you will see that [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1049.84s)]
*  in several of the open seats because of retirement or because we're filling the vacant seat [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1055.68s)]
*  of a member who has passed. And so I think you'll be seeing that coming up here this year. We won't [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1060.16s)]
*  have to be waiting till next year, I think, for some of that. And last question on this topic. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1066.96s)]
*  I just think it's important to really nail this down here. I'm still hearing essentially every [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1072.16s)]
*  Democrat talk about the two state solution as the goal right now. And I just want to be clear that [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1077.44s)]
*  it appears that Israel is attempting to take the entirety of the West Bank and is [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1083.04s)]
*  ethically cleansing the whole Gaza Strip, which in practice would create a one state reality. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1088.72s)]
*  This messaging isn't urgent enough to address what's happening there. Can there be discussions [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1096.16s)]
*  within the Congressional Progressive Caucus or will there be about what a future Israel-Palestine [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1103.8400000000001s)]
*  position looks like? Because we're using talking points from like 20 years ago to talk about the [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1110.24s)]
*  situation there. Yeah, I mean, it's such a look, I'm gonna be honest, it's such a sensitive topic [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1115.6s)]
*  amongst members of Congress. I have, of course, within the Congressional Progressive Caucus, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1123.44s)]
*  nearly 100 members who vote all different sorts of ways on this issue. And what we're trying to [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1128.88s)]
*  bring people together around is how do we stop the killing? How do we, at least in the immediate [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1134.24s)]
*  term, just stop the continued daily death and famine and withholding of aid and human rights abuses [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1140.72s)]
*  in both the West Bank and in Gaza for the good of everyone there? And so I think you're right. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1150.4s)]
*  Talking about this the way we talked about this theoretically years ago, no longer addresses the [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1157.28s)]
*  issue. I have a lot of trouble, I'm going to be honest here to folks watching the show, a lot of [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1163.28s)]
*  trouble talking with that big of a group of people about what the vision is for five or ten years [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  from now. But where I can get folks together is to say it is just devastating what has been going on [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1172.8799999999999s)]
*  and we've got to find a way to make it stop. That the level of death, the conditions for people there [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1180.3999999999999s)]
*  is just unacceptable and it should be unacceptable for anybody of conscience. And so right now, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1184.96s)]
*  I do think that putting aside the talking points that were so 1990s and 2000s does make sense to [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1191.36s)]
*  me. I don't have the best idea for you on this show about where we had five or ten years from now, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1198.24s)]
*  but right now I'm just trying to say, hey, how do we organize to say stop the bombs? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1205.04s)]
*  Right. You've got to look right in front of you as well as long term and have long term and short [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1209.6799999999998s)]
*  term strategy. I totally get that. From a more positive direction on the long term strategy piece, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1216.4s)]
*  this anti-oligarchy tour that you were a part of with AOC and Bernie Sanders seems to be just [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1222.48s)]
*  absolutely picking up incredible steam and you have this mascot of Elon Musk, but really just [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1229.76s)]
*  the multiple Republican billionaires that are in Donald Trump's administration that [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1236.72s)]
*  put characters to the public of what oligarchy looks like, what billionaire capture of our [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1241.2s)]
*  government looks like. Is that a vision that you see going forward for the Democrats as [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1247.6s)]
*  the messaging on kitchen table issues is about how tariffs are affecting the economy and he's so [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1253.52s)]
*  turbulent and causing all of these issues? There's also this other piece of like, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1258.48s)]
*  now we've got to tax the rich and it seems like the base is completely there. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1263.04s)]
*  The base is there and the base is getting bigger on this issue. When I was on the fighting oligarchy [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1267.92s)]
*  tour and went and did the Tucson, Arizona stop with Bernie and AOC, they said, look, we've got [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1275.2s)]
*  the high school gym rented out. It fits about 2000 people. That's pretty good for Tucson. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1281.04s)]
*  We showed up and I thought we were already at the high school. We were five blocks away and that's [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1285.8400000000001s)]
*  how long the line was. 23,000 people didn't fit in the gym, took over the whole football field. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1290.48s)]
*  It was the biggest rally in Arizona history and it's only gotten bigger since then. When I talked [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1297.12s)]
*  to people standing in the line as we were getting ready for the event, there were lots of folks who [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1302.72s)]
*  said, I wasn't with Bernie seven or eight or nine years ago, but damn, I think maybe he was right [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1306.8s)]
*  this entire time because before when he was talking about billionaires running the government behind [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1312.24s)]
*  the curtain, now they're running the cabinet meetings. Now they're, the richest man on earth [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1317.12s)]
*  is bragging about running the government on Twitter every day. And so this is a moment within [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1322.24s)]
*  all of this despair and all the horrible stuff, of course, we have been talking about. There also is [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1328.16s)]
*  an opening for us to transform the democratic party into the kind of party that can excite not [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1333.1200000000001s)]
*  just our base, but bring in disaffected voters and independence folks that might be more socially [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1339.2s)]
*  conservative than you and I on some issues, but say at the end of the day, we need a party that [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1343.76s)]
*  says we shouldn't have the richest guys on earth buying politicians in order to skew their economy [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1348.08s)]
*  in their own favor and screw over everybody else. And that is the kind of message that held together [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1353.6799999999998s)]
*  FDRs coalition. That's the kind of message that held together JFK and LBJs coalition. That's how [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1359.84s)]
*  you build the next new deal. That's how we pass social security and Medicaid and Medicare was by [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1365.28s)]
*  being a party that could hold most of the country together by saying we're for working people. But [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1371.12s)]
*  just as you said, just saying we're for working people, maybe nobody hears that kind of a standard [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1376.56s)]
*  message. We also have to have a villain and show folks who we're willing to fight against. And those [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1381.52s)]
*  villains are very clear right now. Well, I that's positive and encouraging to hear a representative, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dcHV0u4rZY&t=1386.48s)]
