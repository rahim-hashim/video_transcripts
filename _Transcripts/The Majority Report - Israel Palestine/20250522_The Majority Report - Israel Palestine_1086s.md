# This Guy's Hasan Smears Could Backfire Big Time
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w)
*  What the F does it take says with tongue firmly in cheek? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=0.0s)]
*  I say, how come you're not doing wall to wall coverage of the shooting, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=2.5s)]
*  killing in D.C. last night like I continue to see on MSNBC and I'm sure on CNN and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=5.2s)]
*  FNC Fox News Channel. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=9.96s)]
*  You know, it's tricky because it's it's it's horrible that that that the those [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  folks were killed. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=18.8s)]
*  I mean, that's there's nothing that I can say that defends that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=19.5s)]
*  I think that any further conflation of anti Zionism with anti Semitism [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=23.3s)]
*  is unfortunately contributing to that kind of environment, including by progressive [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=29.1s)]
*  people who are running for Congress and panicking and calling the attack [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=36.2s)]
*  anti Semitism. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=40.4s)]
*  Bernie Sanders had it right when he just said it's violence and it shouldn't be [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=41.2s)]
*  tolerated. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=45.6s)]
*  But to call it anti Semitism is a huge fucking problem and people need to get on [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=46.3s)]
*  the right page on some of this stuff. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=49.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=52.2s)]
*  Even listen, even people who think that there, you know, there are reasons for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=52.7s)]
*  violence at times. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=56.8s)]
*  This clearly isn't that issue. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=58.0s)]
*  Like if you want to compare it to something that like contrasted, I should say [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=59.8s)]
*  to something like, for example, Luigi Mangione allegedly knew who was in charge [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=63.9s)]
*  at the United Health Care Company and that's who he took his anger out on. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=71.0s)]
*  Allegedly in this case, these were just two random people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=76.9s)]
*  They have no power over the situation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=81.7s)]
*  You know, it doesn't matter what you think of them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=85.6s)]
*  They are completely bystanders, bystanders who have no power to do anything, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=87.5s)]
*  whether it is to continue in Gaza or to stop in Gaza. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  They are just powerless. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  So going even doing what this guy did and that looking at it that way is just [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  the guy was the guy was wrong and it should be called out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=102.5s)]
*  Obviously fully because it's just stupid. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=106.1s)]
*  Well said. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=109.5s)]
*  Well said. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  The other thing I would just say is this that violence and the two Palestinian [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=111.8s)]
*  students in Vermont that were shot and the young Palestinian boy in Illinois [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=117.0s)]
*  killed by his landlord. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=121.9s)]
*  All of those acts of violence were taking place in an environment created by [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=123.5s)]
*  the genocide being perpetrated by Israel and supported by our government. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=127.2s)]
*  That needs to change or these types of violence are going to continue. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=131.4s)]
*  We also in addition to South Africa, a very violent country, the president [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=135.2s)]
*  of the United States almost got his head blown off. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=138.7s)]
*  Last summer in order to stop this we need to take down the heat and that's [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=141.0s)]
*  not going to happen when images of starving children are continuing to pour [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=146.1s)]
*  over the the airwaves and that they should those images to continue as long [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=151.7s)]
*  as kids are being starved intentionally. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=157.4s)]
*  And the other thing is is absolutely no to people like the ADL who are going [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=159.3s)]
*  to use this and already are have hit CNN's airwaves to attack people like [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=163.5s)]
*  Hassan or the anti-Israel protests in general. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely no to any of that and those are the political imperatives to stop [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=173.1s)]
*  the genocide and absolutely no no to supporters of Israel who want to use [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=176.7s)]
*  this tragedy as a pretext to further attack freedoms that we have in this [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=181.5s)]
*  country or should have in this country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=188.4s)]
*  Well since we're on the topic Russ, thanks for finding this here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=190.0s)]
*  This is Jonathan Greenblatt who went on CNN and went after Hassan Piker who [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=193.5s)]
*  by the way was just detained for his speech coming back into the country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=198.0s)]
*  This is absolutely despicable. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=203.3s)]
*  Fascist. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=205.5s)]
*  But all of us need to call it out. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=207.1s)]
*  I'm thinking about the New York Times doing a gauzy profile a few weeks ago [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=209.2s)]
*  of this gamer Hassan Piker who regularly employs awful genocidal rhetoric [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=214.3s)]
*  against Jewish people in the Jewish state. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=219.8s)]
*  That's a heinous smear. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=222.1s)]
*  That's a defamation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=223.5s)]
*  I would sue him for that if I was Hassan. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=224.3s)]
*  That is 100% slanderous. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=227.8s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=230.1s)]
*  He should. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=230.9s)]
*  He's got money. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=231.5s)]
*  He should sue him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=232.4s)]
*  Honestly. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=233.3s)]
*  He should. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=233.9s)]
*  That is beyond what I was expecting. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=234.7s)]
*  I had not seen that clip. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=237.0s)]
*  Well they've shown... [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=238.5s)]
*  Sorry Bender I got heated go on. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=240.0s)]
*  No it's I mean that is that is a direct accusation of a very specific thing [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=242.1s)]
*  that Hassan has not done. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=248.6s)]
*  And if I was Hassan I would look into legal my legal rights here and go after this guy [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=250.2s)]
*  and the organization he's speaking for honestly. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=257.3s)]
*  The ADL has shown that they can be cowed by money. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=260.1s)]
*  They accused rightly Elon Musk of anti-Semitism when he endorsed the great replacement [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=262.9s)]
*  theory on social media. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=267.7s)]
*  Then it's just like a little weird. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=269.5s)]
*  Suddenly they were really pro Elon Musk. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=272.3s)]
*  Maybe less money and more just oh you're going to work with us because we're a fascist [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=274.7s)]
*  government doing fascism and you're you have the ear of the Americans. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=278.5s)]
*  I mean I think I think that it could be a coincidence but also Starling started to work [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=281.9s)]
*  with the Israeli government and then what do you know a year later they're turning the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=287.4s)]
*  other cheek when Elon Musk is endorsing the far-right German party that says that we should [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=291.4s)]
*  leave the Holocaust in the past and quit remembering and then doing Nazi salutes at the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=297.2s)]
*  inauguration repeated as AOC said at the time for emphasis and clarity. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=301.8s)]
*  They've shown that they can look the other way on that but. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=306.3s)]
*  Could we rewind rewind a little bit just so I could fully hear exactly what he accused [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=310.3s)]
*  Hassan of doing because if he had claimed Hassan was sharing anti-Semitic rhetoric that'd [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=315.1s)]
*  be a little bit harder to go after because you could claim a lot of things are anti-Semitic [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=322.3s)]
*  that's sort of an eye of the beholder right but we have made it clear that we have made [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=327.1s)]
*  it very clear over this past year especially from people like him and the ADL that accusing [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  someone of genocide is a very specific framework and for you to then declare that someone is [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=338.8s)]
*  using genocidal rhetoric against the specific group of people that is slander and I without [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  a doubt Hassan should go after them if that's indeed what he said and I'm pretty sure he [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  did. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=355.8s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=357.3s)]
*  But all of us need to call it out. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=358.29999999999995s)]
*  I'm thinking about the New York Times doing a gauzy profile a few weeks ago of this gamer [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=360.4s)]
*  Hassan Piker who regularly employs awful genocidal rhetoric against people in the Jewish [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=366.29999999999995s)]
*  State like the extremists should not be empowered people who spout prejudice should not be [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  platformed. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=380.09999999999997s)]
*  This is a moment when we need to look ourselves in the mirror and say we've got to stop this [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=381.5s)]
*  because the consequences are deadly but deadly state to call but I mean do you see how you [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=387.0s)]
*  can place like Jewish people broadly with a Jewish state like the ethno-nationalist [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=393.2s)]
*  state of Israel and to be fair like he's doing just like we were talking about with the South [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=397.5s)]
*  Africans right there. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=402.0s)]
*  He's trying to make their inability to hold control over a state a piece of land as an [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=403.2s)]
*  ethno-nationalist state because we know that a lot of people in Israel who are Zionists [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=410.7s)]
*  think that the you know one state solution the state where we have they have equal presentation [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=415.2s)]
*  for Palestinians equal presentation for Israel is the genocide they're referring to they're [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=419.7s)]
*  not referring to the total eradication of Israelis. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=424.0s)]
*  You know Jewish Israelis by Arab they're referring to a changing of the structure that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=427.7s)]
*  prevents there from being an ethno-nationalist state apartheid state which provides special [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  rights for Israelis in that back pre-permanent underclass of Palestinians and unlike in the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  situation with the white South Africans. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=443.7s)]
*  They are able to more readily reference an index of actual genocide that happened to Jewish [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=446.4s)]
*  people and cloak themselves in the veil of people who you know are unfamiliar probably [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  with the current situation broadly speaking unfamiliar probably with the history of the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=456.5s)]
*  Holocaust and how Western powers the beyond Germany facilitated and encouraged and inspired [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=461.2s)]
*  it and they're probably also likely especially for the liberals that this is aimed at [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=469.2s)]
*  unfamiliar with what systemic and structural oppression and you know in offshoots like genocide [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=473.5s)]
*  are actually like and so it's very easy for them to be cowed by stuff like this. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=478.9s)]
*  But like you know when you see Israeli people talk about like the genocide being aimed at [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=483.2s)]
*  them by Palestinians you should treat it with the same kind of skepticism that you treat [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=488.0s)]
*  the white South Africaners who are saying the same thing about the genocide being aimed [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=492.29999999999995s)]
*  at them by like the black people that they're surrounded by is they're not talking about [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=496.5s)]
*  the total eradication of their people. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=500.9s)]
*  They're talking about a shift in cultural norms that would prevent them from having [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=502.79999999999995s)]
*  like a hierarchy where that is racialized or ethnicized in the case of Jewish people [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=506.79999999999995s)]
*  and that they're the top of inherently that's not the same thing as what the Palestinians [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=512.1s)]
*  are going through and it's certainly not you know the same thing at what as what genocide [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=517.0s)]
*  is. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=521.1s)]
*  It's a it's a white supremacist conflation. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=521.9s)]
*  It's the great replacement theory but applied to a variety of different contexts where the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=524.0s)]
*  eradication of a people is conflated with racial integration when folks like Hassan [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=529.2s)]
*  or us we talk about from the river to the sea and we talk about one democratic state [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=534.5s)]
*  we mean no not killing of Israelis not killing of Jews not killing of Palestinians one [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=539.1s)]
*  democratic state where people live side by side and the idea that smear merchants like [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=545.9000000000001s)]
*  this guy are conflating basically the end of an apartheid system and the end of a genocide [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=551.0s)]
*  and racial and ethnic integration into a land where that can be shared and should be [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=557.3s)]
*  shared with genocide is just white supremacist talking points. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=563.4s)]
*  It's the same thing as when you hear the great replacement theory stuff and it's no wonder [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=567.0999999999999s)]
*  that Greenblatt was okay with the endorsement of that anti-Semitic conspiracy theory by [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=573.0999999999999s)]
*  someone like Elon Musk because at the end of the day it's kind of the version that Israel [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=579.0s)]
*  deploys to continue justifying its genocide. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=584.5s)]
*  Same demographic anxiety. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=587.1s)]
*  Yeah to take what Emma just said. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=588.8000000000001s)]
*  I want to take it even a step further the audacity of people like Greenblatt to treat [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=590.5s)]
*  for this past these past nearly two years the word genocide and accusations of genocide [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=596.8000000000001s)]
*  as some sort of like like a super high standard like the Holy Grail of if you dare say that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=603.2s)]
*  you better back it up. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=611.4s)]
*  And here he is throwing it around to go after and this is no offense to Hassan but to make [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=612.9s)]
*  my point here just a live streamer who's never taken a single life. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=618.2s)]
*  You know the idea that you would just claim what he just said about Hassan to take it [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=623.0s)]
*  a step further what Emma just said what Greenblatt just did here is no different than [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=628.9s)]
*  Donald Trump and Elon Musk out there claiming there's a white genocide in South Africa. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=633.9s)]
*  It's the same bullshit. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=639.2s)]
*  Right but is this genocidal? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=641.7s)]
*  This is a Republican congressman here. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=643.4s)]
*  What his suggestion is after this horrible shooting in DC. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=646.0s)]
*  The fact of the matter is the Palestinian cause is an evil one. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=650.8s)]
*  Yeah and congressman there is a ceasefire deal on the table right now that the White [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=655.1s)]
*  House is hoping both Israel and Hamas will sign on to. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=658.8s)]
*  Does this shooting change anything when it comes to the course of the war or the negotiations [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=662.1s)]
*  to end it? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=667.4s)]
*  Well I think it speaks to the importance of the only end of the conflict is complete and [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=669.0s)]
*  total surrender by those who support Muslim terror in World War two. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=673.5s)]
*  We did not negotiate a surrender with the Nazis. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=677.4s)]
*  We did not negotiate a surrender with the Japanese. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=680.2s)]
*  We nuked the Japanese twice. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=682.7s)]
*  We did. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=684.7s)]
*  Donald's words. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=685.1s)]
*  Additional surrender that needs to be the same here. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=685.7s)]
*  There is something deeply deeply wrong with this culture and it needs to be culture. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=689.2s)]
*  We heard in Brooks. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=695.7s)]
*  So if you if you heard that correctly, that's him suggesting the nuking of Gaza. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=696.4s)]
*  We did just have an interview speaking to David Hearst of Middle East Eye who wrote [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=700.4s)]
*  in his piece about how in over the course of eight years the United States dropped 5 [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=706.3s)]
*  million tons of bombs on Vietnam. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=711.1s)]
*  Gaza is 141 ish square miles. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=713.6999999999999s)]
*  Israel's now dropped a hundred thousand tons of bombs on Gaza. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=717.0s)]
*  And so that's like in terms of just what we're talking like that's a whole country of Vietnam. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=720.8s)]
*  We're historic levels of slaughter here and we should say that if this was reversed, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=729.9s)]
*  right? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=739.4s)]
*  If say to use that that old clip from from Michael where he said if the situation was [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=740.3s)]
*  reversed and a group of Palestinians was concentrating Jews into this small territory [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=748.3s)]
*  and bombing the hell out of them. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=755.1999999999999s)]
*  We would have the exact same reaction. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=756.4s)]
*  He's basically implicating Hassan in this hate crime one because of his popularity, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=759.5999999999999s)]
*  but I would also suspect suspect because of his last name because of his first name like [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=766.5999999999999s)]
*  there's real anti-islamophobic racism here that would never be tolerated if another if a [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=771.4s)]
*  Jewish person with that last name was being implicated in a hate crime committed by somebody [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=776.4s)]
*  else because it's racist. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=783.3s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=785.1s)]
*  Look at the reaction that our media had to the young Palestinian boy being murdered by [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=785.9s)]
*  the landlord or the two Vermonters shot and we're going to barely even mentioned where [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=790.1s)]
*  and this but the media will talk about this because the media can do something with this [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=797.1999999999999s)]
*  that it wants to do which is to come for your freedoms just like they did after 9-11. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=800.6999999999999s)]
*  Also, they don't even talk about that like shooting that happened in Florida a few weeks [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=804.9s)]
*  ago where the pro-israeli guy shot up a car with other Israelis in it because he thought [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=808.7s)]
*  that they were like Arabs like that was another shooting that happened like a while ago and [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=814.1s)]
*  that people have forgotten although there was like a bit of a humor after it and I would [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=819.8000000000001s)]
*  just say to your point Emma. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=823.8000000000001s)]
*  I actually disagree a little bit. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=825.1s)]
*  I think that the things that make Islamophobia popular and okay have a lot to do with the [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  material circumstances in the Middle East and the demographics there and I only emphasize [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=832.0s)]
*  that because I think people get in their head the wrong idea that there is a type of person [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=835.6s)]
*  besides incredibly wealthy and well-connected that you can be that if you were to stand [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=840.6999999999999s)]
*  against the American Empire and its aims that we would just like be forced to fold the American [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=846.0s)]
*  people just be forced to fold like oh, we just value that population inherently based [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=850.6s)]
*  on that it's too much. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=854.9s)]
*  I think we would just craft different propaganda. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=855.9s)]
*  I think ultimately like the issues in the Middle East are related to like the resources [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=858.3000000000001s)]
*  that we have there and yes, there is a very strong undercurrent of Islamophobia, but that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=861.8000000000001s)]
*  is inextricable from our material aims in the Middle East and our and our aims and those [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=866.8000000000001s)]
*  because we have no problem engaging in business dealings with countries or country heads of [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=872.9000000000001s)]
*  country that are islamophobic. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=878.9000000000001s)]
*  We have no problem engaging with them with their anti-semitic if they're religious zealots [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=880.4000000000001s)]
*  if they're theocrats if they're warlords. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=884.5s)]
*  I think that a lot of Americans imagine that there is a you know, what if I'm like a white [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=886.9s)]
*  person I could be, you know, given carte blanche. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=890.8s)]
*  That's just the circumstances right now and they're trying to change those circumstances [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=893.9s)]
*  to make it easier and easier to like put people in jail to to exile them to all those sorts [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=898.3s)]
*  of things. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=902.9s)]
*  Yeah, and I think the Islamophobia like you look back at like our relations with Muslim [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=903.9s)]
*  countries 50 years ago was better than it is now and that's because the Zionist project [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=907.6999999999999s)]
*  has continued this far along and it's just making it worse. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=911.9s)]
*  Read Avi Shlaim read about, you know, the history of him being a Jewish person who is [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=915.2s)]
*  from the Middle East and what Zionism did to his relationships with his neighbors. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=921.7s)]
*  Yeah, great essay by over zealots on YouTube and on that people can check out. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=926.4s)]
*  All right guys gonna read some I ams and then I got the jump. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=934.0s)]
*  Nadi Queen says you guys are using Islamic and Arabic interchangeably and while there [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=938.3000000000001s)]
*  is overlap, it's not the same as Islam is a religion and not all Muslims are Arabic. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=941.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=945.9s)]
*  That's true. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=947.3s)]
*  But we also understand that in our in our popular culture and I don't think we shouldn't [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=947.9s)]
*  like make the distinction. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=952.5s)]
*  We do racialize those things together. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=953.8s)]
*  That's why when we talk about what's who is under attack in Gaza, there's a specific [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=955.6999999999999s)]
*  emphasis on Arabs and a specific emphasis on Muslims because they don't want you to [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=960.0999999999999s)]
*  be able to identify with the fact that there is a diverse population in the Middle East [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=964.5999999999999s)]
*  because that's part of the propaganda we've weaponized against them in our asymmetrical [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=968.9s)]
*  warfare that the Middle East is a homogenized area full of Arab Muslim men between the ages [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=972.6s)]
*  of 16 to 45 who are legitimate bombing targets and there are no Christians. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=977.6s)]
*  There are no women. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=981.6999999999999s)]
*  There are no children. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=982.4s)]
*  There are no Sikhs. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=983.5s)]
*  There are no Persians. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=984.8s)]
*  There are no anything. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=986.6999999999999s)]
*  And so we definitely have to always do be on the guard for that kind of thing. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=987.6999999999999s)]
*  But that is just the parlance and that's part of the weapon that they use against people. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=990.8s)]
*  Yeah, they're white Muslims. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=995.6999999999999s)]
*  There are Arab Christians, but you know, I honestly do think that like the whitest Muslim [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=997.4s)]

*  a Muslim, you know, if they are wearing it traditional Muslim garb, they will receive [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=1010.3s)]
*  that same hatred because here our racists have been taught that there is no difference. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=1014.6s)]
*  There's no such thing. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=1019.5s)]
*  If you are wearing that or you are or you are certain skin color or both, you are the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=1020.6s)]
*  other that we hate doesn't matter as long as you are one or both. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=1027.8s)]
*  They'll come after you. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbV5MH1o7w&t=1031.4s)]
