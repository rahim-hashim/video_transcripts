# Rubio Squirms When Iran Fact-Check Hits Hard
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc)
*  Marco Rubio trying to address the fact that all of the US intelligence on Iran [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=0.0s)]
*  has consistently shown that the Iranians are not pursuing a nuclear weapon and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=9.76s)]
*  have had no [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=17.68s)]
*  Program to do so since 2003. How do you deal with this? You don't want to go on there and go [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=19.92s)]
*  But Israel says it's the case [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=27.66s)]
*  Because Israel's been saying it's the case for 25 years [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=30.5s)]
*  This is the slowest march to nuclear weapon in the history of nuclear weapons [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=33.620000000000005s)]
*  Here is Marco Rubio, here's the best he came up with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=42.18s)]
*  On a phrase you just word weaponization ambitions [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=47.14s)]
*  Are you saying there that the United States did not see intelligence that the supreme leader had ordered? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=50.919999999999995s)]
*  weaponization [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=58.64s)]
*  That's irrelevant I think that question being asked in the media all that's any relevant question [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=61.12s)]
*  I have a key point in US intelligence assessment, you know, yes, it was [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=65.12s)]
*  Political decision I know that better than you know that and I know that that's not the case [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=69.88s)]
*  But you know, I'm asking whether the order was given and the people who say that it doesn't matter if the order was given [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=73.68s)]
*  They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons. Why would you bury? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=79.24s)]
*  Why would you bury things in a mountain 300 feet under the ground? Why would you bury six? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  Why do they have 60% enriched uranium? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=86.56s)]
*  You don't need 60% enriched uranium the only countries in the world that have uranium at 60% [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=88.44s)]
*  Our countries that have nuclear weapons because it can do quickly make it 90 they have all the elements [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=93.08s)]
*  They have why are they why do they have a space program is Iran gonna go to the moon? No positive for a second [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  I want to remind you [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=102.72s)]
*  that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=104.84s)]
*  20 years ago [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=106.44s)]
*  George W. Bush [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=109.0s)]
*  Said that Iran was part of the axis of evil [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  Is Iran Iraq and North Korea [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=118.0s)]
*  Iraq was shattered [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=122.84s)]
*  If I'm Iran, why would I have 60% uranium because I need [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=127.32s)]
*  some type of protection I [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=133.96s)]
*  Need the idea that I could do this even though I don't want to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=136.24s)]
*  Because [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=143.84s)]
*  How else do I stop? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  The world's most powerful military from bombing me [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=148.52s)]
*  It's a very basic easy question [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=153.52s)]
*  How do I supposedly why we have them I? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=157.8s)]
*  Look at Libya and they gave up their nuclear program [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=162.4s)]
*  It was a guy named Muammar Gaddafi who is six feet underground now [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=166.96s)]
*  Like the it's the only possible protection that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  They have and so despite the fact that they don't want to have a program despite the fact they don't have a program [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=178.52s)]
*  They imply that we couldn't have a program if you continue to do something like bomb us [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=188.08s)]
*  good [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=195.44s)]
*  You don't need 60% enrich your and the only countries in the world that have uranium at 60% [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=197.16s)]
*  Our countries that have nuclear weapons because it can do quickly make it 90 they have all the elements [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=201.88s)]
*  They have why are they why do they have a space program is Iran gonna go to the moon? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=207.2s)]
*  No, they're trying to build an ICBM [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=210.16s)]
*  That's a question of intent and you know in the intelligence assessment that it was that Iran wanted to be a threshold [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=213.88s)]
*  Use this leverage says I'm talking about with the public March assessment, and that's why I was asking you if you know something more [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=219.66s)]
*  Of it that's an accurate representation of it. That's not how intelligence positive. That's not now first off [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=228.7s)]
*  Marco Rubio is [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=235.74s)]
*  Saying that it's the wrong [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=238.06s)]
*  takeaway from that intelligent [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=240.74s)]
*  assessment the next question really should be them why is [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=243.1s)]
*  The director of national intelligence not invited in the room as you guys are making these decisions [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  It's almost like you don't want to hear from the intelligence community [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=254.26s)]
*  Good patient of it. That's an accurate and representation of it. That's not how intelligence is read. That's not how intelligence is used [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=258.9s)]
*  Here's what the whole world knows now forget about intelligence with the IA [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=265.74s)]
*  They are enriching uranium well beyond anything you need for a for a for a civil nuclear program [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  So why would you enrich uranium she just answered for special right if you don't intend to one day use it to take it [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=276.74s)]
*  To 90 and build a weapon why you why are you developing ICBM leverage? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=282.06s)]
*  Why do you have 8,000 short-range missiles and two to three thousand long? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=285.86s)]
*  Mid-range missiles that you continue to develop why do you do all these things I? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=290.02s)]
*  Think we found out the answered about those short-range missiles [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=294.90000000000003s)]
*  two weeks ago when Israel unilaterally started a [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=299.26s)]
*  war on Iran [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=303.62s)]
*  They have a crazy neighbor they wanted to turn is the answer good [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=306.02s)]
*  Why do you have 8,000 short-range missiles and two to three thousand long mid-range missiles that you continue to develop? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=312.38s)]
*  Why do you do all these things I have everything they need for a nuclear weapon? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=319.42s)]
*  Why do we do delivery mechanisms they have the enrich why do we do it they have the highly enriched uranium that is stored? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=323.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's all we need to see right what why do we do it? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=328.14s)]
*  We have a lot more than 8,000 missiles [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=332.78s)]
*  Why do we do it? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=337.21999999999997s)]
*  Peace through strength [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=342.06s)]
*  Peace through strength, I mean this is all such bullshit. It's amazing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=345.38s)]
*  It's amazing it. It's even more amazing than it was during a rock because a [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=351.5s)]
*  Like six weeks ago none of these guys were saying any of this stuff and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=359.62s)]
*  The level of savvy that the country has to this stuff is much higher than it was back then and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=366.9s)]
*  There's no state of shock from 9-eleven it is [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=374.7s)]
*  It is impressive that they can go on and also be so bad at it [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=381.94s)]
*  I feel like there are Instagram influencers, you know hawking some type of like [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=387.5s)]
*  You know homeopathic stuff that sounds more convincing than this [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=394.5s)]
*  It's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=401.85999999999996s)]
*  It's nuts [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=403.58s)]
*  Really is the tragedy and farce sort of thing it totally is [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=405.41999999999996s)]
*  Who knew the Iraq war wasn't the farce? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=410.53999999999996s)]
*  Hey for weeks all we've heard is how Trump's big beautiful bill will cut Medicaid [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=412.78s)]
*  But almost no one's reporting on a buried provision that would make Trump untouchable [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=418.38s)]
*  Go to ground dot news slash majority to see how this bill would block judges from enforcing court orders [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=423.17999999999995s)]
*  Unless you the citizen post a bond first [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=430.21999999999997s)]
*  Highly credible sources warn most people can't actually afford to do this and that's pretty obvious [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=433.73999999999995s)]
*  And nobody even knows which means the GOP's flood the zone strategy is working [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=439.09999999999997s)]
*  And it's why I think ground news is the best tool to expose these blind spots before it's too late [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=444.06s)]
*  My partner's built the only app and website pulling in news from across the globe [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=450.46s)]
*  Then breaking down each sources bias credibility and the news the right tries to bury [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=454.94s)]
*  And continue to do this and that's pretty obvious [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=461.41999999999996s)]
*  And considering most people take the first article they see online as fact their browser extension is essential [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=464.46s)]
*  What it does is it flags the sources bias and links other credible reports to verify the information? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=470.7s)]
*  Ground news is a better version of how we're already staying informed [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PFIlHevAc&t=476.94s)]
