# Carville: Antisemitism Is Weaponized By Rich Zionists
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8)
*  This is sort of fascinating and when I first saw it, it sort of like, you know, people were talking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=0.0s)]
*  about Carvel being sort of, it feels like it's going to go in one direction and then it goes in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=6.32s)]
*  another. Here's James Carvel on with Al Hunt, who I don't know if people remember him, but he used [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=10.4s)]
*  to be a sort of a talking head on TV. And Carvel, well, this is just an interesting perspective he [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=17.28s)]
*  has on this. I tell you who this exposes in a more profound way and I hear this all the time, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=24.96s)]
*  a lot of, you gotta try to raise money from really wealthy Jewish fundraisers. And it's little of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  James, I'm a Democrat, but I can't be a part of a party because of what happened at Columbia. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=38.64s)]
*  What the fuck did the Democrats have to do with what happened at Columbia, by the way? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=46.0s)]
*  Right? But yeah, because they have some students at Columbia fucking, you know, generally made an [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=51.2s)]
*  ass of themselves. Well, I can't do that, but I can be for a party that everybody endorses the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=58.32s)]
*  alternative for Deutschland. I pause for one second. Let me just make it so that people [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=66.08s)]
*  can follow what's going on. Carvel is talking about going to big donor [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=71.76s)]
*  organizations, where Jewish fundraisers, where maybe a Jewish organization or, you know, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  big donors are there. He goes, they say, I can't support the Democratic Party because of what's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=86.56s)]
*  going on at Columbia. My Zionism. Carvel, you know, disregards what's going on at Columbia. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=92.72s)]
*  I disagree, obviously, with his assessment, but he makes the point that like Democrats don't have [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  anything to do with it. And then these people are like, well, I can't donate to the Democratic [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=104.72s)]
*  Party. I just want to keep people. So where are you going with this? Yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=114.0s)]
*  Everybody endorses the alternative for Deutschland. We need the modern incarnation of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=119.6s)]
*  national socialism, if you will. And I just find these kind of people, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=129.28s)]
*  I literally, my instinct is, and they tell me that, they look me right in the eye. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=135.76s)]
*  And I said, no, you just want your fucking tax cut. Now that doesn't apply to me. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=141.6s)]
*  Most people, most Jewish people see right through that. But the ones that don't see through it, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=149.2s)]
*  they just don't really at the end of the day, they just want that fucking tax cut. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=156.8s)]
*  And you can see it every day. Well, there's a guy named Bill Ackman, who's the top of that list, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=160.96s)]
*  James. Right up there. Right up there. I hear I stand, I can do no other. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=166.72s)]
*  All right. So, you know, he's saying here that these people support Trump and the Republican Party [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=172.8s)]
*  ostensibly because of what's going on at Columbia. But in fact, they're doing it because [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=178.4s)]
*  they just want their tax cuts. They want to vote for Republicans. And they're using the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  the cover of anti-Semitism as a way of justifying it. And he thinks it's ironic that they're using [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  anti-Semitism as a cover for supporting a fascistic party, all because they want their tax cuts. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=197.36s)]
*  Now, there's a couple of things that I don't think that Carvel means to point out in telling [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  this story. One is that anti-Semitism is being weaponized in a bunch of different ways that cut [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=213.68s)]
*  against a fair society, that cuts against things like freedom of speech, even though he thinks it's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=225.44s)]
*  wackadoodle or whatever. It is being weaponized in a way. I mean, we see it in the context of, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=236.8s)]
*  like, you know, what Chuck Schumer's even doing. And these people are not going to vote for us [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=244.32s)]
*  anyways. And so, like, there's a lesson to be learned if you're genuinely concerned about [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=250.56s)]
*  Democrats winning, that you cannot capitulate to these big money people, that, you know, Joe Biden [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=258.8s)]
*  Kamala Harris made a very big mistake as a political matter, never mind moral matter, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=266.72s)]
*  but as a political matter, because that's all Carvel cares about. I just care about winning. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=275.68s)]
*  Yeah. Makes a very big mistake in trying to kowtow to these people, because on the other hand, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=279.6s)]
*  and you can look at the numbers now, where's the Democratic Party, even young people on the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  Republican Party, where they are in this conflict. And if you're going to just look at the sheer [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=294.64s)]
*  political value of something, you're not going to win over those people. There's this, there's also [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=303.52s)]
*  a lesson in the sense that, you know, sometimes it's easy to forget that these are politicians [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  that, like, they're humans, too, to a degree, and they're influenced by the people that are in the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=313.68s)]
*  room with them. Like, Joe Biden's been a politician since he was in his early 30s, for the most part, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  and he was in a bunch of rooms with Zionist donors pretending to represent Judaism. And even [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=323.6s)]
*  the way Carvel responses, like, you know, he wouldn't say the word Zionist, but that's what he [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=329.12s)]
*  should be saying. Exactly. He should be saying Zionist instead of Jewish donors. That's exactly [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=334.48s)]
*  what I mean. That's the thing is that like they may be there are Jewish. Listen, there are Jewish [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  organizations. I imagine there's Catholic ones. There is, you know, Christian fundamentalist ones. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, there's Latino and Black. I mean, there are plenty of there's labor. I mean, there's plenty [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  of ways that people end up like organizing themselves and in giving money. I'm sure there's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=355.28s)]
*  a lot of Jewish people who give a lot of money, but they don't do it in the context of a Jewish [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=362.8s)]
*  organization or a Jewish network of funding. But they are gathering around. It's quite clear that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  A, they're Zionist and they want their tax cuts and they're just rich people. And he won't label [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=375.76s)]
*  it Zionist, though, in that instance, because he understands that like that can be used. Like you [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=381.12s)]
*  follow that logic out and you start to realize, hey, wait a second. Yeah. A lot of the things that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=391.52s)]
*  he on in other instances promotes is I mean, this is a guy incidentally, too, who I think like [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  will discount the power of money and that agenda. You know, they just want our tax cuts is a [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=405.52s)]
*  shorthand. They're saying that like money and interests are attempting to influence our politics. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=414.88s)]
*  But they also it's also just not true that they just want their tax cuts in my view. I mean, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=421.2s)]
*  they are committed to a vision of ethnic and racial supremacy that is he's not going to say [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=426.24s)]
*  Jewish people are committed to that because that would be false and wrong to say if he were to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=432.4s)]
*  extrapolate, he should say Zionists are committed. Yes, they want their tax cuts. But that same [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=438.23999999999995s)]
*  people, that same cohort, they're also very comfortable with genocide. They want to be able [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=443.84s)]
*  to do what they need to do without anyone complaining about it or influencing their kids [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=449.12s)]
*  about it, which is what's actually going on with Ackman. And he tries to sort of say like, you know, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  not the most Jews can see through that. What is it they're seeing through? Right. It's the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=458.0s)]
*  Zionism. But there's a generational divide, even anecdotally in trying to get people to separate [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=462.16s)]
*  Zionism and Judaism. And Carvel's an older guy from the older part of the Democratic Party. That [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=468.0s)]
*  conflation with that generation of Democrat, it's it's I would say argue that that is has [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  anti-Semitism that undergirds it while they pretend to be combating anti-Semitism. But it's a [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=480.48s)]
*  reflexive thing where people in that generation conflate Israel and Judaism and what... Look the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=485.6s)]
*  way Cuomo answers questions about this sort of stuff. It's 100 percent. I mean, and they are [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=492.48s)]
*  enabling the increase of anti-Semitism in this country with that conflation. They are enabling [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=499.04s)]
*  the continuation of genocide. They are enabling the McCarthyite crackdown on the protests of this [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  when they continue to conflate Zionism and Judaism. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNwTHKXXDD8&t=510.48s)]
