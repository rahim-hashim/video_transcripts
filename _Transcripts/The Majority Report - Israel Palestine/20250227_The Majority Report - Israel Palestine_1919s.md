# Trump's Axis Of Aggressors | Trita Parsi | TMR
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk)
*  We are back and we are joined once again by friend of the show, Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trita, thanks so much for coming on the show today. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  Of course. It's always good to talk to you, even though we're at the beginning of the Trump administration. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  So, I guess let's start first with Ukraine. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=20.2s)]
*  I think this was really notable and I'm calling this the axis of aggressors because it feels like that's what Trump seems to be orienting our foreign policy towards. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=24.9s)]
*  The United States and Israel joined Russia in voting against this United Nations resolution that would have condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=35.4s)]
*  Trump calls Zelensky a dictator, won't call Putin a dictator. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=44.4s)]
*  Even what he said the other day about, I don't care if China takes Taiwan. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=51.6s)]
*  Now, I'm not a China hawk, but it does seem like he is basically saying, hey, the bullies, if you want to bully, go ahead. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=58.1s)]
*  Yeah, a lot to unpack there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=66.1s)]
*  And a lot of very disturbing things certainly have been said. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=72.1s)]
*  And I think, of course, one of the most problematic ones are what they call the depopulation of Gaza, which is nothing more than actual complete ethnic cleansing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=78.8s)]
*  But if we start off with Ukraine, I would just take a step back and say, look, I think so much of our discourse has become focused on, are you doing the right name calling against the right person? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=89.8s)]
*  I would actually prefer that we would just stay away from referring to anyone necessarily as a dictator or not and try to just figure out how do we resolve some of these problems. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=102.0s)]
*  Plenty of countries around the world are going to be headed by dictators and we're going to have to deal with them one way or another. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=113.0s)]
*  But the discourse in the United States over the last, not just the last few years, but for quite some time, has just become a foreign policy of name calling. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=120.0s)]
*  And Trump is taking it to a new level because now he's switching and calling Zelensky a dictator and not Putin, et cetera. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=129.2s)]
*  But bottom line, if you want to solve some of these issues, I don't think it's necessarily very helpful to call either one of that, but instead focus on actually what needs to be done here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=136.2s)]
*  And there was a moment where that was happening. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=145.2s)]
*  I have to say I'm struck by some of the things happening right now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=146.2s)]
*  You had Rick Grinnell, a former aide to John Bolton, sitting on the stage at CPAC and explaining why we need to talk to countries that we disagree with, which is the position that the Democrats tended to have. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, this is one of the big things that Obama brought in after eight years of Bush in which we were told we can only talk to countries we agree with. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  If we talk to countries we disagree with, we will legitimize them and their policies and their leaders. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  And now it's just like a complete switcheroo in which you have not just a Republican or someone like Grinnell, who as a Bolton protégé was actually on the forefront of trying to delegitimize diplomacy as a whole. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=176.6s)]
*  And now he's sitting at the CPAC stage and making this case. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=190.6s)]
*  And I think it says something. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=193.6s)]
*  We've lost grounding. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=194.6s)]
*  I'm not seeing a foreign policy on the left or the right necessarily that is actually grounded in specific principles, but it's just a reactive name calling type of foreign policy in which you have to have a political power. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=196.6s)]
*  I think that's something that is really important, and it's very important that we're seeing the world go in a very, very negative direction. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=206.6s)]
*  And I think that's the kind of thing that we're seeing in the United States as a whole. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=213.6s)]
*  We're seeing the world go in a very, very negative direction in general. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=216.6s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=220.6s)]
*  And I'm one who who welcomes those kinds of conversations as well. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=221.6s)]
*  I just do think it's notable when you pair that United Nations vote, which just is is lying. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=226.6s)]
*  And then pair it with the fact that he made that dictator comment, not in a vacuum, but at a Miami event that was being held by the sovereign wealth fund for Saudi Arabia the day after Russia and the United States representatives met in Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  So what's troubling to me about this is the incorporation of Saudi Arabia in our foreign policy in a way that almost mirrors what we've done with Israel. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  No, I think you're absolutely right on that and not very worried about it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=261.0s)]
*  And in fact, some of the arguments that I think has come from the Trump administration themselves as to why they didn't vote for the resolution, but instead voted against it was that look, we're in sensitive negotiations and this could have jeopardized it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=265.0s)]
*  That sounds exactly as our excuses for vetoing resolutions on Israel in which we're saying, you know, the whole negotiation could fall apart if we dare to say one word of criticism against Israel. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=279.2s)]
*  And I think that would be a very negative direction for us to go. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=291.6s)]
*  I think, you know, Trump could easily if that actually was a legitimate reason for he could easily have just abstained on that resolution instead of voting against it together with Russia. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=295.2s)]
*  And look, and there's things in that resolution such as the demand for a full return of Crimea, which probably is going to be impossible. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=307.0s)]
*  And as a result, one can make an argument that this resolution cannot be the basis for negotiation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=314.2s)]
*  But let's be real here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=320.2s)]
*  It's not as if the Russians, if they're faced with an opportunity to end the war diplomatically, would reject it just because the United States voted in favor of that resolution. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=322.2s)]
*  They're, you know, rational enough to be able to set aside that issue. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=334.8s)]
*  So voting with them on this, I think, is sending all the wrong messages, even though I do believe that we need to get back to a place in which we have a much more realistic conversation about what can be achieved on Ukraine and not put forward impossible [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=339.0s)]
*  goals that deliberately or non-deliberately nevertheless makes diplomacy impossible. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  What do you think that this means if the United States is actual actions behind the scenes are matching Trump's public rhetoric? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=364.4s)]
*  What does it mean for Ukraine and where they may look if they don't feel that the United States is negotiating in good faith? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=372.2s)]
*  Does this create an opening for Europe to become more involved in this conflict if the U.S. pulls back? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=380.4s)]
*  Well, I mean, part of what many folks have wanted is for the Europeans to step up much more than they have. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=388.4s)]
*  But the manner in which this is being done right now, I don't I think goes beyond the idea of trying to rebalance that relationship, that transatlantic relationship. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=395.4s)]
*  But and it's going into the territory of just tearing it apart, which I don't think is particularly constructive. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  Europe can do a lot and it can do much more. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=411.4s)]
*  But bottom line here is it's about finding an end to this conflict. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=414.4s)]
*  The bottom line, I think, and we've said this for quite some time during the Biden administration, was that there was really no clear analysis that pointed to the idea that time is on Ukraine's side with Russia's size, manpower, fatigue in the West, not just in the U.S., but in a lot of European countries as well, which is part of the reason why you see some of these right wing populist parties marching forward in the elections. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=419.0s)]
*  It was just impossible to say that if we just keep at this one way or another, we're going to shift and be able to start negotiations from a much better position. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=444.4s)]
*  In fact, if we go back to the fall of 2022, I'm sure you guys covered it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=453.4s)]
*  There was this letter from the Congressional Progressive Caucus that was put out there, was very supportive of Biden, very supportive of Ukraine and the efforts to support Ukraine. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=459.0s)]
*  But he also asked for a diplomatic track to be added to the policy to make sure that we would be able to assess when it is the time to actually shift the diplomacy, prepare the ground for that, be able to be nimble when it's needed to be nimble. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=471.0s)]
*  And you all remember what happened. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=488.8s)]
*  You know, the Biden administration, or actually mostly congressional Democrats, came out swinging against it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=490.6s)]
*  And within 24 hours, the head of the CPC withdrew the letter. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=496.4s)]
*  And we saw that, you know, the space for even just talking about diplomacy was so closed. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=500.8s)]
*  And a lot of the criticism of the letter was, oh, this is so badly timed. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=506.8s)]
*  Ukraine is doing well on the battlefield. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=511.6s)]
*  This is not the time to talk about diplomacy. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=515.2s)]
*  Well, in retrospect, the timing seems to have been near perfect. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=517.8s)]
*  Right, it's the best negotiating position. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=521.4s)]
*  Precisely because Ukraine had momentum on its side. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=525.6s)]
*  And this is important because the plan to get them a better negotiating position, which was that so-called spring offensive, when you scratch the surface of it, it was just a bunch of best case scenarios that had to happen next to each other in sequence in order to get to that magical, better negotiating position. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=529.4s)]
*  And which looked very much like our strategy in Afghanistan. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=552.1999999999999s)]
*  Everything was going to be fine if just these five perfect things happen in the perfect order, which of course they wouldn't. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=556.0s)]
*  So once again, like Afghanistan, we went down the path of a policy based on best case scenarios. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=562.4s)]
*  And it ended up exactly as many of us pointed out at the time that this actually would not end up in Ukraine's favor. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=569.4s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=576.0s)]
*  And I think it's very costly because obviously Ukraine is not in a great position right now. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=577.2s)]
*  And with Trump's lack of affinity, to put it mildly for Ukraine, the Ukrainians have a tremendous amount of reasons to be worried. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=581.4s)]
*  But that is precisely why it would have been better to have started those negotiations earlier and have been done that under Biden. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=590.8s)]
*  But that was not where the Biden administration appeared to want to go. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=598.8s)]
*  I mean, isn't that the theme? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=602.0s)]
*  We're about to talk about Israel in a second, but it really does feel like there's a book that's coming out by Jake Tapper and the guy from Axios about Biden's mental decline. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=603.4s)]
*  It could have been useful during the election or prior to that when we could have had a primary. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=615.1999999999999s)]
*  And it could have been useful if folks at CNN, including Jake Tapper, didn't shut down voices who were calling out that there seems to be something wrong with Biden's mental state. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=620.4s)]
*  But he was on air, you know, pushing very aggressively against any conversation about that. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=630.6s)]
*  Absolutely right. And but the question is, is like it really, I think, will come out hopefully when we get more reporting with this lack of real interest in doing the hard work of diplomacy. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=636.0s)]
*  That's the theme with both Israel and Ukraine here under the Biden administration. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=650.0s)]
*  Why they've left us with such a quagmire with a lunatic in office is just basically that there was really no interest in negotiations. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=656.6s)]
*  It was all about what will support our ally Israel and their military campaign unequivocally. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=666.2s)]
*  And we'll say that we're doing these ceasefire negotiations, but it's really about letting the Israelis do what they want. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=672.8s)]
*  And then with Ukraine, well, this is another opportunity for us here to weaken Russia. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=678.2s)]
*  So we'll continue to just like it feels like it was run by a bunch of think tank neocons is what I'm really trying to say fully. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=683.0s)]
*  Sadly, I think you're absolutely right. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=692.8s)]
*  And I think it raises very important questions, which is how come the Democratic Party that under Obama ran on a platform of restoring diplomacy, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=694.6s)]
*  being adults about the fact that we're going to have to talk to people that we don't have much shared values with, but they're there. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=705.8s)]
*  There's nothing we can do about it. We're not going to go down the path of regime change. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=712.2s)]
*  So we have to deal with that. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=716.0s)]
*  He went from that to a party that rejected diplomacy, slammed down on these members who were completely supportive of the policy. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=717.0s)]
*  They just say, could we also do a bit of diplomacy on the side? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=726.0s)]
*  And that got, you know, I'm not going to name them, but some members of Congress calling them yelling and screaming. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=729.8s)]
*  How did we go from that? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=736.4s)]
*  And then later on, of course, bringing Liz Cheney to Michigan to campaign with and lionizing her, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=738.4000000000001s)]
*  it really raises the question, how did the Democratic Party become the party that so strongly embraced maximalist positions, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=747.0s)]
*  rejection of diplomacy and lionizing of people who are very closely associated with the disasters of the Iraq War? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=754.4000000000001s)]
*  There's some real reckoning that is needed here, and I hope that it will take place very fast because with the speed in which Trump is doing many of these things, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=762.8s)]
*  there's a need for a party that actually can stand up for some strong principles, not just be reactive, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=773.4s)]
*  not just say no to everything that Trump does because it's done by Trump, but actually can push things in the right direction. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=779.0s)]
*  And I'm not seeing that party right now, and I'm not seeing the reckoning that is needed. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=786.4s)]
*  It's so funny you use that word reckoning because as you talk about the Congressional Progressive Caucus, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=791.0s)]
*  the leader of the CPC at the time, Pramila Jayapal, we had her on this program about two months ago, I think, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=796.2s)]
*  and I asked, is the party reckoning with the fact that its full-throated support for Israel may have harmed its brand permanently with some young folks? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=802.8s)]
*  And she said, honestly, I don't think that reckoning is happening. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=813.0s)]
*  So it echoes exactly what you're saying, Trita. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=816.2s)]
*  And some conversations I've had on the Hill, I have to say, the areas in which some reckoning is taking place is, frankly, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=819.0s)]
*  more on Ukraine and less so on Gaza and Israel, which is stunning. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=828.2s)]
*  That's not how I'd order it. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=834.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=836.2s)]
*  It's really stunning, particularly after the poll. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=838.4s)]
*  I'm sure you guys have talked about it. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=840.6s)]
*  19 million voters who voted for Biden in 2020 but didn't vote for him in 2024 stayed home. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=843.0s)]
*  And the plurality of them, 29% larger group than any of the others, said that they stayed home because of Gaza. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=851.6s)]
*  And we still don't have a reckoning about this. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=859.1999999999999s)]
*  And we're still not recognizing that at the end, on Israel-Palestine, this term as well as in the previous term, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=861.0s)]
*  Trump was not a break or a shift from the Democratic policy. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=870.0s)]
*  He was an accelerant of a policy that already was in place. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=875.0s)]
*  The Biden administration themselves, in November 2023, had USAID do feasibility studies to see, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=879.8s)]
*  can you depopulate Gaza and place everyone in the Sinai desert? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=888.2s)]
*  So a lot of these different things are not just coming in now with Trump. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=893.8s)]
*  They were there before. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=897.2s)]
*  They were just not moving in the same place. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=899.0s)]
*  The Abraham Accords. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=900.2s)]
*  Exactly, the Ambracords that just threw the Palestinians completely under the bus. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=902.0s)]
*  And incidentally, according to Biden himself, although he doesn't put it that explicitly, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=905.4s)]
*  is the reason why October 7th happened, because he says that he was on the verge of making peace [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=909.8s)]
*  and Hamas did the attack in order to prevent that. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=915.4s)]
*  And he embraced not only Trump's Abraham Accord, he wanted to take it further. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=919.6s)]
*  And I think one thing that is going to be very interesting to see now is Trump is still talking [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=924.4s)]
*  about some sort of a normalization between Israel and Palestine. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=928.8s)]
*  Is he going to pick up the negotiations where Biden left them off, which would include a defense pact [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=931.8s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia, which means that the United States would actually send troops to defend the kingdom [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=940.8s)]
*  and its authoritarian leaders, as well as giving them very sensitive nuclear technology. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=946.5999999999999s)]
*  This was not part of any of the Abraham Accords that Trump himself did, but this is the direction [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=952.1999999999999s)]
*  that the Biden administration took the negotiations. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=957.0s)]
*  And it would completely contradict what Trump is saying that he wants to do, which is reduce [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=960.0s)]
*  troop levels in the Middle East, bring troops home, not be so embroiled in the conflicts [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=964.6s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=968.6s)]
*  If he signs a normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel that entails a security [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=969.6s)]
*  pact, a NATO level defense pact with Saudi Arabia, Trump will actually bring the United States [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=975.4s)]
*  deeper into the Middle East than any other previous president. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=981.4s)]
*  So it will be interesting. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=986.2s)]
*  Is he going to use the Biden blueprint, or is he going to go back to the previous blueprints [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=987.2s)]
*  that he had himself, which in my view were still extremely problematic, but didn't go [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=992.4000000000001s)]
*  as far as to offer a defense pact? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=996.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, the Biden administration, as you've just mentioned, built on the Abraham [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=998.2s)]
*  Accords, including keeping on Brett McGurk, who was a part of the Middle East envoy. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1003.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure if it was the same position, both across the Trump one and Biden. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1009.2s)]
*  There you go. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1014.6s)]
*  So he kept him on. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1016.0s)]
*  And now, what do you know? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1017.0s)]
*  Photos of Brett McGurk. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1019.4s)]
*  I guess that was with MBS the other day after he's not in power anymore, I guess. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1020.48s)]
*  I'm sure doing the dirty work behind the scenes on a privatized level. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1025.8s)]
*  Yeah, because he's now with one of the venture capitalists who is making quite a lot of money [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1031.1200000000001s)]
*  off of this. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1036.26s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, there's just so much problem. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1037.76s)]
*  And I think, again, if there's one message I would like to get across to your viewership, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1041.36s)]
*  and I'm sure they already know it, is to recognize that there's not a huge shift in many of these [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1046.7199999999998s)]
*  different issues. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1052.32s)]
*  You have a blueprint, and then the question is, it's the same trajectory, but is it at [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1054.02s)]
*  a different pace than before? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1059.9199999999998s)]
*  And oftentimes what Trump is doing is that it's accelerating the pace, but the trajectory [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1062.1999999999998s)]
*  is the same. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1066.58s)]
*  We would have had the same outcomes if the Democrats were in power, unless they, of course, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1067.58s)]
*  have that reckoning, it just would happen slower. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1071.98s)]
*  And it would also be happening while there would be a lot of leaks to the press about [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1074.4399999999998s)]
*  how unhappy Biden is about things, but it would be the same. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1078.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1081.9399999999998s)]
*  Certainly with Biden and that administration, they didn't seem to listen to their base at [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1082.9399999999998s)]
*  all at the time, even though, wow, looking at polling now, something like 8% to 9% of [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1087.76s)]
*  Democrats say they sympathize with Israel more out of, you know, it's either both, but [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1094.02s)]
*  the majority opinion is Palestinians, and independence, that number is crashing as well. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1098.9s)]
*  So there needs to be a reckoning here domestically, but when you talk about it... [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1103.5s)]
*  And that's all ages. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1106.78s)]
*  Yes, all ages. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1107.78s)]
*  I'm sure if you were to take a look at it with the younger ages and the future of the [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1108.78s)]
*  party, the future of the country, the numbers are far more devastating, not just on the [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1113.26s)]
*  Democratic side, but actually also on the Republican side. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1118.46s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1122.14s)]
*  And when you talk about acceleration, Israel is rolling tanks into the West Bank over the [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1124.5400000000002s)]
*  past few weeks. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1129.46s)]
*  The seller attacks have increased, but I guess this was earlier this week, for the first [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1132.0200000000002s)]
*  time since 2002, Israel's formally deploying militarized tanks into the West Bank. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1136.5400000000002s)]
*  Tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled from Jenin. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1141.14s)]
*  They really started this offensive in the northern West Bank just days after that, you [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1146.3000000000002s)]
*  know, temporary ceasefire that Trump negotiated with Netanyahu clearly before the election [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1152.34s)]
*  and then implemented after that went into place. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1158.18s)]
*  If you could just talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the West Bank and how [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1163.1s)]
*  it seems like annexation is the ultimate goal. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1167.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, what we're just seeing again is acceleration of an annexation plan [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1171.14s)]
*  that has been in the works for years. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1176.74s)]
*  It's just that right now, one of the big shifts that did happen under Biden was that Biden [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1181.4s)]
*  essentially took away almost all of the restraints that the U.S. had on Israel. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1187.1200000000001s)]
*  Not that there were that many, but whatever was left were lifted. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1192.8400000000001s)]
*  And the Israelis have been doing more or less exactly what they want. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1196.16s)]
*  And I don't foresee that Trump will in any way, shape or form reconstitute any of those [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1198.5600000000002s)]
*  restraints. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1203.52s)]
*  This is particularly important when it comes to the use of military equipment that the [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1204.52s)]
*  provided the Israelis. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1209.52s)]
*  Part of the reason why the Israelis have had military successes is not because, you know, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1212.2800000000002s)]
*  there's been some decisive intelligence successes. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1218.8000000000002s)]
*  They clearly have had some intelligence successes. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1222.6000000000001s)]
*  But I don't think that explains the full story. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1225.2s)]
*  The full story is we took away all the restraints and the Israelis just bombed whatever they [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1227.1200000000001s)]
*  wanted with no limitations and did things that the U.S. military itself is not allowed [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1232.76s)]
*  to do. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1237.52s)]
*  Let me give you an example. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1238.6399999999999s)]
*  2006, the Israelis twice tried to assassinate Hezbollah leader Nasrallah in his bunker, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1240.6399999999999s)]
*  but couldn't penetrate the bunkers because the weapons that the U.S. allowed the Israelis [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1246.8s)]
*  to use had some limitations, of course, because of concerns about collateral damage and civilian [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1250.68s)]
*  deaths. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1256.48s)]
*  This time around, they destroyed it by dropping 82,000 pound bombs, taking out the entire [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1257.68s)]
*  neighborhood, killing about 300 to 500 people to take out the Nasrallah leader, Hezbollah [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1266.04s)]
*  leader. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1272.6000000000001s)]
*  And they got a conglateratory note from the Biden administration publicly. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1273.6000000000001s)]
*  No mention of the civilian deaths. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1279.52s)]
*  Compare that to when the Israelis assassinated Sheikh Yassin, who was then the head of Hamas [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1282.28s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1287.8s)]
*  They struck his building in which he was in, killed, if I remember correctly, about seven [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1289.32s)]
*  or eight family members of Yassin. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1295.3999999999999s)]
*  So you had a collateral damage of about seven or eight people compared to 500 or so with [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1298.32s)]
*  Hezbollah. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1303.0s)]
*  And the Bush administration condemned it because they believed that the collateral damage was [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1304.0s)]
*  too high. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1309.9199999999998s)]
*  But then the Biden administration congratulated the Israelis when they killed three to 500 [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1311.1599999999999s)]
*  people. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1315.9199999999998s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about, lifting all kinds of constraints. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1316.9199999999998s)]
*  And that's why you see right now the Israelis taking over the West Bank. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1320.3799999999999s)]
*  That's why you're seeing the Israelis now having taken territory in Syria that is, as [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1323.84s)]
*  I understand it, larger than that of all of Gaza, including the highest point in Syria. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1328.2s)]
*  And there's not an objection from the US, whether it's Trump or Biden. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1334.84s)]
*  And there is not an objection from the West with large. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1339.04s)]
*  In fact, there's hardly any reporting taking place about it at all. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1342.8799999999999s)]
*  And so it's just complete free hands to do whatever they want. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1347.56s)]
*  Ultimately, this is going to destabilize the Middle East. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1351.48s)]
*  This is going to bring more warfare and it's going to be bad for the US as well. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1354.3200000000002s)]
*  What do you see as the turning point or one of the themes of like a time frame of turning [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1359.3200000000002s)]
*  point where we got from the Bush administration making that condemnation to essentially. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1366.0s)]
*  No holds barred. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1372.0800000000002s)]
*  And like, I don't know, is it just the increase in prominence of the Zionist lobby of [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1373.68s)]
*  APAC, of the amount of money that they can pour in? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1380.4s)]
*  Like what or even from a foreign policy perspective, if you don't want to speak to it [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1383.0400000000002s)]
*  domestically, where is that? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1387.2800000000002s)]
*  Where's that hinge point? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1389.68s)]
*  Well, I think I would actually put it at the feet of Trump because he comes in and he [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1391.64s)]
*  gives the Israelis everything they wanted that they had not gotten before. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1396.92s)]
*  So recognizing the annexation of the Golan Heights, moving the embassy. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1401.0s)]
*  You know, every president had promised that they would move the embassy from Tel Aviv [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1406.84s)]
*  to Jerusalem. But once they're in office, they realize that's a really dumb thing to [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1411.36s)]
*  do. And they didn't. Trump did it and had this ceremony with Sheryl Adelson sitting [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1415.56s)]
*  in the front seat, front row watching it. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1421.08s)]
*  And then, of course, the Abram Accords, which ended the pretense, the pretense that the [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1424.36s)]
*  United States is seeking a two state solution and went to the logical conclusion of what [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1429.12s)]
*  the US's actual policy is, annexation and throwing the Palestinians under the bus. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1433.72s)]
*  And what the Biden administration do, they don't come in and say walk any of that back [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1439.1200000000001s)]
*  instead. That is now the new starting point. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1444.52s)]
*  And they're asking themselves, OK, so how can we now be even more pro-Israel? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1447.32s)]
*  So I would put it that's the big thing that happened, in my view, is what the Trump [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1451.72s)]
*  administration did in terms of giving the Israelis more or less everything they wanted at [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1455.84s)]
*  the time. And then Biden comes in and tries to essentially outdo and tries to outdo them on [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1459.68s)]
*  the Abram Accords, tries to outdo them when it comes to military support. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1463.76s)]
*  And ultimately, all of this is not only bad for the region, it will ultimately also [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1467.16s)]
*  backlash big time on the United States, whether it is the US's global standing, whether it [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1474.28s)]
*  is down the road terrorist attacks against US targets, et cetera, as well as, of course, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1480.04s)]
*  the risk of a larger war in the region that the US would get ragged into. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1487.6s)]
*  And I guess that's a good place for us to kind of close here is just the notion of the [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1492.6399999999999s)]
*  United States' soft power. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1500.32s)]
*  I mean, Trump and Biden together, I think, have done have sped run this this process of [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1501.8799999999999s)]
*  destroying soft power. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1508.6s)]
*  I mean, you can the Iraq war, you could go back all the way to the Vietnam War, but it's [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1509.8799999999999s)]
*  been a progression of the United States not using influence and relying even more and [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1515.28s)]
*  more on brute military force. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1523.6s)]
*  And I think that has accelerated with unmanned drones and other uses, other warfare where [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1525.3999999999999s)]
*  it's less collateral damage on US service personnel and you can just kind of bomb [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1530.96s)]
*  technologically. That might be a part of it as well. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1537.04s)]
*  But with the USAID cuts and the foreign policy that's been pursued over the past eight [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1540.3999999999999s)]
*  years, and now it's going to be 12, where do you see US soft power and is at its lowest [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1546.72s)]
*  point, perhaps in the history of this country? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1552.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, it really is at the lowest points. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1555.9199999999998s)]
*  We already saw that on the Gaza in which cables were coming in from all of the embassies [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1558.36s)]
*  around the world saying, look, this is worse than the Iraq war. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1563.56s)]
*  Anti-American sentiments are stronger now than they were even back then. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1567.1200000000001s)]
*  And then, of course, you have what Trump has done with Europe and you're openly Europeans [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1571.3600000000001s)]
*  talking about the US being an enemy state. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1577.2s)]
*  Look, I'm 100 percent in favor of giving the Europeans yet another wake up call to make [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1579.7600000000002s)]
*  sure that they recognize that that transatlantic relationship is no longer sustainable. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1586.6000000000001s)]
*  They have to step up more. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1591.16s)]
*  They have to take far greater responsibility for their own security. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1593.16s)]
*  Many different things in which that needed to be balanced out. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1597.0400000000002s)]
*  But, you know, leaving them with the impression that the United States is now an enemy is [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1599.92s)]
*  not in our interest and it's certainly not in our interest of our soft power. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1604.48s)]
*  All of this is taking place in a context that I think is kind of interesting and [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1607.92s)]
*  contradictory because you had Secretary of State Marco Rubio give that interview on [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1612.7600000000002s)]
*  which he said the world is actually multipolar, which, you know, for the last couple of [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1618.64s)]
*  years, that would have been kind of controversial. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1625.24s)]
*  Some people would say, oh, that's a Putin talking point. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1627.88s)]
*  Hillary Clinton was talking about it already back in 2010. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1630.92s)]
*  What was interesting with what Marco Rubio said, however, was to say, actually, unipolarity [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1634.1200000000001s)]
*  was a historical exception and aberration. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1640.6s)]
*  And going back towards some sort of a multipolar structure of the world is a return to [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1645.16s)]
*  normalcy. That's what I think was very significant of what he said, because essentially [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1650.64s)]
*  he's saying the laws of gravity of geopolitics is coming into effect and is making the [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1654.88s)]
*  world multipolar. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1661.24s)]
*  So there is really no option of returning to some sort of a unipolar position, which [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1663.7600000000002s)]
*  is frankly what the Biden administration pursues. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1670.44s)]
*  But if you recognize this, if you recognize this, then you should also recognize that [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1673.24s)]
*  the manner in which the United States could bind and limit and constrain the conduct [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1680.4399999999998s)]
*  of other states during the unipolar moment based on American power no longer will [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1686.3999999999999s)]
*  be at that same level going forward in a multipolar context. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1693.76s)]
*  We simply will not have the power to be able to do so going forward, at least not in a [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1698.08s)]
*  pervasive global way, which means that we will actually have an interest in alternative [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1703.56s)]
*  instruments to be able to make sure that some rival states don't behave in ways that [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1709.4s)]
*  are highly problematic and not just rely on American power because it will be insufficient. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1714.1200000000001s)]
*  Some of those instruments are international law, the UN system, the multilateral system. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1719.2s)]
*  Another one of those instruments is soft power. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1723.8000000000002s)]
*  And what are we doing right now? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1726.88s)]
*  At least we destroyed both. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1728.4s)]
*  It seems like we're going in that direction, not just now, but also prior to that. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1730.24s)]
*  So if you're actually moving towards a multipolar world, you're recognizing it. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1734.64s)]
*  The internalization of that also means that there has to be some severe policy shifts [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1739.1200000000001s)]
*  because we were going in a direction in which we undermine our own instruments of influence. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1744.2s)]
*  Truly lastly, Trita, before I let you go, with the bombing of Damascus, with Israel trying [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1750.8000000000002s)]
*  to annex that large part of South Syria, they've also broken the ceasefire with Hezbollah. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1757.44s)]
*  And we're bombing in Lebanon recently. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1764.5600000000002s)]
*  They did return many of the Palestinian hostages at the time of recording. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1767.3200000000002s)]
*  But what is the status of this ceasefire and how long can it hold? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1772.6000000000001s)]
*  And plus, of course, the escalation in the West Bank. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1777.5600000000002s)]
*  Does that have an impact here with with Gaza? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1780.24s)]
*  All of this is I mean, it's all moving towards explosion. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1783.4s)]
*  I think what's holding it back right now is that people are waiting to see what will the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1787.5600000000002s)]
*  Arab states put forward on March 4th. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1793.12s)]
*  That's when they're supposed to give a response to Trump's Gaza Riviera plan and come up [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1795.36s)]
*  with their own reconstruction plan. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1801.6399999999999s)]
*  My hope is that they don't go small, instead actually counter with an even bolder plan, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1803.32s)]
*  a bold plan that has truly never been tried, which is actually a two state solution and call [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1810.4399999999998s)]
*  for real enforcement of decisions that have been made of international law and actually [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1816.52s)]
*  create a two state solution and a Palestinian state. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1822.68s)]
*  And I would couple that. This is what we have been working on and presented in what we [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1825.0s)]
*  call the Better Water Project. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1828.92s)]
*  I would couple that with efforts to create a security architecture for the region that has [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1830.52s)]
*  to include Israel. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1835.76s)]
*  But on the condition that there's also a Palestinian state that has been created, that's [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1837.0s)]
*  the incentive for the Israelis that would address their security concerns in a way that [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1841.76s)]
*  none of the previous offers on the table have. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1845.64s)]
*  But for them to get that benefit, they also have to then accept that there has to be a [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1848.3999999999999s)]
*  Palestinian state based on the 67 terms. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1853.56s)]
*  My hope is that they would go with something bold, because I think if they want to get [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1857.28s)]
*  Trump's attention, they should go with a very, very bold proposal rather than just trying to [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1860.36s)]
*  meet him halfway on his proposals, which are frankly disastrous if they ever were to be [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1864.9199999999998s)]
*  implemented. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk54BKmprRk&t=1870.04s)]
