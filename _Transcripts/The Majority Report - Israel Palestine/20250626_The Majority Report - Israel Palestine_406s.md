# Trump Humiliates Charlie Kirk
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI)
*  I will say it is a challenge to cover the news with Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=0.0s)]
*  Obviously we had to do some late breaking guests switches yesterday. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=7.0s)]
*  Then we pull some clips. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=12.0s)]
*  Brian pulled some clips based upon the ceasefire. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=15.0s)]
*  Well, first it was the war. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=18.0s)]
*  Then it was the ceasefire. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=20.0s)]
*  Then this morning there's no ceasefire. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=21.0s)]
*  Very difficult to follow the news. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=24.0s)]
*  It's especially difficult if you are attempting to cheer on what the president is doing, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=27.0s)]
*  because at any given moment the president could be doing something different. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=34.0s)]
*  And if your only North Star is to care less about what actually is done, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=38.0s)]
*  but more about that Trump is doing it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=45.0s)]
*  In other words, if you're a bootlicking sycophant, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=50.0s)]
*  this becomes harder and more of a challenge. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=56.0s)]
*  Because you don't subscribe to any rational thing. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=60.0s)]
*  It is all K-Fab and pretending for you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=63.0s)]
*  And you have to keep doing these backflips. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=67.0s)]
*  So which number is this? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=71.0s)]
*  This is two, first two months ago we have Can We Disarm Iran from Charlie Kirk's YouTube. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=73.0s)]
*  This is two months ago. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=79.0s)]
*  Charlie Kirk. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=81.0s)]
*  Because while Iran should not have a nuclear weapon, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=82.0s)]
*  going to war with Iran would be catastrophic. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=85.0s)]
*  Going to war with Iran would be a dreadful mistake. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=89.0s)]
*  And that includes American military strikes on the interior of Iran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=93.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, I need you guys to explain this to me. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=98.0s)]
*  We don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=104.0s)]
*  but it would be catastrophic for America to strike within Iran. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=107.0s)]
*  Even strike, yep. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=114.0s)]
*  Okay. But this clip is back from 1997. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=115.0s)]
*  When is it? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=120.0s)]
*  This is from specifically April 18th, 2020. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=121.0s)]
*  April, April, April, May of this year, June. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=126.0s)]
*  Okay. Okay. So two months ago. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=130.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=133.0s)]
*  American military strikes on the interior of Iran. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=135.0s)]
*  Two things can simultaneously be true. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=139.0s)]
*  We need to exert maximum leverage while also saying we are not going to go to war with Iran. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=141.0s)]
*  Doesn't matter if Tom Cotton wants it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=149.0s)]
*  Doesn't matter if Lindsey Graham wants it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=151.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter if all the US senators in the deep state, Kabal wants it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=153.0s)]
*  We will clearly say we are against a war with Iran. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=156.0s)]
*  Let's play first. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=160.0s)]
*  Let's play first. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=161.0s)]
*  Wait a second, Charlie. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=162.0s)]
*  What if daddy says it? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=164.0s)]
*  What will you say if daddy says it? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=168.0s)]
*  And here is Charlie Kirk two days ago. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=174.0s)]
*  So I'd say the emails are about 50-50 right now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=179.0s)]
*  Support and oppose. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=182.0s)]
*  Now, if you email me, freedom at Charlie Kirk dot com, I want to hear from you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=183.0s)]
*  Please include your age. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=186.0s)]
*  Please include your age. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=189.0s)]
*  I'm curious if the age has any determining factor of whether you support or oppose this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=190.0s)]
*  And you might say, Charlie, do you support or oppose this? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=196.0s)]
*  I support President Trump. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=198.0s)]
*  That's my answer. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=199.0s)]
*  I know the man. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=200.0s)]
*  He's the commander in chief. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=201.0s)]
*  He's the man for the hour. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=202.0s)]
*  And he's had the weight of the world on his shoulders. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=203.0s)]
*  So in a situation like this, I support my friend. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=206.0s)]
*  And he's had my back and I have his. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=210.0s)]
*  Good boy, Charlie. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=212.0s)]
*  And let's be honest, you're not supporting my back. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=216.0s)]
*  You're licking my dirty little boot. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=220.0s)]
*  Good boy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=224.0s)]
*  Lick the loafers, Charlie. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=225.0s)]
*  Good boy, Charlie. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=226.0s)]
*  Look how easy that was. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=229.0s)]
*  Wasn't that easy? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=231.0s)]
*  Look at what you said two months ago. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=233.0s)]
*  It's all over. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=237.0s)]
*  Good boy, Charlie. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=238.0s)]
*  Good boy, Charlie. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=239.0s)]
*  That's a good boy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=241.0s)]
*  That's a good boy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=242.0s)]
*  That's a good boy. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=243.0s)]
*  Who wants a treat? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=244.0s)]
*  Do you want a treat? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=245.0s)]
*  Pay for some more hotels and college. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=247.0s)]
*  Do you want a treat now? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=249.0s)]
*  You're going to get to go to a big college and have a big debate with somebody. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=255.0s)]
*  Stay to abortion, Charlie, okay? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=261.0s)]
*  Foreign affairs. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=263.0s)]
*  Good boy. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=264.0s)]
*  Good boy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=265.0s)]
*  Also, we're not friends. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=267.0s)]
*  I don't know what you're saying. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=268.0s)]
*  I don't like you that much. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=271.0s)]
*  You're a good boy, but come on. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=274.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=280.0s)]
*  Dude's making a lot of money to embarrass himself like that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=283.0s)]
*  Principles. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=286.0s)]
*  Ideas. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=288.0s)]
*  First principles. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=289.0s)]
*  That's what they always love to say. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=290.0s)]
*  First principles. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=291.0s)]
*  Because he mentioned the email thing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=292.0s)]
*  If the email's 50-50, I'll be surprised because his Twitter was 90-10 against inner support. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=294.0s)]
*  He's not supporting Israel striking Iran. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=300.0s)]
*  His Twitter was? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=302.0s)]
*  He did a Twitter poll and it was 89.3%. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=304.0s)]
*  I bet your email may be different because he's probably got an older audience. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=307.0s)]
*  And that's what he's talking about. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=312.0s)]
*  Chain emails. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=314.0s)]
*  Hey, for weeks all we've heard is how Trump's big, beautiful bill will cut Medicaid. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=315.0s)]
*  But almost no one's reporting on a buried provision that would make Trump untouchable. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=319.0s)]
*  Go to ground.news slash majority to see how this bill would block judges from enforcing court orders. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=324.0s)]
*  Unless you, the citizen, post a bond first. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=330.0s)]
*  Highly credible sources warn most people can't actually afford to do this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=334.0s)]
*  And that's pretty obvious. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=339.0s)]
*  So if this bill passes and Trump violates the law, it wouldn't even matter. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=340.0s)]
*  And nobody even knows. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=345.0s)]
*  Which means the GOP's flood the zone strategy is working. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=347.0s)]
*  And it's why I think ground news is the best tool to expose these blind spots before it's too late. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=350.0s)]
*  My partners built the only app and website pulling in news from across the globe, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=356.0s)]
*  then breaking down each source's bias, credibility and the news the right tries to bury. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=361.0s)]
*  And considering most people take the first article they see online as fact, their browser extension is essential. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=367.0s)]
*  What it does is it flags the source's bias and links other credible reports to verify the information. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=374.0s)]
*  Ground news is a better version of how we're already staying informed. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=379.0s)]
*  So I got you 40 percent off the same unlimited access vantage plan that I've been using. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=383.0s)]
*  That's just five dollars a month when you go to ground.news slash majority, scan my QR code or redeem the code majority if you're using the app. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=388.0s)]
*  With at least another four years of this, they're counting on you to be distracted. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=398.0s)]
*  This app is how you stay focused. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pJThanh2BI&t=403.0s)]
