# Israel Breaks Ceasefire By Bombing Gaza And Killing Hundreds
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI)
*  The IDF bombed the hell out of Gaza again last night, breaking a ceasefire. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=0.0s)]
*  This is following the Israeli breaking of the ceasefire terms when they said they were [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=6.0s)]
*  not going to leave the Philadelphia corridor. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=13.3s)]
*  Hamas has been negotiating or attempting to negotiate in the context of this ceasefire [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=16.36s)]
*  for the next stage, and Israel decided they had enough of that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  The reason, of course, has nothing to do with the hostages, because we know from the very [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  beginning that Hamas had offered a deal for the hostages over a year and a half ago. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=31.96s)]
*  It has everything to do with Netanyahu wanting Ben-Gabir back into the cabinet, and he has [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=43.96s)]
*  joined. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  It has everything to do with the right wing, the further right wing in Israel refusing [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=51.04s)]
*  to not have attacks on Gaza, their delusional dream of completely ethnically cleansing Gaza, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=57.28s)]
*  the notion of putting hotels there, or whatever it is. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=70.0s)]
*  Also, it's Ramadan, so the fact that Israel is bombing these folks, and it was, according [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=74.0s)]
*  to reports, mostly women and children. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  There are images of dead babies if you want to find them on the internet from last night. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=84.0s)]
*  But Israel's been blocking all aid that has been coming into Gaza since March 2nd. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  That was their attempt to pressure Hamas into basically releasing the remaining hostages [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=94.68s)]
*  without getting anything in exchange and trying to torpedo the negotiations, because [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=102.84s)]
*  they know that they have the firepower on their side. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=107.44s)]
*  But they had already been trying to starve them, and this was their attempt to accelerate [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=111.36s)]
*  the breaking of the temporary ceasefire. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=115.84s)]
*  Trump should refer to it as the PR ceasefire, because he got what he wanted in time for [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  the inauguration. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=124.92s)]
*  From the very beginning, it has been clear that there was no way for Israel to kill all [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=129.24s)]
*  Hamas without essentially killing all 2 million residents of Gaza. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=139.16s)]
*  And Blinken said as much when he left. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  More than 15,000 have joined Hamas to replace them, which is obvious. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=154.56s)]
*  It was obvious. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=168.4s)]
*  Here is White House press secretary Caroline Levitt. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=171.08s)]
*  Or actually, here is, let's first take this clip. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=175.2s)]
*  Dr. Feroz Sidwa describes the carnage that is in the wake of the Israeli bombing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=179.0s)]
*  Ministry says over 300 Palestinians have been killed after the Israeli military carried [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=192.6s)]
*  out a number of attacks overnight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=196.72s)]
*  I'm joined now by Dr. Feroz Sidwa, who's at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=198.76s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=205.6s)]
*  What have you witnessed overnight? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=207.12s)]
*  So just utter carnage and destruction overnight. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=210.4s)]
*  I was here in Gaza a year ago during the peak of the fighting in Khan Yunis. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=213.08s)]
*  And mass casualties back then looked exactly like the mass casualties that I saw today. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=218.72s)]
*  Mostly children. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=224.16s)]
*  The other half were mostly women. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=225.84s)]
*  And occasionally there's a man, but I'm pretty sure the man has nothing to do with any of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=227.68s)]
*  this that's going on. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=231.32s)]
*  You know, I did six operations overnight. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=233.84s)]
*  Half of them were in small children, probably six and below. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=236.56s)]
*  I wasn't exactly sure that there was probably about six and below. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=239.24s)]
*  Most of them were going to go on to die, unfortunately. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  The I'm told, I don't know for sure, but I'm told that about 40 bodies were brought to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  the morgue directly. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=250.0s)]
*  And but yeah, it was just utter carnage. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=251.0s)]
*  As usual, when you drop bombs on tents, that's what happens. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=254.96s)]
*  Was there any warning that this was coming? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  Not that was given to me directly, but and not that I don't think our NGO knew about [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=263.12s)]
*  it because they would have warned us. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=267.4s)]
*  But but no, I don't believe so. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=269.44s)]
*  In terms of your ability to act, you said you've been there a year ago. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=272.72s)]
*  You've been there for a little while in your current stint there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=278.76s)]
*  What level of supplies are reaching Gaza in general, but your hospital in particular? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=282.36s)]
*  In general, food is becoming more and more scarce. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=289.48s)]
*  I actually haven't eaten meat since the first day I was here, which was March 6th. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's not to complain. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=299.36s)]
*  It's just to point it out. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  We've been eating rice and lentils every day and we're eating better than anybody else. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=302.36s)]
*  And they got us a strip. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=305.68s)]
*  We have money. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=306.44s)]
*  There's just not no protein is available. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=308.04s)]
*  Clean water is also not available. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=310.0s)]
*  But, you know, actually, before this mass casualty event, the emergency room in the hospital [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  was starting to get overwhelmed by gastroenteritis cases just because, again, nobody has any [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=316.6s)]
*  ability to desalinate water to get clean water of any kind. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=321.0s)]
*  So diarrheal disease, nausea, vomiting is getting to be so severe that actually we had [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=324.76s)]
*  a patient's heart stop because of it in the in the ICU two nights ago. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  And thankfully, she's she's still alive at the moment. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=335.79999999999995s)]
*  But again, she's going to go on to die because of the situation. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=338.64s)]
*  In terms of the hospital right now, this the hospital, the IMA, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  Nasir Medical Complex has surgical supplies. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=345.4s)]
*  But, you know, just one one incident like this would overwhelm any any hospital in the United States. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=348.88s)]
*  I was a resident during the Boston Marathon bombing and that it was it was an utter disaster. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=355.56s)]
*  And there was it was one tenth of what we saw here today and what we'll probably see twice today, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=360.96s)]
*  probably three times the next day. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  So it's impossible for any hospital system to keep up with this, even in the first world. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=367.32s)]
*  The the prime. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=372.44s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what there is to say. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=374.96s)]
*  Um. This is clearly just, you know, it's it's it's sadistic, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=378.35999999999996s)]
*  ethnic cleansing, genocide, whatever you want to call it genocide. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=388.28s)]
*  I mean, this is an attempt at a final solution for these people. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=392.76s)]
*  Like, I mean, let's be clear here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=396.28s)]
*  I don't know. I don't want to be inflammatory, but I also don't want to shy from saying what it is, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=397.76s)]
*  because we when Trump said that when he met with Netanyahu, what was it over a month ago at this point? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=403.48s)]
*  And he said one point seven million people in Gaza. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  And he came out with that figure, which I'd never heard before, because prior to the genocide starting, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=413.88s)]
*  it was over two million Palestinians that were in the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  And some have fled. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=424.44s)]
*  But that still betrays the truth that he's probably hearing behind the scenes with classified information [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=426.6s)]
*  is that hundreds of thousands have been slaughtered and now they're trying to starve them to death and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=433.08s)]
*  doing it under a new administration. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=439.24s)]
*  Here is White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=442.03999999999996s)]
*  confirming that the Trump administration was consulted by Israel and gave them the green light. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=446.2s)]
*  Well, the Trump administration and the White House were consulted by the Israelis on their attacks [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=451.88s)]
*  in Gaza tonight. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=458.76s)]
*  And as President Trump has made it clear, Hamas, the Houthis, Iran, all those who seek to terrorize, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  not just Israel, but also the United States of America will see a price to pay. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=467.96s)]
*  All hell will break loose. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=473.32s)]
*  All of the terrorists in the Middle East, again, the Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas, Iranian-backed [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=476.03999999999996s)]
*  terror proxies in Iran themselves should take President Trump very seriously when he says [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=481.56s)]
*  he is not afraid to stand for law-abiding people. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=487.08s)]
*  He is not afraid to stand up for the United States of America and our friend and our ally, Israel. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=490.52s)]
*  And we know that these successful defensive strikes that took place over the weekend against [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=496.84s)]
*  the Houthis in the Red Sea were indeed successful. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=503.0s)]
*  We took out some of their leaders and the Defense Department is set to continue with this campaign [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=506.12s)]
*  if the Houthis continue with their retaliatory measures. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=514.36s)]
*  The president is going to stand for the freedom of navigation of our seas, which is a very basic [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=517.4s)]
*  principle that unfortunately the previous administration refused to stand for. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=523.08s)]
*  And that's why we are in this mess in the Middle East in the first place. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=527.64s)]
*  President Trump inherited a lot of problems, Sean, because of the incompetence and the weakness [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=531.0s)]
*  of the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=535.64s)]
*  But he is focused on fixing them and our allies and our adversaries better take him seriously. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  All right. First of all, they're not our seas. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=542.76s)]
*  It's funny to say that mess in the Middle East and then be like, but it's our seas. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=549.48s)]
*  Well, it's like, is it a mess in the Middle East or is it ours? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=553.32s)]
*  And I should say, and I am in no way happy to remind people, but the Biden administration [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=555.96s)]
*  pounded the hell out of the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=565.48s)]
*  And to be fair, it was in direct response to the Houthis attacking some U.S. vessels. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=571.32s)]
*  But all of this is just sort of like, you know, I guess the Trump administration trying to pivot [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=580.92s)]

*  We're OK with more bombing in Gaza. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=591.0s)]
*  The aggression from the Houthis doesn't come from lawlessness. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=596.36s)]

*  It is off the coasts of different countries, but that includes Yemen. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=605.16s)]
*  So they have a right to implement a blockade to stand in solidarity with their Palestinian [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=608.68s)]
*  neighbors who have no friends clearly in the West. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=616.4399999999999s)]
*  They're going to stand up for them. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=619.96s)]
*  And that is the imperial power in the area. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=621.0799999999999s)]
*  It's it's it's. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=625.48s)]
*  Understand, too, that this really does feel like Trump gearing up for either a U.S. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=626.68s)]
*  attack on Iran or an Israeli attack on Iran. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=634.68s)]
*  There is a real sense that they're laying the groundwork. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=639.56s)]
*  He's decided I'm not I'm no longer I no longer have to pretend like I'm going to do the peace [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=643.0s)]
*  thing. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=648.12s)]
*  Oh, it's peace through strength. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=648.76s)]
*  And by peace, I mean all these slaughtered little children on your feet. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=649.96s)]
*  To your point, Tucker Carlson tweeted something out last night, which normally I wouldn't [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=654.6s)]
*  take notice of. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=658.28s)]
*  But I found it scary that he tweeted basically saying that a strike on Iranian nuclear sites [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=659.16s)]
*  will will almost certainly result in thousands of American deaths and bases basically [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=665.3199999999999s)]
*  criticizing rightly for the first time in his life the idea of doing that with Iran, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=669.88s)]
*  which makes me concerned that he's not getting through behind the scenes if he's saying this [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=674.76s)]
*  publicly. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opS_AD0YZoI&t=678.6s)]
