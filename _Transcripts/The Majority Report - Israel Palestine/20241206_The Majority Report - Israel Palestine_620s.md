# Bill Clinton Gets Weepy While Lying About Israel/Palestine Peace Process
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI)
*  Here is Bill Clinton on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=0.0s)]
*  With CNBC's Andrew Ross Orkin, I was talking about Clinton. I wasn't talking about Sorkin incidentally [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=3.08s)]
*  now [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=9.92s)]
*  for years, but I've been [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=11.44s)]
*  interviewing gosh, I can't [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=14.52s)]
*  leavey Daniel Levy who [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=16.96s)]
*  was on the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=19.92s)]
*  negotiating team [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=22.68s)]
*  In [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=24.72s)]
*  Where was that? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=26.72s)]
*  No, it wasn't Camp David. I'm sorry [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=28.24s)]
*  Oslo yes Oslo on the Oslo Accords that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=31.32s)]
*  Bill Clinton is going to reference here and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=34.88s)]
*  Let's hear Bill Clinton talk about it now remember they deployed Bill Clinton to go to Michigan [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=38.84s)]
*  until [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=44.92s)]
*  Arab and Muslim voters look you guys don't understand what's going on here [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  About Judea and Samaria, and you just need to chill and not worry about the ongoing genocide which incidentally [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=51.16s)]
*  We now have like one of the most prestigious aid organizations in the world [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  and the international very [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=67.12s)]
*  Detailed report on the acts of genocide committed by Israel [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  We just had a former member of Netanyahu's cabinet [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=75.8s)]
*  Come out and say this is ethnic cleansing [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  Here is Bill Clinton saying you guys don't understand still let me go to the Dealbook Summit and talk about this [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  Look I think what's happened there in the last 25 years is one of the great [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=95.2s)]
*  tragedies of the 21st century and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=99.96s)]
*  When I tell the young people [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=105.8s)]
*  for example who are understandably [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=109.12s)]
*  in America they or say they're super sympathetic with the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=113.36s)]
*  Palestinians [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  They've been killed a lot of those Palestinians have and they had and all they know is a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=121.16s)]
*  Lot more Palestinians have been killed than Israelis [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=126.72s)]
*  Yeah, and I tell them [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=130.32s)]
*  What Arafat walked away from [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=133.24s)]
*  And they like [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=136.64s)]
*  Can't believe it. I said, oh, yeah, he walked away from a palestinian state with the capital in East Jerusalem [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=138.64s)]
*  96 percent of the West Bank 4 percent of Israel [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=145.88s)]
*  to make up for the 4 percent of the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=150.68s)]
*  settlers occupied that were beyond the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=153.56s)]
*  borders in the 67 war [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=158.36s)]
*  And I go through all the stuff that was in the deal and they [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=160.56s)]
*  Like it's not on their radar radar screen. They can't even imagine [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  Does that happen and I tell them, you know [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=170.52s)]
*  The first and most famous victim of an attempt to get the Palestinians the state was prime minister Rabin [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=175.8s)]
*  My [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=185.84s)]
*  I think loved as much I ever loved another man and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=188.8s)]
*  So Rabin [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=197.44s)]
*  He dies and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=200.6s)]
*  Then [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=204.4s)]
*  Shenan Paris [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=206.72s)]
*  Is defeated in the election and the rest of it is history, but you walk away from these once in a lifetime [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=208.52s)]
*  Peace opportunities and you can't complain 25 years later when they [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=216.52s)]
*  The doors weren't all still open and all the possibilities weren't still there. You can't do it [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  It's just your voice just cracked when you said that. Oh wow his voice cracked [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=227.32000000000002s)]
*  Maybe that's a sign that he's just talking out of his ass [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=232.28s)]
*  it was the Oslo two accords that Daniel Levy was involved in and I think Taba as well and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  but [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=241.44s)]
*  The easiest way to express and debunk what Clint is saying about these percentages because that was the big talking point [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=243.56s)]
*  Arafat walked away and also to be clear like that door was I mean door was more or less shut but [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=251.44s)]
*  Ariel Sharon [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=257.92s)]
*  Purposely went on to the Temple Mount to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=260.4s)]
*  Spark what was I think the first Intifada? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=267.8s)]
*  The deal that Arafat walked away from [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=273.92s)]
*  And best summed up as you know [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=278.36s)]
*  I'm gonna make a deal about how much of the house I [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=282.08s)]
*  give in the context of a divorce and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=286.56s)]
*  You can have 98% of the house. I [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=290.28s)]
*  Get the bathroom and the kitchen all I want is the sinks [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=294.28s)]
*  The sinks and the toilets and the showers and you can have the rest of the house [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  That was basically the nature of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=307.16s)]
*  Giving 98% of the West Bank back except we control the infrastructure [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=310.76000000000005s)]
*  We control all of the things that make it possible to live in that 98% territory [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=316.8s)]
*  it [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=325.0s)]
*  You I'm sure Sam, I'm sure you're not going to be able to do that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=326.0s)]
*  I know you did students for apartheid in South Africa. I sure heard the term Bantu Stan if I'm saying that correctly [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=329.72s)]
*  I think I've only seen it written right? Yeah [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=336.88000000000005s)]
*  Bantu said that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=341.24s)]
*  basically offers to essentially [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=343.24s)]
*  Create like a state for for black people in South Africa [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=346.56s)]
*  and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  This is the same tactic that is deployed when discussed [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  Discussing a separate Palestinian state defined by [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=359.0s)]
*  ethnicity and race essentially and so [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=364.6s)]
*  No, the the reality is is like that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=369.36s)]
*  It was insufficient and they were I mean, I don't know like perhaps a Palestinian state could be the first precursor [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=373.6s)]
*  To one democratic state from from the river to the sea, which is what needs to be the end goal there [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=380.24s)]
*  But the idea that he's essentially blaming the Palestinians for not accepting a deal that would just have more [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  formalize their oppression and the land seizures [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=393.56s)]
*  Since the 1967 borders and of course since the creation of the Israeli state [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=397.32s)]
*  I mean, it's the equivalent of blaming civil rights leaders [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=402.0s)]
*  For the oppression of black people in this country [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=407.36s)]
*  The you have to always go back to those who have the most power over this and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=410.92s)]
*  It is the United States and its proxy colonial state Israel where the blame lies [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=417.04s)]
*  and you know the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=423.68s)]
*  the thing that he leaves out of this whole thing too is the fact that like [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  The the people who literally run Israel now [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  were the cohort that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=436.64000000000004s)]
*  Praised the assassination of Ruben in Israel [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=440.20000000000005s)]
*  So the blame is all the Palestinians [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=445.24s)]
*  Maybe they could have taken that deal maybe you know [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=449.56s)]
*  Maybe maybe it was wrong of the Palestinian people to [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=454.04s)]
*  not realize that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  over time the US would become [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=461.0s)]
*  less and less of even a [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=464.0s)]
*  Somewhat bias broker into a full-on like midwife of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=466.96s)]
*  The ethnic cleansing I don't know if everybody could see that coming [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=474.84s)]
*  But the idea that there is you know like [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=482.44s)]
*  This is largely a function of you know the Palestinian people [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=485.84s)]
*  Not taking [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=492.08s)]
*  The scraps that were offered them [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=493.96s)]
*  Is it's grotesque [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=496.96s)]
*  It's grotesque. Why does this person have to have any involvement in our politics anymore like [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=499.88s)]
*  You know George W. Bush is doing his little paintings or whatever [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=507.32s)]
*  Mitt Romney was a senator and he just gave some stupid ass [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=511.15999999999997s)]
*  Highfalutin speech as if he didn't vote for like 90% of Donald Trump's agenda before [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=515.24s)]
*  Retiring today. He gave that speech [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=520.16s)]
*  like the Republicans will extricate the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=522.8s)]
*  Former members of their party that don't serve their current interests [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=526.72s)]
*  Yeah, we have to deploy this this this predator this predator who smeared a [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=529.88s)]
*  Young intern who he had an affair with in as the president of the United States and tried to ruin her goddamn life [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=539.12s)]
*  And was all over the Lolita Express with Jeffrey Epstein [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=546.64s)]
*  We've got to like give a crap with this guy has to say get out of public life you you're shaking [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=551.52s)]
*  You're old you can barely hear anything. I was on a beach somewhere ride on that [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=557.44s)]
*  On that top of that plane. I did not ride on top of the plane [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=563.48s)]
*  well, that's I [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=569.6s)]
*  Did not ride on the plane [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=572.12s)]
*  On [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=575.36s)]
*  The plane that's see what I did there [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=578.72s)]
*  Would have been made a great lawyer bill. Oh, thank you. I was [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=582.32s)]
*  Did not ride on the plane [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5UuB-EvYKI&t=587.64s)]
