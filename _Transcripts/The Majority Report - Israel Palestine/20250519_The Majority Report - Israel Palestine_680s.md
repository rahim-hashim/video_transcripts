# Democrat Admits US Is "Complicit" In Israel's Starvation Of Gaza
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ)
*  Israel has turned up the intensity of the attacks on civilians in Gaza, just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=0.0s)]
*  blowing up tent after tent with missiles and now they are moving into the south [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=8.34s)]
*  and again attempting to corral Palestinians living in Gaza into [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=15.5s)]
*  smaller and smaller concentrated, almost camps if you will, within a larger [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  concentration, you know, what started out as a larger concentration project and in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=29.18s)]
*  the wake of Donald Trump's wheeling and dealing in the Middle East over the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=39.66s)]
*  weekend we have a sense of what the deal was and it doesn't look like it was much. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=44.54s)]
*  At this point it looks like what these Arab nations were looking for was just a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=50.9s)]
*  little air out of the tires and so the Netanyahu government has supposedly [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=57.94s)]
*  going to allow a trickle of humanitarian aid in. Here is Senator Chris Van Hollen [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=65.25999999999999s)]
*  speaking about how the United States is complicit in this and is really not doing [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=72.9s)]
*  anything about it as well. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=84.06s)]
*  Right. We just showed some reporting from our colleague Deborah Paddow with [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=85.58000000000001s)]
*  incredible pictures from our shooter inside of Gaza, Marwan. It's hard to look [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=90.58000000000001s)]
*  at pictures of children in that level of starvation. You have said the Israeli [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=96.66000000000001s)]
*  government is starving civilians and the US is complicit in the gross violation [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=102.34s)]
*  of international law. The UN is begging to go in. The Israeli government says they [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=107.34s)]
*  don't want to work with the UN here. They want to work with this Gaza [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=112.38000000000001s)]
*  humanitarian foundation that's just being set up. What do you know about this? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  Should there be US support for it? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=120.98s)]
*  So, Margaret, you're right. It's very hard to look at those pictures and the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=123.78s)]
*  United States has been complicit. President Trump was in the region and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=127.34s)]
*  really did nothing, said virtually nothing about what's happening in Gaza, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  which is on fire. We're in 77th day of a full blockade. Two million Palestinians [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  are starving. This is collective punishment that is clearly illegal under [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=145.38s)]
*  international law. And this other idea that's been cooked up either by [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=151.26s)]
*  Israelis or by the Trump administration is clearly not fit for purpose when it [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=156.62s)]
*  comes to trying to address this burgeoning famine. And all it will do is [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=163.73999999999998s)]
*  further allow food to be used as a weapon of war. So I hope the United [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=170.06s)]
*  States will back off this plan. None of the credible international organizations [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=176.17999999999998s)]
*  have said that they will participate because it violates international norms [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=181.5s)]
*  and how it's structured. And so I hope the United States will back off and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=187.42s)]
*  immediately call today to allow the trucks right now that have food to be [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  able to come provide food to starving people. These air provided by [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=196.06s)]
*  international aid organizations. Is there anything that the United States [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=200.17999999999998s)]
*  can do in terms of leverage? You were you've been bipartisan in your [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=204.38s)]
*  criticism. You said that what happened in Gaza is a black stain on Joe Biden's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  legacy as president. You are criticizing the current administration for not [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=212.26s)]
*  doing more here. What leverage is there? I mean, is what you're saying falling [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  on any ears that want to listen? Well, I've had conversations with some [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=220.06s)]
*  people in in the Trump administration and made clear that they need to do [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=223.82s)]
*  more. One of the very obvious things they could do is President Trump today [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=228.7s)]
*  could call upon the Netanyahu government to let aid in. I mean, the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=233.62s)]
*  president acknowledged their people starving in Gaza the other day. He said [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=237.66s)]
*  so. But why hasn't he called on, you know, Netanyahu to let the aid in? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=241.1s)]
*  Let's just start with that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=247.06s)]
*  I mean, the the proposal that the Trump administration has to ethnically [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=250.78s)]
*  cleanse the Gaza Strip and send forcibly over a million Palestinians to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=256.06s)]
*  Libya is drawing international condemnation, as Chris Van Hollen [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=262.1s)]
*  mentioned there. But the thing that is just so hard to watch is that the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=266.66s)]
*  United Nations is essentially has been begging for weeks. It's been 11 weeks of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=276.02s)]
*  no food coming in. And people have been posting side by sides of the Holocaust [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=281.53999999999996s)]
*  and the Warsaw Ghetto, the starvation there and children in Gaza. You and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=289.26s)]
*  when you talk about concentrating people into smaller and smaller enclaves [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=293.7s)]
*  and starving them, I mean, the Nazis concentrated people and then ship them [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=296.97999999999996s)]
*  to extermination camps. Now, with this kind of 21st century drone warfare, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=302.14000000000004s)]
*  why even wait is the Israelis are basically saying we can starve them to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=307.26000000000005s)]
*  death and then to accelerate the genocide and this final solution that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=311.86s)]
*  they're engaging in. Let's just bomb them to death. We don't know the true [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=316.22s)]
*  death toll. I keep repeating that, but it's clearly in the hundreds of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=320.22s)]
*  thousands. And yeah, I mean, Van Hollen is doing the right thing here. He's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=323.14000000000004s)]
*  been consistent on this and criticizing Biden too. And like when Biden's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=329.7s)]
*  Biden's cancer diagnosis, it's a horrible thing for people to go through. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=334.97999999999996s)]
*  But this broke over the weekend that Gaza's only cancer hospital, which had [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=338.09999999999997s)]
*  10,000 patients in it, is being forced to shut down because Israel keeps [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=343.18s)]
*  bombing it. Remember at the start of the genocide when Israel was claiming that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=347.26s)]
*  it was Hamas rockets? They would never bomb hospitals. How dare Rashida Tlaib [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=351.14s)]
*  suggest that they would do such a thing? Obviously anti-Semitic. They're now [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=356.14s)]
*  doing precision strikes. They killed a journalist in a burn unit last week. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=359.14s)]
*  The Israeli capacity in terms of its military versus, you know, Hamas doesn't [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=365.46s)]
*  have an air force. They can be so precise that they can go into a burn [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=371.58s)]
*  unit in a hospital to kill a journalist. And they admitted it too. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=377.14s)]
*  BBC, I noticed the other day, had a report where they were talking about [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=381.5s)]
*  we will not name our journalists for security reasons. And it's like, wait, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=385.66s)]
*  hello? They're afraid to say the name of their own journalists because they know [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=391.66s)]
*  Israel is killing and targeting journalists. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=398.14000000000004s)]
*  It's the deadliest conflict. And it's not a conflict. It's one side of genocide. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=402.34000000000003s)]
*  But deadliest conflict in the history of records in terms of keeping for [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=406.18s)]
*  journalists. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=411.3s)]
*  And what BBC is doing is taking Gary Lineker off of Match of the Day because [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=412.9s)]
*  he criticized Israel. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=417.82s)]
*  And this is why we were stunning. I mean, can you imagine that? We're not going to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=420.82s)]
*  name the we're not going to name our reporters in Gaza because we know Israel [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=424.58s)]
*  may or will target them for assassination. Yet let's not criticize this country in [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=431.7s)]
*  any way. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=437.86s)]
*  I don't know how these editors think that this is sustainable. Like Zoran was [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=438.18s)]
*  accused of being pro-holocaust over the weekend by Politico because they didn't [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=442.82s)]
*  sign on to announcements saying, I support Israel and we pledge to go there. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=446.34000000000003s)]
*  Like, well, he voted. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=450.78000000000003s)]
*  He didn't co-sponsor that resolution because he hadn't been co-sponsoring [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=453.54s)]
*  resolutions, but he voted to recognize the Holocaust. It's just a smear by [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=458.86s)]
*  But it's when they add it on and say, also, do you support Israel? And that's [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=463.38000000000005s)]
*  what he takes issue with, which he should. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=468.42s)]
*  And the Trump administration, it's important because we talked about this [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=469.98s)]
*  with Jeet a lot on Friday about how he is breaking certain norms with like D.C. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=473.5s)]
*  National Security think tank orthodoxy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  But if he's just breaking these norms so that he can get cash from the Qataris or [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=483.14000000000004s)]
*  he can do some sort of deal with live golf and the Saudis to have live golf [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=490.58000000000004s)]
*  tournaments at Trump courses, which seems like that's in the works, then if he's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=495.5s)]
*  doing these corrupt deals alongside it and he isn't addressing the Palestinian [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=500.42s)]
*  issue in any meaningful way and is, in fact, the Palestinian issue, that's [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=504.42s)]
*  yeah, I shouldn't even use that framing. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=508.54s)]
*  But is is proposing ethnic cleansing. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=510.1s)]
*  Then it's it's meaningless what he's doing. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=513.54s)]
*  It's totally meaningless. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=515.34s)]
*  Well, look, at the end of the day, the real question is, what are the Qataris? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=516.38s)]
*  What are the Emirates? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=521.34s)]
*  What are what is Saudi Arabia asking? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=523.9s)]
*  Like, what's their ask in on behalf of the Palestinians? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=528.1s)]
*  Because the Trump administration does not care. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=532.3000000000001s)]
*  And it's really a question to the extent that there's any opportunity for Gaza [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=535.4200000000001s)]
*  to survive this. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=540.26s)]
*  It is simply a function of what the ask is of either Arab nations. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=542.26s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know what kind of, you know, international common [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=549.22s)]
*  condemnation obviously has some but very limited influence in this circumstance [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=555.14s)]
*  right now. I mean, it has to start being like embargoes and and what not. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=563.3000000000001s)]
*  But you saw J.D. Vance didn't want to be in Israel when they started this next [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=569.1800000000001s)]
*  wave of an assault. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=574.7s)]
*  And, you know, Netanyahu is putting in some aid again. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=576.62s)]
*  Even even the plan is not to provide more than aid for 60 percent of Palestinians [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=582.54s)]
*  there. And that's that's the pie in the sky plan. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=589.78s)]
*  So this is, you know, this is the situation. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=592.94s)]
*  This is the situation. It's hard to know where the leverage points are other than [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=597.06s)]
*  just sort of broadly supporting it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=600.54s)]
*  But I will also say it was graduation season. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=602.74s)]
*  I saw some great young people get up and and despite the sort of threats looming [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=604.9s)]
*  over them. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=613.86s)]
*  Spoke out against this genocide. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=617.06s)]
*  I don't know if we played that the other day, but there was one student from I [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=619.5799999999999s)]
*  think it was N.Y.U. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=623.3s)]
*  I think we put the N.Y.U. on Thursday. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=624.34s)]
*  Well, on Thursday when you were out. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=625.4200000000001s)]
*  But there was a George Washington University. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=626.7s)]
*  Yes, I saw that that one as well. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=628.6600000000001s)]
*  And that was really exceptional. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=631.58s)]
*  They seem to deal with it a lot better as far as I can tell. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=633.22s)]
*  I don't know what they did after it, but at least in the moment, you know, I think [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=636.58s)]
*  I don't know who it was. The dean came up and said, thank you for saying that. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=639.94s)]
*  But it is amazing. I think she might be investigated. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=642.94s)]
*  All of really? Yeah. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=645.5400000000001s)]
*  All of these students at the very least cheering. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=648.14s)]
*  That's this is the new McCarthyism. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=651.34s)]
*  There's nothing no there's no other way around it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=653.42s)]
*  It's Zionist McCarthyism and they're coming for our institutions and for people [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=656.58s)]
*  who dare to speak their conscience. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoSIBGEAFkQ&t=660.8199999999999s)]
