# Tucker Truth Nukes Ted Cruz's Insane Israel Theology
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E)
*  Since we were just talking a little bit about the Ted Cruz debacle with Tucker Carlson, let's play another clip. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=0.0s)]
*  We played yesterday the very famous, widely circulated clip of Tucker Carlson asking Ted Cruz if he knew the size of Iran's population. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=8.0s)]
*  And he had no idea, despite calling for regime change there. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=20.8s)]
*  And we got to use the little glee that Tucker Carlson gets that is usually so gross. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=24.4s)]
*  Like sort of prep school bully geeking out sort of energy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=34.0s)]
*  Right. We got to use that for good for just a split second in that interview because he knew he got Ted Cruz there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=37.6s)]
*  And honestly, it didn't let up for the entirety of the interview. This was another part of the interaction. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=46.0s)]
*  Tucker is basically asking Ted Cruz about his rabid Christian Zionism. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=53.76s)]
*  This was his this was that exchange. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=60.8s)]
*  And the reason is twofold. Number one, as a Christian growing up in Sunday school, I was taught from the Bible, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  those who bless Israel will be blessed and those who curse Israel will be cursed. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=71.6s)]
*  And from my perspective, I want to be on the blessing side of things. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=76.64s)]
*  Those who bless the government of Israel? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=80.08s)]
*  Those who bless Israel is what it's a doesn't say the government of it says the nation of Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=82.0s)]
*  So that's in the Bible. As a Christian, I believe that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=86.08s)]
*  Where is that? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=89.2s)]
*  I can find it to you. I don't have the script tip of my pull out the phone and use the same. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=90.48s)]
*  It's in Genesis. But so you're reading a Bible phrase. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=95.76s)]
*  You don't have context for it. You don't know where the Bible it is. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=100.0s)]
*  But that's like her theology. I'm confused. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=101.76s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=104.64s)]
*  Tucker, I'm a Christian. I want to know what you're talking about. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=106.08s)]
*  Hey, where does where does my support for Israel come from? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=109.12s)]
*  Number one, because biblically, we're commanded to support Israel. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=113.04s)]
*  But number two, hold on. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  Hold on. You're a senator and now you're throwing out theology. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  And I am a Christian. I am allowed to weigh in on this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=121.76s)]
*  We are commanded as Christians to support the government of Israel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  We are commanded to support Israel. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=127.04s)]
*  And we're told those who bless Israel will be blessed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=128.72s)]
*  But hold on. Define Israel. This is important. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=131.68s)]
*  Are you kidding? This majority Christian country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=133.84s)]
*  Define Israel. Do you not know what Israel is? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=136.4s)]
*  That would be the country you've asked like 49 questions about. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  So that's what Genesis. That's what God is talking about. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=142.0s)]
*  The nation of Israel. Yes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=145.36s)]
*  And so is that the current borders, the current leadership, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=146.4s)]
*  is that what the political entity called Israel? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  He's talking about the nation of Israel. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=151.36s)]
*  You had nations exists and he's discussing a nation. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  A nation was the people of Israel. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  Is the nation God is referring to in Genesis. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=156.56s)]
*  Is that the same as the country run by Benjamin Netanyahu right now? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=159.52s)]
*  Yes. It is. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=162.8s)]
*  And by the way, it's not run by Benjamin Netanyahu as a dictator. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  It's a democratic country. He's a dictator. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=166.96s)]
*  He's the prime minister. Right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  Just like, you know, America is the country run by Donald Trump. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=171.84s)]
*  No, actually, the American people elected Donald Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=174.72s)]
*  The same principle is there. This is silly. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=176.56s)]
*  I'm talking about the political entity of modern Israel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  Yes. And that is it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=180.88000000000002s)]
*  You believe that's what God was talking about in Genesis. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  I do. But. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  That country's existed since when? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=186.0s)]
*  For thousands of years. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=188.56s)]
*  Now, there was a time when it didn't exist and then was recreated just over 70 years ago. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=189.68s)]
*  I'm saying. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=193.36s)]
*  Can you pause it? That's actually so interesting. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=194.0s)]
*  That's so interesting that he says that that there was a time that it didn't exist and it [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  was recreated. When was that time in between Genesis and, you know, 1940, 1948, 1947? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=202.0s)]
*  When was that time? That was the time when it was Palestine. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  That was the time when the Palestinians and the indigenous population of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=215.44s)]
*  Palestine lived there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=219.6s)]
*  Who, as people pointed out, like a lot of those people descended from the folks who were Jews [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=221.68s)]
*  back in the time that they're talking about, like thousands of years ago, they just stayed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  there and changed religions. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=231.44s)]
*  Right. And there were also Jews there that were a part of the of indigenous Palestine. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  They were just a bit of a minority. Yeah. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  Just also, that's a very what Ted Cruz is referencing there is a very recent interpretation [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=240.88s)]
*  of that part of the Bible that has become popularized or that became popularized. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=246.56s)]
*  Just in the past, like 60, 70 years in the United States as part of like the Christian, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=251.28s)]
*  evangelical, televangelist revolution of like the 50s and 60s. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=255.76s)]
*  That's the interpretation that was mainstreamed by like Jerry Falwell's out there, the like [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=260.08s)]
*  Oral Roberts, who were becoming popular, the Pat Roberts, as I mean, who can be popular. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=265.12s)]
*  And there's very real criticism from like theologians who believe as, you know, people [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=270.8s)]
*  believe before that modern Israel, the Bible that Tucker Carlson's referring to, which [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=276.88s)]
*  I think is the trap he was trying to lead Ted Cruz into refers to like the followers [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=281.52s)]
*  of Christ. Now, it doesn't refer specifically in the Bible to any geographical part of land. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=286.8s)]
*  It refers to people who like follow like the teachings of Jesus Christ. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=291.84s)]
*  And so like this particular interpretation has been mainstreamed in America, but it is [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=295.76s)]
*  not specifically biblically rooted. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=301.36s)]
*  And I do find this schism that is arising on the right very interesting because it is like, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=304.0s)]
*  I just think that's so funny that Ted Cruz doesn't even have an answer to these obvious [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=310.64s)]
*  follow up questions, not to mention the even more important follow up question, which is that we [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=313.6s)]
*  live in a country that has in its constitution, enshrined in its constitution, a belief that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=317.84s)]
*  there shall be no established religion in the country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=322.16s)]
*  So we would imagine, I would imagine that we would be against supporting any country that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=324.96s)]
*  is an ethno national estate, an explicit ethno national estate. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=330.4s)]
*  So it doesn't really matter if they're a Jewish one or a Christian one or anything like that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  That's not the mechanism or the metric by which we should be like establishing support. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=337.52s)]
*  It should be the opposite. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=342.0s)]
*  It's just evangelical, like modern theology, basically, that says that the return of Jews to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=342.88s)]
*  Israel is important because that's when the you're able to get the get the clock going on [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  Armageddon. There's a good write up about this in The Guardian, but like that Jesus Christ returns, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=359.84s)]
*  though, at that point, that's what's supposed to trigger it in their warped belief system. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  And that when that happens, a majority of Jews are going to die. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  So that's like, as they talk about how important it is to protect Israel and how [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=376.64s)]
*  it's we need to clamp down on speech that's critical of our support for genocide, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=381.52s)]
*  their entire end game is to have a majority of Jews in Israel to die because that's what [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=388.0s)]
*  if they're not believers, that's what's got to happen to them. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=394.72s)]
*  You know, yeah, it's mostly associated with like modern left behind eschatology, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  like the like, you know, movie series that has been made into a series of Christian. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, like the book series that has been made into a series of Christian movies, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=406.64000000000004s)]
*  sometimes starring Kevin Sorbo about how like people are going to be raptured. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=410.16s)]
*  But that's not, you know, that's not in the Bible. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=415.28s)]
*  That's like just part of like the modern interpretation of Christianity [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=418.32s)]
*  that is so much more informed by popular cultures like the D&D Christianity. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=421.52s)]
*  Abortion is very, is also not like there's there's talk about killing babies in their infancy, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=425.28s)]
*  I think in the Bible, if your your wife has been unfaithful or things like that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=434.0s)]
*  But they don't talk about abortion in the Bible at all, nor did I talk about the modern state [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=437.76s)]
*  of Israel. It's just like how American evangel, evangelism, evangelical [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=443.44s)]
*  kind of communities have interpreted these things because it's a Christian nationalist vision, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=452.16s)]
*  not one that's based in the text of the Bible. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=458.24s)]
*  Right. I mean, there's, there's, excuse me, there's explicitly things in the Bible that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=460.96s)]
*  are outright mentioned and banned and saying you cannot do this. But because, you know, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=467.36s)]
*  modern day Christians love their like shellfish or something, they they can [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  And they're cotton blends. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=477.68s)]
*  Aren't you supposed to not be able to wear a shirt that's the blend of two different fabrics? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  They have something like that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=484.72s)]
*  The partitan fabrics. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=485.36s)]
*  We also need to discuss this is, this is all, this entire conversation is in the context of [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=487.76s)]
*  attacking Iran, Iran. And, and the reason we are led to believe as as Americans by our government [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=495.52s)]
*  that Iran is, is bad, you know, obviously, because they want weapons or whatever. But on top of all [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=503.35999999999996s)]
*  that, the reason that Iran having these weapons would be bad is because they are a scary theocracy. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=510.0s)]
*  We can't have a country ruled by just one religion and abiding by that religion in their [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=516.64s)]
*  founding, you know, country documents or whatever, having these weapons. And here's Ted Cruz saying [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=526.24s)]
*  that the whole reason he stands for behind Israel in this war against Iran is because of his religion [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=532.96s)]
*  and his religious beliefs and God told him. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=539.04s)]
*  So it's not scary to be a complete religious fundamentalist psycho because they're white. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=542.24s)]
*  And this is also just, you know, about the essential qualities that are [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  assigned to like the global north and western civilization and the ones that we assign to, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=553.12s)]
*  you know, the Middle East, specifically, but also the global south. Like, that's just a land of [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=558.72s)]
*  barbarians and everything they do there is going to be interpreted through that lens. And so when [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=562.48s)]
*  we do things here, like same thing as George W. Bush did when he was trying to invade Iraq or when [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=566.08s)]
*  he did invade Iraq, he was talking about Gog and Magog and all that other like fantasy crap. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=570.88s)]
*  And people didn't take that as like being, oh, wow, look at this sign of this like [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=576.24s)]
*  religious theocracy that is going to invade one of its one of the other countries in the world [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=580.08s)]
*  because of some sort of like backwards belief in religion. They still ascribe to it material [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=584.88s)]
*  of realities that were driving us, but they don't include the parts. But we were also like [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=590.0s)]
*  indexing like fantasy because that's just not part of the things that we want to associate with like [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=594.24s)]
*  western civilization. It's all very, I think, coming into stark relief as we see more and more [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=599.04s)]
*  people just take things like this on air. I want to take a little trip down memory lane, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=604.16s)]
*  what this Tucker and Ted Cruz interview reminded me of back when Christopher Hitchens was young [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=610.48s)]
*  and before the Iraq war when he was saying like Mearsheimer's Israel lobby book wasn't that [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=616.56s)]
*  Semitic but kind of smelled like anti-Semitism. Not my favorite take of his. He was saying you [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=621.36s)]
*  did do some really great appearances and this is him arguing with Charlton Heston who isn't a [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=626.48s)]
*  senator from Texas who was an actor. But here they are arguing about this and Hitchens really [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=630.72s)]
*  kind of lays it into him here. It has been a treaty. It has addressed itself to no other [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=636.32s)]
*  party in the Middle East that's acquiring nuclear weapons or has acquired them. These include [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=641.76s)]
*  Israel and Saudi Arabia except Iraq. And it has decided to say to the Arabs that it will decide [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=645.52s)]
*  which of their countries can develop which weapons. I can tell you now but you will find out later. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=650.72s)]
*  The Arab world will not be spoken to in that tone of voice. They will not allow the United States [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=655.6s)]
*  to determine for them their defense policies. If you're for denuclearization there's always [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=660.72s)]
*  been the option of an international conference on the Middle East and its regional and political [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=665.28s)]
*  problems and that is the option that President Bush steadfastly refused from August 2nd till [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=669.0400000000001s)]
*  Desert Storm began and refuses now. This is a course of absolute folly. Let me ask a question to [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=674.64s)]
*  to Mr. Heston. Can he tell me clockwise what countries have frontiers and borders with Iraq [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=681.2800000000001s)]
*  starting from Kuwait? Yes indeed I can. Those borders are going to be very flexible I think [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=685.36s)]
*  and Iran and Iraq demonstrate that. But you can when you... Let me come to... It wouldn't take a [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=691.5200000000001s)]
*  minute. Let me come to your comment. Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, Russia, Iran. Exactly. You don't [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=698.8000000000001s)]
*  know where it is in other words do you? You have no idea where the country is on the map and you're [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=709.76s)]
*  in favor of bombing it now rather than later on the whim of a president. I can interject but I'm not [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=713.92s)]
*  sure that the instantaneous command of the geography of the region. Oh I don't know. I think if you're [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=721.84s)]
*  in favor of bombing a country you might pay the contemplative knowing where it is. Do you think [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=726.72s)]
*  that Tucker watched that before that exchange? He's definitely aware of it. I mean well he was [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=731.6s)]
*  doing his whole William F. Buckley impression the entire time and Buckley is his son's name and he [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=736.88s)]
*  was almost... I saw someone pointing out that Tucker was slipping into like a mid-Atlantic accent [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=742.16s)]
*  throughout it which is... It could have been Hitchens or it could have been Buckley. Going from O'Reilly [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=746.64s)]
*  to Buckley yeah. Right. Do we have any more of that clip? I feel like we did we pause it right at the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=751.2s)]
*  end. We can play a little bit more. Maybe let's play a little more. It is just fun to watch Ted Cruz [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=756.16s)]
*  squirm here. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because I paused it. I think we might have a second more. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=760.4s)]
*  There we go. Okay. It's run by Benjamin Netanyahu right now? Yes yes it is. And by the way it's not [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=765.92s)]
*  run by Benjamin Netanyahu as a dictator. It's a Democratic country. He's a dictator? He's the Prime [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=774.0s)]
*  Minister? What? Just like you know America is the country run by Donald Trump. No actually the [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=779.04s)]
*  American people elected Donald Trump. The same principle is there. This is silly. I'm talking about [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=784.4s)]
*  the political entity of modern Israel. Yes and that is it. You believe that's what God was talking [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=788.0799999999999s)]
*  about in Genesis. I do but but that country's existed since when? For thousands of years. Now [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=793.04s)]
*  there was a time when it didn't exist and then was recreated just over 70 years ago. But I'm saying [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=799.04s)]
*  I think most people understand that line in Genesis to refer to the Jewish people, God's [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=803.5999999999999s)]
*  chosen people. That's not what it says. Okay it is real but you don't even know where in the Bible [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=812.0799999999999s)]
*  it is. So I don't know. I don't remember the scriptural citation but let's go to war. Okay I [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=818.4s)]
*  keep it's like Genesis 16 or something like that but yes it's in the early part. The point is. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=824.24s)]
*  All right Tucker you keep interrupting me before I finish my sentence. It's just important to know what you're talking about. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=829.36s)]
*  I don't know what you're saying. As a Christian if I believe in Jesus I have to support the modern [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=833.84s)]
*  state of Israel. I'm not saying that. I'm explaining for me what my vote motivation is. But you okay so [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=839.12s)]
*  I'm just trying to understand you said God tells you to support the modern state of Israel in the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=846.72s)]
*  Bible in some place in the Bible that you heard about but you don't know where it is. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=851.44s)]
*  That's your theology. You're going back am I a sleazy feline again? I mean if you excuse me [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=855.52s)]
*  of anti-Semitism again I will say that but I don't think you will. Wow. I mean it's very I don't see [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=860.4s)]
*  easy to be impressed by Tucker Carlson here but these are just basic follow-up questions to what [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=868.1600000000001s)]
*  Ted Cruz has been saying and we have politicians across our entire political spectrum who will [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=873.44s)]
*  repeat the exact same things that Ted Cruz has said and will say it the exact same way [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=878.32s)]
*  and it's so interesting that they get follow-up questions so infrequently that Ted Cruz is just [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=882.8000000000001s)]
*  not even prepared to answer them and I don't think there would be a lot of politicians who [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=888.0s)]
*  sound just like Ted Cruz on Israel and in your support for Iran who would be able to answer any [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=892.0s)]
*  better but this is evidence that they're just not they're not being pressed on this issue. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=897.5200000000001s)]
*  Not being pressed on it from the biblical side or from the civil rights side. Ted's an example of [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=902.0s)]
*  one I would have expected to have performed a little bit better on these questions. I mean he [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=906.8000000000001s)]
*  was for Ted Cruz is well known as one of the most loathsome people in Washington even hated by John [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=911.12s)]
*  Boehner back in the day who called him the devil but he did have like a history of being a little [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=917.9200000000001s)]
*  bit of a debate nerd at his Ivy League with his Ivy League education that he tried to get people [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=923.36s)]
*  to forget about remember when he did that ad with the Duck Dynasty guys and smeared all that [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=928.16s)]
*  growing a beard and frankly that was an improvement over it was an improvement it hid the chin a little [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=932.88s)]
*  bit better or the lack of chin like looking like McCarthy this is the feline part that he was [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=937.28s)]
*  referring to we'll play a bit of this here. It's interesting you're trying to derail my questions [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=943.36s)]
*  but calling me an anti-Semite which you are. I did not. Of course you are and and rather than be [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=948.7199999999999s)]
*  honorable enough to say it right to my face you are in a sleazy feline way implying it or just [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=953.44s)]
*  asking questions about the Jews. I'm not asking questions about the Jews. I have there's nothing [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=958.96s)]
*  to do with Jews or Judaism it has to do with the foreign government. He almost said I have friends that are Jewish. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=964.24s)]
*  He almost did it. No he does say it at some point. He says it later okay well the thing is is that [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=970.48s)]
*  unfortunately Tucker is actually anti-Semitic like this is this buckle this is this Buchananite [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=978.64s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor green Jewish space laser thing where they're just mad about like [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=986.16s)]
*  the only time Tucker has highlighted Palestinians plight is to talk about the Christian Palestinians [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=995.12s)]
*  who are a minority there but those are the only things he cares about because this is [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1001.52s)]
*  he's a white supremacist a white supremacist and that includes you know not being happy about doing [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1005.12s)]
*  a whole bunch of extra work for the Jews if they're getting in the way of say your white genocide in [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1010.0s)]
*  South Africa thing which is something he told Trump about in 2018 for his TV show. He's a great [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1014.4s)]
*  replacement theory guy which is an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. Not only that but he's also a [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1019.28s)]
*  businessman and I think a lot of media figures on the right are seeing this schism arise not just on [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1024.0s)]
*  the right but across the entire political spectrum when it comes to people who are more well integrated [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1029.12s)]
*  into the economy well integrated into political machines being pro-Israel being suicidally pro-Israel [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1034.24s)]
*  as the cost of living increases in America as people are seeing their opportunities shrink [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1039.76s)]
*  and Tucker Carlson sees just like Candace Owens this is going to be my opportunity to ride this [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1044.8s)]
*  wave of newly renewed anti-Semitism on back of anti-Israel sentiment to the top because you know [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1049.36s)]
*  a lot of liberal outlets will have Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens on the debate like whether or not [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1056.4s)]
*  Israel is something to be supported but they won't have a leftist on so they can expect a [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1060.96s)]
*  certain level of platforming from the the center and from like the center left when it comes to [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1065.44s)]
*  their ideas because that will be a way to frame like anti-Israel sentiment as anti-Semitic for [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1070.0s)]
*  people who are liberals but for you know the vast majority of Americans they're just going to be [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1074.96s)]
*  hearing that like oh these are the only people who are criticizing Israel these are the only [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1079.2s)]
*  people who are allowed to criticize Israel why is that how is that and they're not going to be [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1083.2s)]
*  going to Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson to hear this sort of thing and this is how they're going [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1086.8s)]
*  to take a bite out of not crime but Ben Shapiro's market share. Yeah that's 100% accurate but also [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1090.64s)]
*  for a lot of them who aren't like involved in the media business or whatever there's not a financial [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1100.48s)]
*  ploy here either it's pure ideology this is their chance to win some new converts over to their [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1105.92s)]
*  white supremacist ideology and this is a fantastic way for them to do it I mean [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1112.8s)]
*  especially when you have issues that you know go beyond the usual political [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1120.6399999999999s)]
*  discourse bubbles that we have where people like you were mentioning Brandon people who are going [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  to feel the pain of cost of living crisis and all these other things and while they're dealing [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1137.04s)]
*  with this they're going to see the U.S. put all this money into a war spearheaded by Israel [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1143.92s)]
*  and people are going to be upset about this and they're going to have no political foundation [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1152.24s)]
*  or background to understand the sides here and understand exactly who believes what and who is [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1156.56s)]
*  for what and they're going to come across people like the anti-Semitic right and they're going to [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1162.88s)]
*  see them criticize Israel not understanding why they criticize Israel and they're going to [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1171.68s)]
*  go in that direction. Yeah yeah I mean there's only so much gaslighting that people can take [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1178.5600000000002s)]
*  and they're thirsty for voices that are acknowledging what they're seeing in front of [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1184.48s)]
*  their eyes and liberalism's failure and the Democratic Party's failure is that they have [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1191.12s)]
*  ceded any ground on this front the fact that the we have the it's in ashes the anti-war [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1196.8799999999999s)]
*  sentiment that catapulted Obama in part to winning the presidency the Iraq the anger at the Iraq War [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1207.28s)]
*  that had actual political salience has been entirely dissipated by one I think Obama's lack of [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1214.8s)]
*  trying to hold the Bush administration accountable for being rat war criminals and wanting to turn [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1224.32s)]
*  the page on that and the financial collapse but also accelerated by Joe Biden Zionism the Democrats [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1228.8s)]
*  have lost on this issue and now the only the people that are making these arguments to powerful [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1236.32s)]
*  politicians faces about what about Israel are literal anti-Semites the truth is if we [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1241.84s)]
*  had known back when Citizens United was decided that one of the big things was not just going to [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1249.76s)]
*  be corporate cash but the impact Israel money would have in our politics basically buying it up [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1254.72s)]
*  yep like both of our and not not just like you know changing people's positions but basically [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1260.8799999999999s)]
*  directing our entire political organizations toward candidates who already like Chuck Schumer [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1267.84s)]
*  think it's their job to keep the left in this entire nation of 300 plus million Americans [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1274.0s)]
*  pro-Israel we've talked about the JCPOA and the Iran deal Chuck Schumer voted against that [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1280.96s)]
*  and he became the leader of the Democrats in the Senate after Obama was out of office and [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1287.84s)]
*  you can't support Israel and pro-democracy and anti-war yeah no I think that's a good point [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1293.68s)]
*  because in reality the opposite is true like Israel is a very useful cipher for a lot of things [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1300.0s)]
*  within our political system but for liberals or at least Democrats who need to pretend that there [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1305.52s)]
*  is a strain of anti-war sentiment in the establishment even though we've seen everything [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1310.88s)]
*  to the contrary from them over the past 30 40 years Israel acts as a way for them to you know [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1316.0s)]
*  signal that they have faith that they have rather that they are proponents of the American [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1321.28s)]
*  strategy in the Middle East it's a way for them to advocate for American imperialism in the Middle [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1327.36s)]
*  East without triggering the you know somewhat buried anti-war sentiments of their voting base [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1332.6399999999999s)]
*  because Israel is the Jewish state in the Middle East so if you just say you're pro-Israel even [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1339.36s)]
*  though we know what that comes wrapped with it comes wrapped with the military industrial complex [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1343.2s)]
*  it comes wrapped with the security state it becomes wrapped with like the uh you know the [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1346.48s)]
*  intelligence uh state right but a lot of liberals just see it as like supporting Israel they don't [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1350.8000000000002s)]
*  understand that it's a very useful way for Democrats to show allegiance to that greater [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1355.52s)]
*  project of the United States and you know our allies in Western Europe in the Middle East [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1359.92s)]
*  without triggering the you know the anti-war sentiments of their voting base. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1364.4s)]
*  Absolutely. Do we have more of this or? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1370.0800000000002s)]
*  We do I just want to flash this real quick as Charlie Kirk tried to take a poll uh should we [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1372.48s)]
*  get involved in Israel's war against Iran 10% said yes 89.7% uh no and now he's trying to figure [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1378.16s)]
*  out this way of like he's retweeting Steven Crowder saying actually Trump's always been against Iran [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1386.08s)]
*  getting a nuke so he's actually being consistent which is what Trump's himself saying go back there. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1390.32s)]
*  It's the other one it's not this it's the it's the other clip yeah. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1395.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm sitting I'm easy feline way implying it or just asking questions about the Jews I'm not [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1398.4s)]
*  asking questions about the Jews I have there's nothing to do with Jews or Judaism it has to [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1406.4s)]
*  with the foreign government. Isn't Israel controlling our foreign policy that's not about the Jews. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1411.6000000000001s)]
*  You said I'm asking you. And by the way you're the one that just called me I think as sleazy [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1415.44s)]
*  feline so let's be clear. It's sleazy to imply that I'm an anti-Semite which you just did. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1419.0400000000002s)]
*  No I just said why is that the only question you're asking you answer it give me another reason. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1424.4s)]
*  If you're not an anti-Semite. Can I give an answer to that maybe because they're about to drag us [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1428.3200000000002s)]
*  into a fucking giant war yeah of the same pretext that they did they did in 2003 saying it was going [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1431.92s)]
*  to be good for everybody take care of this guy who's a bad neighbor for us and we just did that. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1438.24s)]
*  Which by the way Tucker was you know fine with midwife exactly I mean semi-literate monkeys I [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1442.5600000000002s)]
*  think it's what he called Iraqis I wonder what he would uh how he would characterize Iranians but [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1447.76s)]
*  maybe we don't need to get that far. I mean Israel just doesn't control our [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1452.72s)]
*  government's foreign policy and military industrial complex does. Like the military [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1456.3999999999999s)]
*  industrial complex controls our government's foreign policy. They've wanted war with Iran too. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1459.6799999999998s)]
*  And really yeah exactly and they've wanted war with Iran longer than anyone on this show has [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1463.84s)]
*  been alive. And they it just might not be the opportune time for that right now because Israel [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1467.9199999999998s)]
*  has become a rogue part of the American military industrial complexes project in the Middle East. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1473.52s)]
*  But like overall this is something that America wants to do which is why Netanyahu started it. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1478.48s)]
*  Because he's like he's tempting he's like he's tempting the American military complex into being [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1482.56s)]
*  like well you know you can keep withdrawing support from us slowly or speaking out against [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1487.52s)]
*  us or doing this Iran deal or whatever you think that you're doing but we could also just have war [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1492.1599999999999s)]
*  with Iran. It's like you you fight with your you know let me fight with your partner and you have [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1496.32s)]
*  you both leave to different parts of the house and then when you come back into the room they have [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1500.8799999999999s)]
*  like a whole dinner made or something it's it's supposed to just like bridge that gap. Yep. He [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1503.84s)]
*  knows what people want like it might even bridge the gap between John Bolton and Donald Trump. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1508.8s)]
*  It bridges the whole bipartisan gap. I mean yeah like this they again the opposition party [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1512.72s)]
*  in the house and senate is led by two men who are on the take who their campaigns are paid for [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1520.3999999999999s)]
*  by Israel by supporters of Israel. Yep. And that's just that that's the people who are supposed to [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1527.76s)]
*  stand up to Donald Trump as he does a war for Israel. That's a more if you want. Yeah a little [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1534.56s)]
*  bit more. You're asking you to imply that I'm an anti-Semite which you just did. No I just said [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1541.76s)]
*  why is that the only question you're asking. You answer it. Give me another reason if you're not [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1547.76s)]
*  an anti-Semite give me another reason why the obsession is Israel. I am in no sense obsessed [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1551.28s)]
*  with Israel. We are on the brink of war with Iran and so these are valid questions. But you're not [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1556.32s)]
*  asking about Iran or the ISL. You asked me why I'm obsessed with Israel. Yep. Three minutes after [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1561.04s)]
*  telling me that when you first ran for Congress you elucidated one of your main goals which is [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1569.76s)]
*  to defend Israel. Yes. And I'm the one who's obsessed with Israel. I don't see a lawmaker's [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1574.16s)]
*  job as defending the interests of a foreign government period any government including the [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1578.88s)]
*  ones that my ancestors come from. So that's my position that does not make me an anti-Semite [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1582.48s)]
*  and shame on you for suggesting otherwise and I mean that and that's low you know it's low. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1586.24s)]
*  So why don't you just answer my question. I'll answer any question you'd like. You certainly [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1590.88s)]
*  have the IQ to do it. Shame on you is cute by the way Tucker. It is it's not cute I'm offended. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1594.4s)]
*  You're you're obsessed with the Jews. He just told me. He just called me a sleazy feline. It is [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1600.3200000000002s)]
*  sleazy to him. What is that anti-Semitic to call Ted Cruz a sleazy feline? Like what are we talking [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1605.76s)]
*  about? Sorry he was rude to you Ted. Yeah I mean come on. He's calling him a little b with a little [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1610.48s)]
*  p is what he calls them. Yeah. But no I mean I think you know Ted Cruz may be a good debater [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1618.56s)]
*  but I think even that just enforces the point that these are not questions that you're asked on [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1624.8799999999999s)]
*  American news shows when you profess support for Israel. When you say that you're an evangelical [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1629.84s)]
*  Christian and God tells you to march in lockstep with the IDF they just go okay good me too. Next [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1635.28s)]
*  question like how much how much of our money can we send them? It's so funny though like to go from [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1641.36s)]
*  yeah the Bible told me this the magical book a thousand years old said I need to support Israel [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1648.24s)]
*  and by the way why are you obsessed with Israel? Like right right I love how like it's so undeniable [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1652.8s)]
*  how absolutely rabid and psychotic the state of Israel is and everyone in America that supports [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1658.8s)]
*  it. So it's just like now their their their final message is like why why do you care so much bro? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1663.6s)]
*  There's so much going on. Yeah it just it just it just is on its surface very weird the way our [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1668.48s)]
*  senators and congresspeople and even just state representatives talk about Israel and that's what [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1674.24s)]
*  Tucker Carlson is highlighting here. It's become so normalized in our media that's been put in a black [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1679.36s)]
*  box and what comments on it but they say stuff like that all the time it's like my first goal [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1683.6s)]
*  in government is to protect Israel. It's like that just does not make any sense even in the context [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1687.44s)]
*  of the MAGA's America First agenda. Obviously we on the left know that that's just like it's a stand [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1692.4s)]
*  in for the American military industrial complex. It's a stand in for Islamophobia. It's a stand [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1697.76s)]
*  in for a lot of things. Certainly I have a hard time believing its actual affection for Jewish [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1701.92s)]
*  people or the state of Israel when it comes from the far right in this country. I think that's [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1706.16s)]
*  ridiculous but yeah like it's it's just not challenged at all. Yep all right guys I'm going [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1709.68s)]

*  retortion. How do you say that? Retorition. Retorition. Whoa. And he's grilling a politician [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1732.96s)]
*  in a way that more purported journalists should but won't but he's also an anti-Semite who believes [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1739.36s)]
*  in nothing. Yep pretty much summed it up. This sort of thing this the fascists being able to [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfMHPiAyO9E&t=1743.68s)]
