*  Substack infinite jazz you can see they talk about here [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=21.96s)]
*  Yes, the execution of a 14 year old boy in a quiet West Bank town. The boy was named Ahmad Rashid Sholi [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=26.28s)]
*  killed by Israel just another [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=34.08s)]
*  life ended by the Israeli government [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=37.0s)]
*  Al Jazeera had an interview may well place in the later in the show of a VHS or NHS [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=40.84s)]
*  Nurse Victoria Rose plastic surgeon spent time working in Gaza quote. I operated every day and most of my list was children [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=47.72s)]
*  We saw a lot of sniper injuries the children seemed to be specifically hit by quad copters [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=54.44s)]
*  A lot of them were shot in the back in the head [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=58.96s)]
*  I mean there were those scans that were provided to the New York Times months ago and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=61.46s)]
*  The Times put it in their opinion section [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=68.64s)]
*  Remember that we'll have the the the mass rape [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=71.32s)]
*  Story on the front page splash which has a ton of holes [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=75.2s)]
*  but let's put the stuff where we have literal physical evidence and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=79.28s)]
*  Testimonies of doctors about how many sniper bullets were to the head of these children. We'll put that in the opinion section [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=84.0s)]
*  We have that entire region in 4k from satellites [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=90.44s)]
*  How much footage the American government is sitting on of IDF members just flying around these quadcopter robots with guns on and just shooting kids [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=93.76s)]
*  Oh my god, it's tough to like, you know, we've tried over the 15 months to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=101.76s)]
*  Convey and play some we can't play all of the horrible images get taken off of YouTube [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=107.76s)]
*  But that's what's going on is flying around toy helicopters with guns on them and shooting kids [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=112.76s)]
*  That's what Israel's been doing for the last 15 and that is my naivete where I just I oh I did think you know [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=118.0s)]
*  Just the documentation of these atrocities [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=124.44s)]
*  We couldn't do our equivalent of a Holocaust in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=128.32s)]
*  2023 in 2024 [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=133.28s)]
*  There's just too much available information. It's all live streamed [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=135.72s)]
*  Well turns out even when the images are right in front of people [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=138.96s)]
*  It doesn't change anything and that is something that I think is such a dark [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=142.8s)]
*  Thought that it's hard to sit with [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=148.28s)]
*  But anyway, I was in a good mood until I started reading those headlines. Holy moly [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H204yl59LR0&t=150.92000000000002s)]
