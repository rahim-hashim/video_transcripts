# Inside Trump's Direct Talks With Hamas
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8)
*  I want to move forward to this sort of where we've been this year, particularly under the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump administration. And I want to go back to what was happening in March when the first sort of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=6.08s)]
*  wasn't the first ceasefire, but it was what appeared to be the first sort of like [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=14.56s)]
*  potentially extended one and process. Just tell us about that. It is since the Israelis [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=22.64s)]
*  unilaterally ended that process, but tell us what that process was and how it came about. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  And then I want to talk about a Bolart, Adam Bolart, who is the special hostage envoy [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=37.68s)]
*  for the United States. All right. So rewind a little bit further back in May of 2024, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=44.72s)]
*  Joe Biden, who was president at the time, stands up in front of the American people at a press [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=51.04s)]
*  conference and says that there's a breakthrough on the verge that based on an Israeli idea [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=55.68s)]
*  that the Biden administration had come up with a framework for a ceasefire that it believed was [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=62.56s)]
*  going to be able to bring a resolution to the war in Gaza. And then Biden and his administration do [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=66.4s)]
*  not veto a UN resolution that happens. They were constantly vetoing all these ceasefire resolutions. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=74.8s)]
*  They sit this one out. They let the United Nations endorse what Biden at this point then [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=80.0s)]
*  was calling the Biden proposal. They go back to Hamas and Israel. There's a little bit of back [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=84.0s)]
*  and forth. July 2nd, 2024, Hamas formally signs with the mediators a commitment to enter into a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=88.64s)]
*  three phase ceasefire deal with Israel that was based on what Joe Biden called the Biden plan. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=95.76s)]
*  Israel then proceeds to blow that deal up and totally humiliate Biden. And instead of putting [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  any consequences on Netanyahu, Biden continues the flow of weapons and then nothing ever happens [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=107.2s)]
*  again. Trump again emerges as, you know, he quite likely is going to win. He starts saying on the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=112.08s)]
*  campaign trail that, you know, within hours of getting into office, he's going to end the war. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  Then once he becomes the president elect, he starts threatening and says, you know, mostly he was [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=122.56s)]
*  saying to Hamas, but it was clear it meant both sides that if there isn't a deal before I'm sworn [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=127.04s)]
*  in and hostages don't start coming home, there's going to be all hell to pay. That actually meant [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=132.88000000000002s)]
*  something. So you then had Steve Witkoff, a golf billionaire buddy of Donald Trump's, get signed on [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=137.76000000000002s)]
*  during the transition to be Trump's envoy. He starts attending these negotiations with the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  regional mediators from Qatar and Egypt alongside the outgoing Biden administration team. And there's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  a famous story where Witkoff basically says he's going to fly into Israel, even though it's Shabbat [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=154.4s)]
*  and Netanyahu's people are saying, well, he can't meet you on this day. And Witkoff is saying, no, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=159.92s)]
*  you are going to meet me on that day. By all accounts, it's quite clear from Hamas's side [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=163.84s)]
*  and Israel's side, had Trump not been elected, that ceasefire wouldn't have happened. But what's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=169.12s)]
*  interesting is that the terms of the ceasefire signed on January 17th of this year, three days [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=175.28s)]
*  before Trump gets sworn in, was almost to the letter identical to the May proposal that Joe [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=181.6s)]
*  Biden had put forward. So there was nothing that changed except for the political pressure [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=187.6s)]
*  that was placed on Netanyahu by someone who wasn't even the president yet in Donald Trump. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=194.24s)]
*  Netanyahu, though, Sam, starts saying, yeah, we signed this three-phase deal, but actually [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=200.4s)]
*  we're only going to respect the first phase of it. And actually, we're not going to fully respect [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  the first phase of it because we're going to still keep bombing them during the ceasefire, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=210.88s)]
*  but we're going to go through the motions and try to get as many Israeli captives out as we can. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=214.16s)]
*  For a month, that's what happened. You had these exchanges where the Palestinian side was giving [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=218.0s)]
*  over Israelis. The Israelis would then release a large number of, at the beginning it was [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=223.2s)]
*  Palestinian children and women. There were 10,000 Palestinians that Palestinians consider to be [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  hostages that Israel is holding. 2,000 Palestinians have been taken from Gaza just for the purpose of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=232.88s)]
*  exchanging them in these deals. So as it's moving along, a couple of weeks into that first 42-day [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=238.48s)]
*  phase, Israel is supposed to send technical negotiators who are going to work out the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=244.08s)]
*  details of the second 42-day phase. That second 42-day phase stipulated all Israeli forces are [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=249.52s)]
*  out of Gaza. All remaining Israeli captives are freed. Netanyahu had said, I'm not going to do [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=255.68s)]
*  this. He told Trump he's not going to do it. He told Biden he's not going to do it. Biden and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=260.8s)]
*  Trump both gave him what are called side letters saying, if Israel decides it's not in its best [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=264.64s)]
*  interest, it can continue the war. March 1st comes, end of phase one. Israel makes clear it's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=268.96s)]
*  not moving toward a phase two. March 2nd, they impose a full blockade. Not an ounce of water, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  not a grain of wheat, no pill of medicine, nothing will enter Gaza. By the way, it's still that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=279.28s)]
*  So then, Witkoff and Boller start kicking into gear because they start to get concerned that if [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu just continues to go full scorched earth, that Trump's other agenda in the Middle East is [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=295.36s)]
*  going to be messed with. None of this is actually about the Palestinian people. It's about two [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  things, getting the Israeli and the U.S. citizen captives out of Gaza, whether living or dead, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=306.72s)]
*  and bringing this to some resolution so Trump can go out about the business of the Trump family [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  business and a little bit for the United States in the Middle East. Let's just be really clear [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=317.76s)]
*  that's what's going on. But Witkoff and Boller then start saying, we should talk directly to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=321.52s)]
*  Hamas. We have our own citizens there. Netanyahu's plan seems to be that it's okay if, you know, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=327.28s)]
*  captives keep dying. So they open a direct channel. Adam Boller, by the way, is one of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  Jared Kushner's college roommates and a very close friend of Jared Kushner, the son-in-law. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=338.32s)]
*  By the way, when I spoke to Hamas officials about it, they were saying to me, oh, did you see how [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  Adam Boller got smeared, but then he was brought back into Trump? Why do you think that is? They [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=347.04s)]
*  were asking me. And I'm like, you guys don't know? Like, you're on an intelligence wing? This is a [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  friend of Jared Kushner's. Like, he's a personal friend of the Trump family. You guys are following [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=356.48s)]
*  me here. That's what they said. They send like Jared Kushner's frat buddy to be the guy directly [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  meeting with Hamas. So, you know, you've got his golf buddy Witkoff and his son-in-law's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=365.36s)]
*  college roommate are the lead negotiators now with Hamas. And the irony is, it's probably like, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=372.32s)]
*  there's probably like somewhere a finder's fee for whatever deal ends up coming in. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=377.92s)]
*  I mean, there's total speculation, but we just saw Qatari, you know, the Qatari's offering a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=384.8s)]
*  $400 million plane. Who knows what deal down the road they think is going to come out of this. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=390.24s)]
*  But let's just take, I want to take this moment. So Bowler goes and has a conversation with Hamas [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=396.64s)]
*  and it creates a huge, and he goes around the Israelis and this is how he is met. This is on [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=403.2s)]
*  March 9th. Let's just start with Jake Tapper's introduction of Bowler. This is a fast, I felt [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=409.52s)]
*  this fascinating because I had seen it contemporaneously, but after listening to your [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=415.36s)]
*  interview, I went back and it's fascinating to see like how Tapper introduces this guy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=419.92s)]
*  Joining me now is the man who sat across the proverbial table from Hamas, U.S. hostage envoy [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=428.64000000000004s)]
*  Adam Bowler. Adam, thanks so much for joining us. Let's start on these direct negotiations with [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=434.56s)]
*  Hamas. First of all, obviously controversial to directly negotiate with terrorists. How much sign [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=439.52000000000004s)]
*  off did you get from President Trump beforehand? And this is just my personal curiosity. As a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=446.8s)]
*  Jewish American, did you have to steal yourself before sitting down to deal with people who are [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=452.8s)]
*  definitionally anti-Semitic murderers? Well, I'll say meeting with. Okay, so I just wanted to like, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  they are not definitionally anti-Semitic murderers. I mean, just speak to, I want to get to the rest [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  of the bowler, but speak, because I know that you asked Hamdan about, you know, what is the basis of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=474.72s)]
*  this resistance movement? Do you hate? I don't know if you asked specifically, do you hate Jews, but [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  but he addressed this. I don't ask that because I'm not a child. You know, I'm a student of history [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=487.68s)]
*  and you know, look, since 2017, the Hamas Charter has stated quite explicitly that the official [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  position of Hamas is that it will accept a two-state arrangement with Israel along the pre-June [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=502.24s)]
*  4th, 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. That's been the position since 2017. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=508.64s)]
*  What people like Jake Tapper and you know, and others who make these claims rely on is a [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=515.12s)]
*  combination of having swallowed far too much Israeli propaganda and statements that have been [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=520.4s)]
*  made over the years about Jewish people by various people affiliated with Hamas that Hamas itself [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=528.24s)]
*  doesn't deny. And if you actually pay attention to what they say, there have been several Hamas [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=534.4s)]
*  officials, including Abu Barzuk, one of the most senior officials in Hamas in a recent court filing [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=539.76s)]
*  in Britain, acknowledging that there were things said that don't reflect the views of the organization. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=544.4s)]
*  You can take that or leave it, but you know, Tapper is engaged in reckless, irresponsible, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=549.36s)]
*  you know, erroneous journalism when he poses a question like that to Adam Bowler. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=555.12s)]
*  It's amazing that that's also the first question too. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  No, but this is typical. I mean, Jake Tapper has been, unfortunately, you know, I used to have [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=563.28s)]
*  respect for Jake Tapper during Obama when it was, you know, drone war stuff. Jake Tapper would ask [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=567.8399999999999s)]
*  good questions. Jake Tapper totally checked his principles at the door on October 7th when it came [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=571.92s)]
*  to covering this. He's been a rabid partisan. He's been part of a media operation that has [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=578.16s)]
*  normalized and facilitated this genocide. You know, these people are not journalists. They've [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=584.8s)]
*  been propagandists in a very dark way for a U.S. facilitated genocide. I think we just have to say [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  that very, very clearly. They have had people on that have said demonstrably false things about [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=596.4799999999999s)]
*  events that took place on October 7th, and they have never, ever retracted it, nor has the New [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=602.0s)]
*  York Times. And Jake Tapper was part of that lie machine that was meant to dehumanize Palestinians. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=606.88s)]
*  But on the issue of Adam Bowler, they then have Adam Bowler sitting there. I talked to Hamas. They [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=612.08s)]
*  found Bowler fascinating. They actually said that he was inquisitive, that he wanted to understand [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=617.28s)]
*  not just the events of October 7th and forward, but wanted to go back. He asked them about the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=623.28s)]
*  foundation of Hamas, about their views on a wide range of issues. They felt like it was a very, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=627.76s)]
*  very productive meeting. And they said, they told me that Bowler kept saying that he really [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=632.96s)]
*  was surprised at what he was hearing in the room, that it's so different from what he had been told [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=639.0400000000001s)]
*  was going to be said in that room, and kept emphasizing that to them. And, you know, they [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=643.84s)]
*  told me something that hasn't been made public. What Bowler told them is that the next step in [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=648.08s)]
*  this is going to be we're going to set up a direct meeting between Hamas and Steve Witkoff, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=653.0400000000001s)]
*  and we're going to discuss a much broader framework. And what Hamas was just stunned to see [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=657.36s)]
*  was Adam Bowler not just going on CNN, but going on Israeli television and stating that Hamas has [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=664.08s)]
*  put forward a proposal for a long-term truce of five to ten years with Israel. So Adam Bowler, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=670.72s)]
*  who is the special envoy on hostages for Trump and college roommate of Jared Kushner, goes in, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=679.36s)]
*  meets with Hamas, the first time there's been direct talks between the American government [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=686.56s)]
*  and Hamas, and comes out of it with clearly a much more nuanced understanding, which is what [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=690.56s)]
*  you need in diplomacy, where Antony Blinken and others failed. Somehow this guy kind of gets it [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=695.92s)]
*  and comes out and accurately says, this is what the position is of Hamas. It was an extraordinary [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  moment. You know, whatever the motivations are of Trump and company beyond it, from the position [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=710.3199999999999s)]
*  of Hamas, they're saying, look, we didn't know any, we never heard of this guy before, but he [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=714.88s)]
*  seemed interested in actually what we think. What's your read on that, Jeremy? What's your read on [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  that? Just the idea that he's not a part of the national security kind of establishment West [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=723.04s)]
*  Executive Group. He is basically a healthcare, like VC type of person. But I just think like [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=728.56s)]
*  there's something really important to underline there. The rod at the core of the national security [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=737.76s)]
*  consultant class that basically was running the show for Biden, who couldn't put string two [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=744.96s)]
*  sentences together, they begin to believe their own BS or whatever they're spewing to the public [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=749.84s)]
*  is so disconnected from the reality that you have the Sigma Chi bro come in and just have some [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=756.96s)]
*  common sense reaction. There's two elements that I think are really important to kind of flesh out, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=764.16s)]
*  is that one, these people maybe have more of a layman's kind of reaction to what's happening [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=772.4s)]
*  here. And two, Trump has this transactional element to him where there's some hope here [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=777.52s)]
*  in the sense that, you know, he has these Arab Americans for Trump that reportedly maybe made [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=783.6s)]
*  some connection. I take Barak Ravid's reporting with a boulder of salt, but I'm just trying to [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=789.4399999999999s)]
*  say that like, I want to get there soon. But just that the way with the Qatari plane and everything [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=793.84s)]
*  like that, Trump may be wanting to look at this from a business, you scratch my back thing, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=800.0s)]
*  as opposed to an ideological Zionist perspective, where maybe we do have a shift there. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=805.6s)]
*  I mean, you guys remember that movie from, I mean, we're all relatively similar generation, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=811.92s)]
*  that movie Dave, where the guy who looks like the guy who looks like the president becomes [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=816.8s)]
*  president when the president becomes incapacitated. And then he has his friend, his personal accountant [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=822.4s)]
*  comes to the White House and balances the budget. It was like, I think it was a 90s movie. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=826.56s)]
*  In a way, I get some bad news for you about everybody in this office, except for me. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  But in terms of like being aware of anything in the 90s, but go ahead. All right. All right. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=834.4s)]
*  My apologies. I was trying to do dinners toward you, Sam, but it's okay. No, no, me. That's, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=839.52s)]
*  that was late in my life. When those relatively, which are sort of, I was talking about these guys [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=843.92s)]
*  are too young for that. They don't remember. Maybe Emma's parents told her about this movie. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=849.1199999999999s)]
*  Totally embarrassing moment for me. I apologize. I've outed myself, but it's a movie basically [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=853.84s)]
*  about what happens if a normal person is, is, is, is put in charge of the United States and has to [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=858.16s)]
*  figure out like the problems of the day. And in a way, if, if like ordinary common sense people [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=862.64s)]
*  sit in a room and they, and they're sort of listening, they try it, they, they come up with [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=868.08s)]
*  a different set of ideas than the class of people that Emma's referring to the people that are paid [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=871.68s)]
*  by the makers of tanks to think, you know, like that go in and out of government and think tank [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=876.64s)]
*  world, like the Blinkens of the world, you know, or the consulting world or whatever. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=881.44s)]
*  Let's listen to two minutes of this, of Bowler, because this comes out in these two minutes or so [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=885.44s)]
*  when he's talking to Jake Tapper. Now, of course, in the days after this interview, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  Bowler was attacked and really- Well, the Israelis go nuts and Republican [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=896.72s)]
*  senators then start to say to Trump, you know, we want him gone. And it seemed like they were [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=900.24s)]
*  going to kick him under the bus, but then Trump was like, no, actually, and while we're talking, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=905.36s)]
*  Bowler's on his way to go and do more negotiation. Well, that's, I want to get to that, but let's look at this clip. This is from, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=909.52s)]
*  again, from March 9th, that same interview. Situation, I do think there's hope. I think [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=913.52s)]
*  that Israel has done a wonderful, masterful job eliminating Hamas, Hezbollah, a number of other [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=918.72s)]
*  enemies in the state that makes things possible that weren't possible before. And I think you [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=926.4s)]
*  could see something like a long-term truce where we forgive prisoners, where Hamas lays down their [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=931.52s)]
*  arms, where they agree they're not part of the political party going forward. I think that's a [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=938.16s)]
*  reality. It's real close. Do you have plans to sit down with Hamas again? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=942.9599999999999s)]
*  You never know. You know, sometimes you're in the area and you drop by. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=949.76s)]
*  All right. It's a very unique pop-in. We got to go back. I want to get to the part where [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=955.1999999999999s)]
*  the Israelis were upset. Maybe it was a little bit earlier than this. I'm sorry. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=960.48s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry. I don't know where it was. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=965.12s)]
*  To help other Americans. And so it comes part and parcel of the job. I knew that I was going to meet [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=968.32s)]
*  Hamas as a result of it, and we discussed it. Then I think when you walk and you sit in front [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=973.12s)]
*  of somebody and you know what they've done, it's hard not to think of it. I wouldn't say it's the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=980.88s)]
*  most productive. The most productive is to realize that every piece of a person is a human and to [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=987.6s)]
*  identify with the human elements of those people and then build from there. But it definitely feels [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=993.52s)]
*  a little odd knowing what they really are. So thank you for your candor. So you did get [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1000.4s)]
*  sign off from President Trump ahead of time though? Of course. Yeah. What was the result [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1006.24s)]
*  of the meeting? How close are you to a deal to get the American hostages living and dead, murdered? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1011.92s)]
*  Okay, I guess I jump forward again. I'm sorry. I just jumped forward to 250. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1018.56s)]
*  The Ron Dermer part. Yeah, exactly. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1022.48s)]
*  That's a very unique pop-in, I suppose. So you talked about the job Israel has done in trying to [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1028.56s)]
*  negotiate the release of the hostages living and dead. Axios's reporter, Barak Ravid, is reporting [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1035.84s)]
*  the top Israeli official, Ron Dermer, strongly discouraged you from talking directly with Hamas. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1042.72s)]
*  He said it was a tense phone call. Tell us about that. Do you understand why Netanyahu, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1048.0s)]
*  Dermer, others might be upset? I do understand. I spoke with Ron and I'm sympathetic. He has [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1053.04s)]
*  someone that he doesn't know well, making direct contact with Hamas. Maybe I would see them and [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1060.96s)]
*  say, look, they don't have horns growing out of their head. They're actually guys like us. They're [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1066.56s)]
*  pretty nice guys. So he doesn't know me. And there are big stakes. He lives in a country where, if [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1070.96s)]
*  it sets certain precedents, then it will hurt or help a lot of other people. So I understand the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1077.84s)]
*  consternation and the concern, and I wasn't upset. At the same time, we're the United States. We're [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1083.28s)]
*  not an agent of Israel. We have specific interests at play. And we did communicate back and forth. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1090.3999999999999s)]
*  We had very specific parameters by which we fell. And the reality is what I wanted to do is jump [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1097.36s)]
*  start some negotiations that were in a very fragile place. And I wanted to say to Hamas, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1103.6s)]
*  what is the end game that you want here? Not the dream end game. But what do you think is [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1109.52s)]
*  realistic at this point? Because until we know that, it's very hard to reach some sort of truce [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1114.8799999999999s)]
*  or some sort of end to hostility. So in the end, I think it was a very helpful meeting. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1121.28s)]
*  It was very helpful to hear some back and forth. But I think Israel knows, walking out of that, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1126.9599999999998s)]
*  it's not like Hamas got the world because I thought they were a bunch of nice guys. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1133.6000000000001s)]
*  All right. I mean, that's fascinating because first of all, you never heard an American official [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1138.16s)]
*  talk like that. And he is obviously very, he's being very diplomatic. But what he's saying is [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1144.0s)]
*  they don't have horns. I could have conversations with these guys. They have an agenda. They have [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1152.0s)]
*  an end game as well. What is subsequent to that? I mean, that moment I found fascinating. And the [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1158.24s)]
*  Israelis really sort of tip their hand here. You can't go and talk to them because we have a [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1167.68s)]
*  narrative that we're trying to control. And you're usurping that narrative. But I mean, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1173.92s)]
*  this is the thing. I am totally clear on who Donald Trump is. And I think Hamas is very clear [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1179.84s)]
*  on what Donald Trump is regarding Israel. They understand that this administration is just [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1187.92s)]
*  completely filled with Zionists. They understand that the appointment of Mike Huckabee, a fanatical [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1192.24s)]
*  Christian supremacist lunatic, is now the U.S. ambassador to Israel. They know that Trump may [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1196.72s)]
*  well tell Netanyahu, will support full annexation of the West Bank. They're clear on all of that. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1204.3200000000002s)]
*  But where they see opportunity is in the form of Trump's unorthodox nature. The fact that there is [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1210.24s)]
*  really open corruption in this administration, that Trump wants to make a bunch of deals with [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1216.24s)]
*  Arab nations that actually want this war to end, that it's in play in a way it never would have [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1221.44s)]
*  been when you have a ghoulish 50-year radical Zionist like Joe Biden in the White House who [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1226.96s)]
*  spent his entire career supporting Israel at its most violent and most extreme. From their perspective, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1233.6s)]
*  it's like these guys are kind of normal people. Like they said the same thing about Adam Boller [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1239.04s)]
*  that he's saying about them, that we actually find them reasonable to deal with. They don't believe [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1244.16s)]
*  they're going to get the farm from Donald Trump. They want what they feel is a fair shot and they [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1248.8s)]
*  think they have a better chance of getting it with Boller and Witkoff. I mean that's, we are now in a [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1252.8799999999999s)]
*  situation, it's so pathetic and also amusing at the same time, that the best hope we have maybe [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1258.08s)]
*  for some end to this genocide is that Donald Trump's unorthodox way of approaching things, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1264.6399999999999s)]
*  the people that he's put in charge of these negotiations not being professional politicians [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1271.12s)]
*  from the consultancy class, and Trump's corruption and prioritization beyond just supporting Zionism [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1275.36s)]
*  could end up ending this thing. This is so crazy that that's true. Trump believes in one thing and [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1282.7199999999998s)]
*  that is how much is going to be put into his pocket. I think like, at the very least, if you [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1288.9599999999998s)]
*  know you're not, there's something transactional, then there's perhaps a transaction that can happen. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1297.36s)]
*  All right, so bring it to today. We have a situation where subsequent to that, that a [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1304.16s)]
*  hostage, that prisoner was released and they were supposed to go to Qatar and meet Trump there. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1310.56s)]
*  Qatar meanwhile has given, like what's going on now, and this involves Saudi Arabia too, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1319.92s)]
*  from your perspective and what you gleaned, what is going on right now? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1326.6399999999999s)]
*  So what happened is that since those meetings with Bowler, Hamas has said that they're interested in [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1332.48s)]
*  freeing Edan Alexander, this kid from New Jersey who joined the Israeli military and was captured [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1339.12s)]
*  by Palestinian fighters in Israeli military uniform. I keep repeating that because people [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1344.6399999999999s)]
*  say it's a hostage as though he was one of the people taken from the music festival when he was [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1349.76s)]
*  actually a combatant in the Israeli military. So Hamas originally though wanted to make that part [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1353.68s)]
*  of a deal that brought them back to the original framework that contemplates full Israeli withdrawal [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1358.88s)]
*  and an end to the genocide. I think that what they, the calculus from Hamas's perspective is [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1364.48s)]
*  we're taking a gamble here. We're going to release the only male soldier that we've released since [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1370.8s)]
*  October 7th, 2023 to the United States for nothing on paper and nothing in return, you know, in terms [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1376.16s)]
*  of a guarantee or a stamp on it. And what their perspective is, is that Trump's, and I think that [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1383.04s)]
*  Trump's people indicated to Hamas in these discussions that they intend to put a lot of [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1388.3999999999999s)]
*  pressure on Netanyahu. Whether or not that's going to pan out, it's a huge gamble from Hamas's [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1393.6s)]
*  perspective. The only card, so to speak, that they have is the captives that they're holding. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1398.6399999999999s)]
*  Every time they release a captive to Israel or in this case, the United States, their bargaining [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1403.44s)]
*  power gets reduced. That's how they think of this. That if they didn't hold those captives, then there [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1409.6s)]
*  would be nothing to encourage the United States or any other country to put pressure on Israel. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1415.1999999999998s)]
*  So we're in that situation. Trump though is in the Middle East wanting money, wanting to make deals. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1420.6399999999999s)]
*  This has nothing to do with Netanyahu. He wants to make that money and when making that money [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1426.9599999999998s)]
*  comes into conflict because Netanyahu is intent on just continuing his genocide, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1433.6799999999998s)]
*  in the case of someone like Biden, no problem. In the case of someone like Trump, you're messing [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1439.28s)]
*  with my money. And I think that's really, to put it in just kind of the most basic human terms, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1443.44s)]
*  I think that is part of what we're seeing here. Regarding Qatar, it's interesting. Qatar is, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1447.76s)]
*  on the one hand, at the center of a huge scandal, Qatar gate for Netanyahu right now internally in [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1453.2s)]
*  Israel. And Qatar also has close diplomatic relations with Hamas. It also has relations with [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1458.56s)]
*  Israel and regularly meets with Israeli intelligence and has been one of the primary [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1466.32s)]
*  mediators in these negotiations over the Gaza war. But beyond that, Qatar wants to make a play to be [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1471.04s)]
*  viewed as the kind of logical American diplomatic ally in the Middle East and a close business [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1477.28s)]
*  partner of the American capitalist class. So that is Qatar's view. And the airplane thing, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1483.2s)]
*  you wouldn't give that airplane to Joe Biden. You would do other deals with Joe Biden, but that's [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1490.6399999999999s)]
*  the language of Donald Trump. So from a Qataris perspective, they're like, okay, well, these are [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1494.8s)]
*  the rules of the game. The Trump's people say it's legal. Here you go. Here's your $400 million [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1498.3999999999999s)]
*  luxury jet, you know, luxury plane. The other language of Donald Trump was hinted in this [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1502.56s)]
*  clip here where he said at the end, we're America. I'm paraphrasing it to a certain degree. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1507.84s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Where there's this discomfort with Israel, with the tail wagging the dog, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1517.12s)]
*  to an extent here that... Oh, you're right. I think Trump doesn't like Netanyahu at all. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1523.92s)]
*  Now Fox News is reporting that. Yeah. Yeah. I think he finds him a tacky, annoying person he [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1530.4s)]
*  just has to deal with. Separate Netanyahu from Israel and the fact that Trump's primary, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1537.28s)]
*  his top benefactor, Mariam Adelson, $100 million, he has to kind of do her bidding to an extent. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1542.48s)]
*  But I think there's a lot of evidence to suggest that Trump finds Netanyahu garish, annoying, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1550.32s)]
*  doesn't want him around, probably doesn't like how he dresses or whatever. He doesn't like the way [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1555.9199999999998s)]
*  he chooses food. Those things actually matter in Trump world. And weirdly, there are indications [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1560.8799999999999s)]
*  that Trump sort of likes Mahmoud Abbas, even though most Palestinians don't like Mahmoud Abbas. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1566.8799999999999s)]
*  So one thing to look out for here is that Abbas, who is technically kind of in control of Palestine [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1571.4399999999998s)]
*  because he's the head of the Palestinian Authority, there may be meetings with Trump in these days [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1577.28s)]
*  involving Abbas. And I wouldn't be surprised if we started to hear that Trump's people want to make [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1582.32s)]
*  a deal involving Mahmoud Abbas to resolve the war in Gaza. And that could be that he goes behind the [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1588.08s)]
*  back of both Israel and kind of Hamas to just sort of say, here's what we're doing. But Emma, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1595.68s)]
*  you're hitting it on the head. Trump is an American nationalist in his own imagination and [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1599.84s)]
*  America first. And I don't think he has any problem saying to Netanyahu, we don't take orders [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1604.96s)]
*  from you. And that's not something that democratic presidents typically say. He's not going into [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1610.0s)]
*  Jerusalem. And the fact that this IDF soldier was an American, I think is really key to his conception [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1615.3600000000001s)]
*  of himself as an American nationalist, that he went around the Israelis. And in terms of what [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1621.76s)]
*  Hamas got in exchange for it, they got the good ear of Donald Trump for they got to say, we made [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1627.44s)]
*  a deal with you, we'd scratch your back. So you have to scratch ours in the way that this Arab [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1633.84s)]
*  Americans for Trump story is kind of recirculating here where there's one thing, Trump is transactional. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1638.9599999999998s)]
*  He put RFK in as Health and Human Services Secretary when everyone thinks he's a crank, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1645.6s)]
*  because he felt that he delivered a specific coalition for him in the election. And I think [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1650.56s)]
*  that's where we're at here, where Trump does feel like there's some transactional value in going [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1655.04s)]
*  around the Israelis from a political perspective. And that is where we may have an opportunity in [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1661.84s)]
*  my view. But remember, remember the backdrop of all of this that we've seen, which is totally [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1668.56s)]
*  extraordinary. Trump designates within days or a couple of weeks of coming back to the presidency, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1673.6s)]
*  he designates Ansar Allah, the Houthis in Yemen, as a full foreign terrorist organization. Joe Biden [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1679.1999999999998s)]
*  had walked that back a bit because they thought that there could be some diplomatic resolution. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1684.8s)]
*  So Trump does that designation. But then the US starts doing this heavy bombing of Yemen. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1689.28s)]
*  And you have the Pete Haig Sett signal scandal, etc. And the fact is that the truth is that Ansar [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1695.68s)]
*  Allah was actually sticking it to the United States. They shot down record numbers of American drones. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1702.0s)]
*  The US could not, this is a mountainous terrain. I've spent a good bit of time in Yemen. It is [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1706.6399999999999s)]
*  almost impossible for the United States to destroy their missile production capability. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1712.56s)]
*  They tried repeatedly, and they just couldn't do it. So eventually, Trump's people recognize [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1716.56s)]
*  this isn't in our interest. They sign a ceasefire deal with Ansar Allah, a foreign terrorist [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1722.96s)]
*  organization that Trump designated as one of the first foreign policy moves he made coming back [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1730.48s)]
*  into the White House. They make this deal brokered by Oman, and they cut Israel out of it. Do people [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1735.12s)]
*  understand what this means? Ansar Allah is saying, we will not attack American ships anymore, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1740.72s)]
*  but we're going to continue to bomb Israel. We're going to continue to attack Israeli ships. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1746.88s)]
*  That's the deal Donald Trump made. Some of his base, they're losing their minds over this. Netanyahu [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1750.72s)]
*  is losing his mind over this, that Trump made that deal. Trump is now negotiating directly with Iran. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1757.04s)]
*  Now Trump blew up the best deal that we had to try to ward off any kind of war with Iran that was [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1763.84s)]
*  signed under the Obama administration, and he may take us back to almost identical to what Obama [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1770.32s)]
*  had negotiated. But setting that aside and recognizing there's ego at play, it's extraordinary. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1776.08s)]
*  The Israelis don't want him doing this with Iran. The Israelis have always played a huge role in [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1782.08s)]
*  dictating American policy on Iran. They certainly didn't want them signing a ceasefire agreement [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1786.08s)]
*  with Ansar Allah. They certainly didn't want Adam Bowler and Steve Witkoff to be talking directly [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1789.84s)]
*  with Hamas. So whatever anybody thinks about Donald Trump, in the whole scope of American empire, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1794.56s)]
*  there maybe is a better shake for some of these things under these guys, golf buddies and college [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1801.12s)]
*  roommates, than there was under the professional adults in the room that we were told were the [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1806.48s)]
*  answer to our problems. Witkoff was just in the news in the Jerusalem Post reporting that he [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1810.48s)]
*  had a meeting with the hostage families, and Witkoff said we want to bring the hostages home, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1818.64s)]
*  but Israel not willing to end the war. And the hostages and the families of those Israeli captives [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1825.2s)]
*  said to Steve Witkoff in that meeting, Sam, that what you're saying is something that Netanyahu [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1831.52s)]
*  will never say to us. That we don't hear this from Netanyahu. That those families believe, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1837.2s)]
*  and I think rightly so, that Netanyahu has prioritized the extermination of Palestinian [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1845.0400000000002s)]
*  women and kids in tents with US weapons over the freeing of their own people. Like, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1850.0s)]
*  Witkoff and Bowler, they know the truth. And the truth is that Hamas is ready this moment [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1856.96s)]
*  to make a deal that releases every single captive immediately. That's the deal on the table from [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1862.0s)]
*  Hamas's perspective, and Netanyahu has been blowing it up. And that involves a five to seven year [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1867.68s)]
*  truce where there would be, and they would give up their leverage essentially with really no way of [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1873.12s)]
*  assuring that outside of this type of commitment. All right, last question is I know you got to go. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1883.92s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, where are they? Because they were about to sign these accords. It seemed like [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1890.0s)]
*  Biden was en route to that. They now seem to have like, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1897.04s)]
*  not necessarily recommitted, but they seem to be more, they're paying attention more to the [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1905.12s)]
*  situation in Gaza. I would imagine that's a function of domestic and sort of pan Arab pressures. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1910.24s)]
*  Where, like, what is it that MBS needs? I actually think the Saudis have benefited from [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1919.04s)]
*  this situation tremendously because normalization with Israel is incredibly unpopular among Arab [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1928.16s)]
*  populations. These rulers have been engaging in these deals. There's unrest that's brewing. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1936.56s)]
*  It's not that there's going to be that the Saudi kingdom is going to fall tomorrow or that the King [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1942.0s)]
*  of Jordan is going to fall, but there's an anger brewing in the streets. There's a resentment of [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1946.24s)]
*  these kinds of deals, especially as people have watched the incineration of tens of thousands of [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1950.96s)]
*  Palestinians over these 19 months. And the Saudis were under an enormous amount of pressure not to [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1957.84s)]
*  normalize with Israel just based on broader Arab public opinion. So Netanyahu doing the Gaza genocide [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1964.16s)]
*  and mass murdering Palestinians and blowing up all of these deals and then having Trump come back [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1971.76s)]
*  into power, I think the Saudis sat back and they said, wait a minute, we don't have to talk about [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1977.68s)]
*  normalizing with Israel right now because Israel is committing a genocide. The U.S. is facilitating [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1982.32s)]
*  that genocide. We have Trump coming back in who was asking us for a trillion dollars, who wants [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1987.2s)]

*  up for future and ongoing deals. And so I think the Saudis look at this and they feel like we're [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=1997.52s)]
*  in a great position here because we can push normalization to the side of it. We don't have to [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=2002.6399999999999s)]
*  worry about that. The U.S. under Trump may sign some bilateral agreements with us that Biden wanted [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=2007.84s)]
*  to be linked to normalization with Israel and that Israel wanted linked to it. So I think the Saudis [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=2013.04s)]
*  and the Qataris are huge. They're winning the game right now because of this combination of factors. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSVg50pBk8&t=2018.8s)]
