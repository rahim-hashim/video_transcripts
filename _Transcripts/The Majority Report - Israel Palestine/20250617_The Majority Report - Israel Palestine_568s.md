# ⚠️ Greta Thunberg's Warning ⚠️
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8)
*  Greta Thunberg, I try to say it the Swedish way, but I feel stupid every time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=0.0s)]
*  But I'm trying to give her the respect she deserves because like we're seeing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=6.54s)]
*  somebody who's like a historic activist [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=12.22s)]
*  and like a figure that is really changing the world when she's only 22 years old. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=15.16s)]
*  And it's incredible to witness. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=20.72s)]
*  I'm inspired by her singular focus on injustice [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=24.72s)]
*  and on capitalism and on climate change. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=29.14s)]
*  And she's talked about this before, like how her autism is her superpower [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=34.24s)]
*  because it's given her the ability to have such intense interests. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=39.18s)]
*  And that's just something that sticks with me all the time, just about like [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=43.22s)]
*  how our neurodivergent friends can contribute in such meaningful, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=47.0s)]
*  impactful ways to our discourse because of the different way that they see the world. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=52.900000000000006s)]
*  And, you know, you can have an Elon Musk. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=57.4s)]
*  This doesn't mean you're automatically somebody who will have compassion for others. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=59.46s)]
*  But it's just like I think highlights the specificity of her voice [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=63.5s)]
*  and why she's able to cut through the BS and doesn't fall [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=67.5s)]
*  for traditional media narratives and questioning this whole press conference, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=71.98s)]
*  which is around 13 minutes when she immediately got off the plane [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=76.28s)]
*  that the Israelis put her on, she landed back in Paris again to recap. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=80.02s)]
*  She and around a dozen other activists [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=85.44s)]
*  were on a flotilla, which was a seven day trip, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=89.72s)]
*  trying to get to the Gaza Strip with AIDS, to with aid to break the blockade. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  It was both symbolic, but like they also did have actual supplies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  The Israelis encircled their ship with drones, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=104.56s)]
*  attack drones, sprayed the boat with paint. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=110.56s)]
*  And then boarded this UK marked vessel in international waters [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=114.16s)]
*  and kidnapped everybody on board. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=118.66s)]
*  There are still many activists who remain in Israel, in part because [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=121.1s)]
*  they have it's unclear at this point because we don't know. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  But there's likely a question about whether or not they want to sign deportation papers [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=132.94s)]
*  because that would. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=138.18s)]
*  At least in Israel's legal framework, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=140.4s)]
*  it would acknowledge falsely that they like came into Israel when they did it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=144.38s)]
*  So a lot of the activists are reticent to sign deportation papers [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=148.8s)]
*  because it would be some legal acknowledgement that they did something wrong [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=152.08s)]
*  when they didn't. They were in international waters. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=155.34s)]
*  Crazy to be kidnapped in international waters and have to then obey [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=157.24s)]
*  that lunatic country's laws. But go on. Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=161.28s)]
*  And so we do know two of the volunteers, the Brazilian volunteer, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=163.82s)]
*  Thiago Avila and the French Palestinian European Parliament member, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=168.8s)]
*  Rima Hassan. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  They've been transferred to separate prison facilities, according to France 24, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  away from the others in place in solitary confinement, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  according to this Israeli human rights group. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=182.96s)]
*  I also saw that Thiago, I don't know if it's true, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=186.52s)]
*  I was seeing on Twitter that he might've started a hunger strike in protest. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  And they sent Greta back on a plane, which, you know, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=194.84s)]
*  I don't know, I don't put it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  It's the most efficient way to transport her out of the country. Sure. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=200.28s)]
*  But they also know that she doesn't fly as a matter of principle. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=204.16s)]
*  And they wanted that photo op of her in an airplane. Yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=208.68s)]
*  It's one thing put her on a plane. Okay. Whatever. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=211.6s)]
*  To take pictures of it and have all your fucking government ministers gloating [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=214.4s)]
*  about it is freakish behavior. But standard of Israel. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=219.06s)]
*  So standard, it's almost mundane compared to the other Hasbra. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  And, but here she is immediately after getting off the plane, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=228.0s)]
*  answering questions from reporters about her experience. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=233.04s)]
*  And this is where she's asked about if she's disappointed that they couldn't [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=236.28s)]
*  break the blockade. A basic basis. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=240.52s)]
*  Are you disappointed you didn't manage to break the blockade? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=244.16s)]
*  I'm, I don't know if disappointed is the right word. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=250.0s)]
*  This is a continued violation of the international law and war crimes that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=253.44s)]
*  Israel are systematically committing against Palestinians by not letting aid [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=258.6s)]
*  come in by starving people and mass slaughtering in every possible way. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=263.52s)]
*  During a, during a live stream, full blown genocide that the world is watching. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=271.4s)]
*  European government position. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=278.0s)]
*  They're doing a lot. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=280.76s)]
*  Yeah. Both in, in, in, in our case, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=282.0s)]
*  their silence was complicity with, with Israel's illegal actions. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=286.36s)]
*  But most importantly, their complicity in the genocide that's going on now by [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=290.52s)]
*  sending aid, by sending military and financial support to Israel. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  They are also part of the killings of Palestinians. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=299.36s)]
*  There's a conference coming up at the UN. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=302.88s)]
*  France is thinking of recognizing the state of Palestine. How do you think, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=304.68s)]
*  how do you feel about that? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=308.72s)]
*  It's the very, very bare minimum. Of course, welcome, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=309.96s)]
*  but we need so much more than that. When, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=314.84s)]
*  when there's even a risk of genocide happening, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=317.92s)]
*  we have a duty to prevent that from happening. And right now we have, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=321.68s)]
*  we are so far gone beyond that stage. It is, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=325.44s)]
*  there are no words to describe the betrayal that is happening every day by, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=330.32s)]
*  by our own governments. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=335.68s)]
*  Well said. And do you just see how unmeshed she is? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=339.72s)]
*  And there are previous questions about like, was your experience difficult? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=342.44s)]
*  How did the Israelis treat you? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=346.12s)]
*  She didn't even really answer those because she would redirect it to the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=347.76s)]
*  suffering of the people in Gaza. This was another answer I liked of hers. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=352.44s)]
*  She's asked later in the press conference why she agreed to leave Israel. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=357.44s)]
*  And the answer should be a little bit self-evident, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=362.08s)]
*  but then is asked why she thinks the world is ignoring or, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=364.52s)]
*  or the not the world, honestly, it's the, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=369.24s)]
*  the people in power are allowing this genocide to happen in the West. And, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=372.24s)]
*  her answer was good on that too. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=377.12s)]
*  Why would I want to stay in Israeli prison? Like more than necessary. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  Why do you think so many countries, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=390.72s)]
*  governments around the world are just ignoring what is happening in Gaza? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=393.24s)]
*  Because of racism. That's the simple answer I would say. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=398.64s)]
*  Racism and basically desperately trying to defend a destructive, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  deadly system that systematically puts short-term economic profit and to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=407.8s)]
*  maximize geopolitical power over the wellbeing of humans and the planet. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=412.4s)]
*  And right now it's very, very difficult to morally defend that. It's, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=418.91999999999996s)]
*  it is impossible, but still they are desperately trying, which is. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=423.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, it is not the word, but there are no words to describe it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=428.64s)]
*  Objectively heroic action by everybody on board, including Greta, obviously. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=434.68s)]
*  In 2025, if you told me like in 2012, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=439.44s)]
*  that what we would be doing is spending billions and billions of dollars to [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=442.91999999999996s)]
*  genocide Palestinians and secure political systems across the West, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=446.88s)]
*  um, UK, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=452.88s)]
*  Americas by buying politicians from the Israel lobby to make sure that nothing [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=454.96s)]
*  can be done about it. Instead of addressing climate change, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  instead of doing anything about like, I don't know, high speed travel or rail, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=462.84s)]
*  or, you know, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=467.88s)]
*  instead of any of the huge civilizational problems facing the fucking world, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=469.64s)]
*  we're doing this shit. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=475.76s)]
*  And she says it there. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=478.08s)]
*  It's to maintain the system of profitability and short-term profits over [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=479.32s)]
*  humanity and over, uh, just. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=484.32s)]
*  Western supremacy. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Western supremacy and the plant. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  Do you know how many tons of munitions Israel has dropped on that 141 square [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=491.48s)]
*  mile strip of land on top of what used to be 2.3 [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=496.44s)]
*  million people in that area? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=502.12s)]
*  Like the amount of destruction in our environment is, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=504.36s)]
*  it's just obvious that she would stand alongside the Palestinian people because [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=508.8s)]
*  colonialism and capitalism are interconnected. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=515.08s)]
*  Hate to break it to people, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=519.0s)]
*  but the reason the planet is burning is because of the seeking of endless [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=520.76s)]
*  profits and colonialism was a way to make capitalism global. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwShCo3Pqc8&t=524.4399999999999s)]
