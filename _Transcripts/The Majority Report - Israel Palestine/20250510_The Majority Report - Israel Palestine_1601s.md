# "How Do You Sleep At Night?": Woman Brilliantly Confronts John Fetterman  On His Genocide Support
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0)
*  Big story this morning about our favorite. I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=0.0s)]
*  Don't know [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=5.2s)]
*  My top pick for the live-action Shrek [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  John Fetterman. Yes, my favorite professional wrestler turned [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=10.96s)]
*  Senator I don't know what he did before he was a senator. I just assumed he was a professional wrestler [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=16.76s)]
*  And then I was told no, he's just some Harvard guy. Yeah, just a Harvard guy who we [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=23.12s)]
*  lessons learned perhaps if we have candidates who have a history of like [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=30.44s)]
*  Chasing down somebody with a gun and perhaps it's racially motivated that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=36.0s)]
*  Sometimes those aren't one-offs. Yeah [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=41.28s)]
*  Situations can't be explained. Yeah egg on my face. I [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=44.64s)]
*  Looked at him and I was just like yeah, that's what we need [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  We need you know, just a six foot eight white guy who just had a stroke to finally [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=53.28s)]
*  You know get that get that MAGA crowd to start, you know seeing some some sense, you know [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=59.58s)]
*  And then and then he just started doing MAGA talking points. I was like, oh that actually makes more sense [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=64.86s)]
*  That makes more sense that he is just that guy and what's fun about Fetterman is is that all of this usual suspects? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=71.5s)]
*  Had decided preemptively well, maybe not preemptively but once he started going down the I'm [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=79.02s)]
*  The Zionism is the most important thing ever to me down that road [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=85.18s)]
*  There was a class of Democrats that said this is the kind of populace that need Democrats [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=89.14s)]
*  Populist the one who's who's gonna take really unpopular positions in both his party and you know [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=97.02s)]
*  I think more so it's happening more and more in the Republican Party [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=103.86s)]
*  Well, Iglesias is a popularist, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=107.69999999999999s)]
*  so he's always says you got to just respond to the polling as a Democrat, but they ignore things like [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=110.02s)]
*  Israel where a majority of Democrats it's not close now have negative feelings about it and also [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=115.86s)]
*  Like ignores the effect that you can have agency over public opinion as a politician by using the bully poll [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=121.86s)]
*  But that's kind of important. That's like the whole point is that's why it's to be a leader is is when you lead, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=127.69999999999999s)]
*  Right, and then isn't that the whole thing? They don't like doing politics [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=135.54s)]
*  They're resentful of it [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=139.34s)]
*  These people said this like two years after they had declared Eric Adams is the future of the tough-on-crime Democrat [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=140.54s)]
*  Can we maybe cut like they they care about what's popular with donors? That's right, right [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=147.14s)]
*  Right, you know, right. I mean sure but also, you know, what's what's popular with donors and other people? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=154.18s)]
*  Who are sucking on the teat of those donors and I think you forget that that's a class of people [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=163.18s)]
*  Yeah, stop ignoring that don't erase them [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=170.26s)]
*  Erase them there. Those are workers [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=172.66s)]
*  Those are part of the revolution is the people who are going to be actively serving the the you know, the moneyed class [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=174.9s)]
*  Would you hide them? Would you hide them? Would you hide all of the personal assistance of the oligarchy? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=183.02s)]
*  I would and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=191.26s)]
*  So that's how you know, we're we're we're on the red side of history here [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=193.82s)]
*  So Federman was sitting. All right, like this this article is kind of sad [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=199.3s)]
*  He's lost his mind after having a stroke but [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=206.06s)]
*  this is a some [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=209.66s)]
*  someone who was [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  Saw him the summer mob at as you m e r mo be on Twitter or on Instagram [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=213.34s)]
*  Good job summer mob spotted Federman in public the other day and this is how that went down [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=219.34s)]
*  Senator you still feel that Israel has the right to kill and kill and kill people [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=225.94s)]
*  You still think Israel has rights to defend itself still [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=232.42s)]
*  When is enough enough senator? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=237.1s)]
*  I don't know why you're harassing me. That's not harassment. You're a senator, right? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=240.34s)]
*  I saw you coming and I assumed you were gonna come over. I mean you work for the people right you're supposed to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=244.06s)]
*  You're in these halls for the people [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=251.54s)]
*  Right and my people are being slaughtered because of your votes and the money that you sent to Israel and your [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=254.94s)]
*  complicity in genocide [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=262.98s)]
*  You have nothing to say about that over a hundred thousand Palestinians have been slaughtered [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=267.5s)]
*  How do you sleep at night senator [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=274.46s)]
*  We're not adding those crickets seriously [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=276.9s)]
*  How do you sleep at night? Do you not see the videos and the and the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=278.9s)]
*  Just the children that are being slaughtered out there. I [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=283.97999999999996s)]
*  Don't have anything to say you don't anything to say. Of course not [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=287.58s)]
*  I'm just sitting on a bench because a pack that pays you way too much money to say anything to be a human being [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=297.5s)]
*  What a shame what a shame you do not deserve the position that you have at all [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=298.62s)]
*  Shame on you for being complicit in genocide shame on you [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=304.38s)]
*  Agree, how you do it 100% this should be the standard for anyone [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=308.78s)]
*  Who is in a position of power? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=315.9s)]
*  Being in public the standard should be you go up to them and tell them what they you know [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=318.7s)]
*  What they're supporting and then ask for an explanation that the idea that he's like, I'm just listen [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=325.7s)]
*  I just came out here in an open field to sit on bench [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=332.46000000000004s)]
*  Like I do love bench love to sit and think think my thoughts. What are they about? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=336.86s)]
*  And I think blood and soil doesn't matter what my thoughts are [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm thinking them and I would like to be alone with my thoughts [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=345.26s)]
*  Yeah, the idea that is like and now you're harassing me in this position where I'm literally sitting here in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=348.78000000000003s)]
*  Public being like, oh, you know, I'm just it looks like he's waiting for a meeting [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=356.38s)]
*  You know, he looks like he's gonna feed some birds and tell them to you know, start funding the IDF [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=360.74s)]
*  Right [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=366.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he it well it also looks like I don't know the this is it's almost like the Forrest Gump [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=367.3s)]
*  Scene of him sitting on the bench, but instead but instead Fetterman's imagining the woman asking him questions about the box of chocolate [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=374.82s)]
*  About the box of chocolate [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=381.98s)]
*  Sitting there waiting for a bus this bus is gonna take me to Jerusalem [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=387.7s)]
*  We need to destroy the al-aqsa mosque and build the third temple just on a loop [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=394.82s)]
*  Yeah, really remedial for folks for a second. That's a senator of our nation here [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=400.38s)]
*  The Senate is one of our bodies of Congress it's supposed to be the greatest deliberative body on earth [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=406.46s)]
*  Does anyone watching this think that they can't deliberate better than that guy sitting on that? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=412.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=419.82s)]
*  So the problem is is that I want to this article that just came out this morning in New York magazine is [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=421.9s)]
*  expansive about [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=430.21999999999997s)]
*  John Fetterman so great reporting by Ben Terrace of New York magazine [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=432.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I want to be sympathetic because as I'll read in some of these experts its excerpts [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=436.90000000000003s)]
*  It's abundantly clear that he is he has lost his mind [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=442.06s)]
*  Yeah [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=445.66s)]
*  But the problem is is that then perhaps he needs to be removed from the Senate because he is voting for genocide [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=446.78000000000003s)]
*  But there's a lot of money [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=453.22s)]
*  Moneyed interests like a pack that are okay with somebody who's functionally basically brain dead [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=455.02000000000004s)]
*  Right as long as they vote to send weapons [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=460.29999999999995s)]
*  Yes, this is what they they would much rather have someone who's just going to you know [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=463.21999999999997s)]
*  Like the all they have left of their brain is the lizard part. That's just like eat chicken sleep [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=469.21999999999997s)]
*  You know go peepee go poo poo vote for weapons for Israel like that's all they really want [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=474.97999999999996s)]
*  They don't want anyone who's actually gonna have any like critical thinking skills or someone who is gonna bend to the will of their constituents [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=480.53999999999996s)]
*  Because you know they want [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=487.78s)]
*  You know, yeah, they want people to vote for Israel. That's it and I saw Zach Zachary Carter say this like that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=490.53999999999996s)]
*  Now there's this man with serious mental health struggles [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=498.94s)]
*  And it's now indistinguishable from the bipartisan foreign policy of the United States and that kind of tracks [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=502.46s)]
*  But this is how this opens this piece. It's called all by himself [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=508.21999999999997s)]
*  Over in New York magazine when John Fetterman was released from Walter Reed Hospital in March 2023 [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=512.46s)]
*  Adam Gentleson then his chief of staff was proud of his boss for seeking help for what the senator's office and his doctor [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=518.22s)]
*  Had said was a case of clinical depression [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=523.74s)]
*  His six weeks of inpatient care had been the latest medical setback for the Pennsylvania Democrat who had a stroke [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=525.86s)]
*  mere [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=533.26s)]
*  Months before being elected to the US Senate in 2022 nearly derailing his campaign against Republican met met Oz [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=534.5s)]
*  But a year after his release from the hospital Fetterman's behavior had so alarmed Gentleson that he had resigned his position [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=542.1s)]
*  I should say that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=547.98s)]
*  Gentleson was kind of defensive of Fetterman for a while and I remember being critical of Gentleson in particular and I'll say he's still [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=549.3000000000001s)]
*  Bashing the left in a way that I don't think this [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=556.22s)]
*  This really I think this is protecting his legacy a little bit [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=559.14s)]

*  I wouldn't have him back on this program. He need to do a lot more than this in my opinion [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=567.02s)]
*  He went on the record and of course, there's some career self-preservation here [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=570.32s)]
*  I'm sure cynically grateful for this information at the very least but agreed. Yeah [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=574.84s)]
*  But after his release from the hospital Fetterman's behavior had so alarmed Gentleson that he resigned his position in May 2024 [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=582.12s)]
*  He wrote an urgent letter to David Williamson the medical director of the traumatic brain injury and [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=587.7600000000001s)]

*  I think John is on a bad trajectory and I'm really worried about him the email began if things didn't change Gentleson continued [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=598.22s)]
*  He was concerned Fetterman quote won't be with us for much longer [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=604.82s)]
*  His 1600 word email came with the subject line concerns and it contained a list of them from the seemingly mundane [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=608.74s)]
*  He eats fast food multiple times a day. Okay easy. Yeah [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=615.5400000000001s)]
*  That's the mundane part I like that too because it's just like well he just had a stroke [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=620.4200000000001s)]
*  Right well I mean [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=625.5s)]

*  Munch fries please [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=629.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's like the they're like no that's not even the worst of it him actively trying to kill himself with McDonald's is not the worst of it [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=630.5s)]
*  Yeah, right, right. That's that's benign here [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=637.1s)]
*  To the scary we don't know if he is taking his meds and his behavior frequently suggests [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=640.14s)]
*  He is not we often see this kind the kind of warning signs we discussed Gentleson wrote conspiratorial thinking [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=644.86s)]
*  For example he claims to be the most knowledgeable source on Israel and Gaza around but his sources are just what he reads in the news [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=651.1800000000001s)]
*  He declines most briefings and never reads memos [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=657.86s)]
*  High highs and low lows long rambling repetitive and self-centered monologues lying ways [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=661.5s)]
*  They're painfully awkwardly obvious to everyone in the room [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=666.5s)]
*  Fetterman was according to Gentleson avoiding the regular checkups advised by his doctors [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=669.74s)]
*  He was preoccupied with the social media platform X [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=673.88s)]
*  Which he previously admitted had been a major accelerant of his depression [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=676.76s)]
*  He drove his car so recklessly Gentleson said that the staff that staff refused to ride with him [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=680.5s)]
*  He had also brought bought a gun [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=686.92s)]

*  Right. It's like I didn't know DC was so let's just say diverse, right? Just a diverse [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=698.3599999999999s)]
*  Gotta protect myself here another red flag [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=704.7600000000001s)]
*  Gentleson added every person who was supposed to help him stay on his recovery plan has been pushed out [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  He damaged personal relationships blah blah blah. There's also stuff about [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=712.6s)]
*  Delusions just keep going. There's this I [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  highlighted all of these different parts [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=720.88s)]

*  You know, there's stuff where he thinks he's being followed, right? Yeah [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=726.2s)]
*  Okay, let's go do you say is gang stalking yes [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=730.0s)]
*  Go to if you could search members of his team and the paragraph that starts from that's a little further down [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=733.5600000000001s)]
*  Members of his team told me this was an early warning sign that something was off with their boss in early February [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=739.24s)]
*  2023 after Fetterman had indeed been sworn in members of the Senate gathered at the Library of Congress for a caucus retreat [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=744.44s)]
*  Fetterman fresh off a hard-fought victory in the cycles marquee race [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=750.6800000000001s)]
*  Should have been riding high only he wasn't a staffer recalled getting a text from a person at the retreat saying if there was [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=754.32s)]
*  Boss was okay [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=759.88s)]
*  Fetterman was sitting at a table by himself slowly sipping a coke and refusing to talk with anybody [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=761.2s)]
*  later that day another staffer [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=767.36s)]
*  Heard an alarming port from a journalist Fetterman had just walked obliviously into the road and was nearly struck by a car [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=771.12s)]
*  Amazing this is like I don't know if you guys have ever you know, I like owned a very very old dog [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=780.76s)]
*  But yes like at some point you're just like what is it doing and they're like, oh it's going somewhere to die [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=787.4s)]
*  It's like why is it spending so much time in that corner? Yeah, it's very it's very sad [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=796.2s)]
*  This is like when Nixon is after the Kent State [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  Shootings he was like wandering around the Lincoln Memorial [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=809.32s)]
*  I think this isn't like the Oliver Stone movie like walking around with the Lincoln Memorial and got into like fights with like [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=812.68s)]
*  Anti-war activists like trying to make them think he was a good person [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=818.4399999999999s)]
*  This is like Fetterman's been doing that that was just one night for [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=822.16s)]
*  Yeah, Nixon's entire time in the Senate Nixon just had some stiff drinks like that's Trump level delusion [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=825.84s)]
*  We're at a different level with Fetterman. It's so funny because it's it's like this was you know, like all of the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=831.5s)]
*  Incidents that they're citing happens like not long after he had won the election like as soon as he became a senator [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=838.98s)]
*  His attitude was like, oh leave me alone. I know it's like you just ran for this [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=847.14s)]
*  Why are you mad at everyone? Why do you have the disposition of like a teenager in a Disney original? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=854.9s)]
*  A [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=861.38s)]
*  Week later, this is okay. This is crazy [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=862.98s)]
*  I'm sorry [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=866.02s)]
*  Sherrod Brown maybe helped give background on this because he's named specifically a week later Democratic [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=866.62s)]
*  Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown came to pay Fetterman a visit in his new Capitol office [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=873.62s)]
*  They seemed destined to get along each hailed from a purplish [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=877.14s)]
*  Purplish red states and exuded an everyman energy more likely to be found in Union Halls than in the halls of Congress [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=880.46s)]
*  But their meeting went awry Brown tried his best to get a conversation going [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=886.18s)]
*  But according to two people present Fetterman was virtually quote catatonic [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=890.7s)]
*  He could barely string two sentences together talking so quietly that everyone in the room had to strain to hear him [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=894.98s)]
*  Fetterman then stood up and began walking around the office in tight loops a move [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=901.6600000000001s)]
*  This two staffers described as doing figure eights after Brown left [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=906.1400000000001s)]
*  Fetterman pace from one room inside his office complex to another and back again at one point one of his aides said he walked into [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=912.4200000000001s)]
*  The hallway peering over his shoulder as if he were being followed by shadowy figures [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=919.58s)]
*  Hamas [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=925.14s)]
*  Pacing that is not a good sign [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=926.9000000000001s)]
*  No, that's pretty bad, especially like the looking over your shoulder and pacing and just being like no way out no way out [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=929.7800000000001s)]
*  That is I mean, it's clear obviously is this was like, you know before his [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=936.4200000000001s)]
*  Hospitalization for whatever mental health crisis was going on right? Yeah, and and then [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=942.86s)]
*  we all [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=950.0600000000001s)]
*  celebrated him putting you know his mental health like [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=952.1s)]
*  Forward, you know like making that an issue because we all said yes, we need to start talking about mental health [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=956.14s)]
*  And then he's not a good role model for no [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=962.5400000000001s)]
*  It's this thing where we we're all like well, you know [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=967.38s)]
*  Obviously, we're not trying to paint every person with mental health with the same brush and also it's important to talk about these things [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=970.46s)]
*  There are people who are depressed and [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=976.22s)]
*  assholes [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=978.86s)]
*  That's a thing. You know what I mean? You can be clinically depressed and a dick and a dick too [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=980.14s)]
*  And if you're gonna say like this is this is how we do it [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=986.02s)]
*  You better be a good model for it or maybe don't put yourself on that pedestal. I would just say here's another section [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=988.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you had this Emma, but [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=993.1s)]
*  behind the scenes things are worse in March Federman suddenly took an early morning trip to heart to Hartford, Connecticut without telling his team [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=994.9s)]

*  I took a weekend trip to in March to visit the gravesite of my friend from grad school who died in 1993 [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1014.46s)]

*  Israel declared war and retaliated with brute force killing Hamas forces as well as thousands of civilians in the US progressives began calling for a [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1045.18s)]

*  To at least pause the carnage [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1053.58s)]
*  Federman felt differently now is not the time to talk about a ceasefire. He posted in October 18th [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1055.58s)]
*  We must support Israel and efforts to eliminate Hamas terrorists who slaughtered innocent men women and children [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1061.26s)]

*  Anonymously saying they found his full-throated support for Israel to be a quote gutting the trail [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1074.18s)]
*  Gentleson had been had taken to defending Federman on X from such criticisms [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1080.26s)]
*  I had mentioned that earlier, but it wasn't just staffers who were upset [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1084.18s)]
*  There was also Federman's wife Giselle who had been come something of a political celebrity in her own, right? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1087.94s)]
*  She is a kind-hearted philanthropist the proprietor of a free store in Braddock that gave away goods and clothing a [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1094.74s)]

*  They are bombing refugee camps. How can you support this? The staffer recalled her saying with tears in her eyes [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1112.7s)]
*  That's all propaganda Federman replied [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1118.14s)]
*  God [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1121.54s)]
*  Later a still visibly upset Giselle pulled the staffer aside [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1122.78s)]
*  She asked him if members of Federman's team were pushing him to take these stances for political reasons [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1126.58s)]
*  The staffer told her that the opposite was true [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1131.9s)]
*  Many of them were as upset as she was if you're pushing back on this [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1136.34s)]
*  There's no hope the staffer recalled her saying this is horrible news [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1141.26s)]

*  Posing with Netanyahu. I mean that's not great. But I mean they said he got a gun and there's like [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1383.8600000000001s)]

*  facing away from him so [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1397.42s)]
*  as a [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1399.98s)]
*  Certified body language expert I would say that she is not into that particular situation. Oh, you're trained in body [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1401.14s)]
*  Expertise this is for your audition for Fox News. That's right. Yeah [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1409.22s)]
*  This is how I punch [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1413.66s)]
*  There's just one final section to underline kind of like the genocidal mania this guy is he's meeting with Jeremy Ben and me of like [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1419.18s)]
*  Sort of liberal Zionist organization J Street, which is pro is pro is from pro peace, you know [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1425.78s)]
*  And Federman lectures the guy saying you can't reform sour milk [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1433.0600000000002s)]
*  He told Ben and me according to the notes from meeting referring to Palestinians as sour milk [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1436.94s)]
*  Fettersman said he did not believe in a two-state solution claim that he had never met an Arab person who would condemn Hamas [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1442.6200000000001s)]
*  correction the notes from the meeting stated only a single Arab he has met with that staff was present for wouldn't outright condemn Hamas [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1448.18s)]
*  Fettersman went on to make statements that shocked people in opposing a ceasefire [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1456.1000000000001s)]
*  He said let's get back to killing a person who heard the station told me [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1459.1000000000001s)]
*  He said kill them all in a statement Fettersman denied the account adding any reference to killing was solely about Hamas [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1464.14s)]
*  I do support the destruction of that organization down to its last member. I don't believe him [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1472.54s)]
*  I mean he can claim I mean that's the this is the old, you know [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1478.66s)]
*  switcheroo trick would they do with the Hamas thing where it's just like no all of my genocidal language if I just [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1483.58s)]
*  Direct it at Hamas [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1490.9s)]
*  Then I don't have to think about the fact that you know [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1492.94s)]
*  I consider literally every man woman and child in Gaza to be Hamas [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1496.54s)]
*  You know either Hamas [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1500.6999999999998s)]
*  Then that that's the top tier that Hamas pre Hamas or Hamas [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1503.02s)]
*  Enablers like the right in that are married to Hamas. They're not overthrowing Hamas. So, you know, right exactly [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1508.1s)]
*  Yeah, they're Hamas voters or they're the progeny of Hamas voters [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYTQgH2d2u0&t=1513.86s)]
