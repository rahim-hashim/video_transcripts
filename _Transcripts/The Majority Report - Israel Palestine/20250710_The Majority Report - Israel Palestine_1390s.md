# What Happened To “Vote Blue No Matter Who” ???
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo)
*  Ari Melber had Hakeem Jeffries on and asked him about Zoran Mamdani and asked him if it's a good [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=0.0s)]
*  thing for the party because we now have the official numbers. Zoran got the most votes in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=6.24s)]
*  the history of New York City mayoral primaries. And he did that by turning out parts of the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=11.52s)]
*  electorate that were disaffected, that didn't engage in politics maybe as a high propensity [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=17.36s)]
*  voter. These are the kinds of voters that Democrats have lost over the years. Alienated actively. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=25.6s)]
*  And right, with the suburban Republican strategy. And so there's a lot of consultants and wealthy [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=31.28s)]
*  Democrats and Democratic leadership that that's their constituency. Like Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=37.68s)]
*  Schumer need to hang their hat, and particularly Schumer because he's the one that was a big part [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  of spearheading this. Their constituency is now like what they have cultivated, which are upper [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=50.0s)]
*  middle class suburban Republicans versus what Mamdani did, which is creating a working class [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=57.76s)]
*  coalition, despite what you'll hear printed as fact in papers. Mamdani won voters really starting [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=64.88s)]
*  at around 55k to 150k. And once the wealthier donors started to vote, that's the voters that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=72.32s)]
*  Cuomo won. But it's still being framed as it's like, oh, the well-educated white liberals carried him [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  over the finish line. And there's in part truth that Brooklyn showed out a lot, parts of Manhattan [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=92.24s)]
*  showed out a lot, but that's not the story. It's just not what happened. This is the kind of thing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=99.44s)]
*  that should be replicated across the country. And what's fascinating is I think that you see [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=104.88s)]
*  some Democratic aligned pundits or whatever, they're starting to see that this is an issue, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=110.96s)]
*  that the leadership of the party is more focused seemingly on tamping down this energy that the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=117.36s)]
*  party so desperately needs, then they are combating Republicans effectively. And here is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=122.48s)]
*  Melber asking kind of point blank of Hakeem Jeffries why they're not more enthusiastic. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=130.24s)]
*  This is the thing. They're getting young people involved. You're supposed to care about that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=136.88s)]
*  This was apparently the problem, but not like this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=140.4s)]
*  One-mom Donnie came out of nowhere with less money, less fame, beat the Democratic establishment, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  beat Mario Cuomo, I should say Andrew Cuomo, son of Mario Cuomo, known in New York. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=151.04s)]
*  Is that a good thing for the Democratic party? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=156.88s)]
*  Well, he ran a tremendous race. He outworked the opposition. He outcommunicated the opposition. He [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=160.48s)]
*  outorganized the opposition. And I think one of the things that was key about what he was able to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  do is that he ran directly at the issue of affordability across every age demographic. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=171.28s)]
*  It's the number one issue in the city of New York. Now he articulated a very provocative [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=178.48s)]
*  platform in that regard. I look forward to sitting down and talking to him about his [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=185.68s)]
*  plans to actually implement that platform to deal with some of the challenges that the communities [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=189.2s)]
*  that I face are dealing with in terms of gentrification. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=194.16s)]
*  Oh, gentrification, he says. He gave a quote, his staffer gave a quote, and we read this yesterday, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=198.0s)]
*  it got me pretty heated on CNN, where they called his coalition team gentrification because Jeffries, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=204.0s)]
*  his district, it went to Mom Donnie. Instead of embracing the presumptive nominee of the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=212.96s)]
*  Democratic party who won his district, he's saying this to MSNBC, a more liberal audience, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=218.32s)]
*  and then having his top political staffer say to CNN disparaging remarks about the movement on the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=224.8s)]
*  other end. And then the quote that is so notable in this article is that they basically threaten [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  the DSA members with primary challenges in the body of the piece. Leader Hakeem Jeffries is [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  focused on taking back the House from the MAGA extremists. By the way, no Republicans there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=246.8s)]
*  This is Sam's, the bee in his bonnet that they calling them this like focus tested thing from [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=251.2s)]
*  a consultant as opposed to saying it's the Republicans. The MAGA extremists who ripped [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=256.96s)]
*  health care away from millions of Americans, Jeffries Senior Advisor Andre Richardson told CNN. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=260.88s)]
*  However, if team gentrification wants a primary fight, our response will be forceful and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=266.08s)]
*  unrelenting. We will teach them and all their incumbents a painful lesson on June 23rd, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=271.2s)]
*  2026. You mean like the painful lesson that Zoran just taught the Democratic establishment [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=278.64s)]
*  by winning by 12 points? Yeah, I don't know if Afaira Soufrain-Forest is part of team gentrification [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=284.0s)]
*  according to Jeffries or not, but she tweeted this out. Weird threat to make since Hakeem [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=290.08s)]
*  already went after Jabari, Bristport and I. How'd that go for him again? 2022 primary results. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=295.76s)]
*  Bristport 70%, Afaira got 67%. If Leader wants another public beatdown, he knows where to find [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=300.08s)]
*  him. These are empty idle threats from these folks. Bring it on. Yeah. Cannot shy away from [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=306.08s)]
*  this sort of thing. Absolutely not. Bristport would be a formidable primary challenge to Hakeem. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=312.96s)]
*  He's great. Right. Also, I just love the idea that like they go after them for like they go after for, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=318.64s)]
*  I guess, like Mamdani or Bristport or any of these, you know, left wing, you know, politicians or [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  people who run for office and they the thing they automatically go out them for is, oh, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=333.44s)]
*  their voter base is gentrifiers. Gentrification is the issue here. The funny thing is like Mamdani, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=339.12s)]
*  one of his policies would help very much so. You know, they talk about, Jeffries talk about [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=345.84s)]
*  the affordability thing that he ran on and Mamdani ran on and won. The freezing the rent for rent [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=351.92s)]
*  stabilized apartments. Those aren't gentrifiers living in those of those apartments. Those are [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=357.76s)]
*  long living, you know, lifelong New Yorkers or people who've lived in New York for a very long [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=363.35999999999996s)]
*  time who have rent stabilized apartments for the most part. Yet these guys always bring up that as, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  oh, that's not going to help. That's not going to help. We don't want him to do that. It's amazing [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  that like the thing that would actually help the non-gentrifiers, these New York natives, such as [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  myself, for example, they go after those policies that help those people, but they knock the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=383.44s)]
*  gentrifiers claiming that they're the ones who will really be the one to help the native lifelong [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=389.84s)]
*  New Yorkers. It's amazing. No, it's worse than it's even worse than that. And you're making great [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=395.44s)]
*  points. It's just they're stoking divisions within the electorate by calling other people gentrifiers [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  as if this is like an active choice by people who are getting price out of Manhattan to displace [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  black and brown communities. This is a systemic problem that Mamdani is addressing. And they're [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=414.96s)]
*  like when for all of his talk about affordability, he's trying to pit New Yorkers against one another [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=421.68s)]
*  to cement his hold on power. And I think that's really gross, to be honest. It is. And it's all [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  in service of serving the same political donors that are ultimately underpinning both parties [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=433.84s)]
*  right now, because I think what we're seeing in the very targeted, very venomous antagonism from, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  you know, the left, right and left, but like the center left, liberal aligned media apparatus, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=444.4s)]
*  as long as well as the New York Post and more conservative media is that for both parties, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=450.4s)]
*  but I think especially Democratic Party Mamdani represents a threat not to the Democratic Party [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=455.12s)]
*  itself as an institution, but to the current establishment, the current, you know, people who [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=460.24s)]
*  are in charge and want to be taking money from billionaires. And I think we can see from their [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=464.56s)]
*  behavior so far, their plan for the midterms and their plans for the next general election, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=470.16s)]
*  it's just let Trump basically have his way with the American people, with the American economy, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=474.24s)]
*  you know, make life as bad as possible while they make as few promises, a few concrete promises as [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  possible, because they, you know, they want to be able to coast in on anti-Republican ideology. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=484.88000000000005s)]
*  They want to be able to coast in just based on not being Trump. And they never want to be [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=490.0s)]
*  responsible for actively trying to uplift people's lives in a comprehensive way. And that's what [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=493.44000000000005s)]
*  Mamdani is doing. And he's, you know, teaching people that they might demand more from the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=498.4s)]
*  Democratic Party. Exactly. All right. Let's yeah. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=502.08s)]
*  ...and displacement. Go back like 10 seconds. Yeah. Sorry. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=507.12s)]
*  ... platform in that regard. I look forward to sitting down and talking to him about his plans [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=511.28s)]
*  to actually implement that platform to deal with some of the challenges that the communities that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=516.16s)]
*  I face are dealing with in terms of gentrification and displacement. And he just won those communities [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=520.9599999999999s)]
*  massively in the mayoral primary, big guy. But go ahead. A whole host of other issues that I would [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=527.04s)]
*  normally talk about with any Democratic nominee. And certainly we'll talk about with our particular [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  Democratic nominee in the context of the mayoral race. I think one of the things that we'll continue [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=538.48s)]
*  to try to do at the national level is to lean in aggressively to Donald Trump's failure to address [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=542.8s)]
*  the high cost of living. He promised to lower costs on day one, costs on going down, going up, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=549.36s)]
*  inflation is on the way up. Life remains far too expensive for the American people. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=554.08s)]
*  I gotta tell you. Democrats want to do something about it. Respectfully, I see the pivot. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=558.72s)]
*  You know, you're good at this. That's how you got this job. But then I gotta rephrase the question. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=562.48s)]
*  You're not ready yet to say whether it's a good thing. You want to meet with him. You want to [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=568.48s)]
*  kick the tires at this juncture. You're not ready to say that this turnout, this energy that he [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=571.6s)]
*  tapped in New York is good for the party yet. Oh, no, listen. I mean, I think that when you can [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=576.1600000000001s)]
*  increase the electorate, particularly as it relates to parts of the electorate that came out [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=582.32s)]
*  in significant numbers, which include the South Asian community in many parts of New York City, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=589.84s)]
*  and certainly younger folks under the age of 39 in New York City, that is absolutely a good thing. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=595.6s)]
*  And of course, he should be credited with pulling off that kind of campaign that reached so many [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  folks. But the tension here, if I'm hearing some possible tension is, as you know, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=611.36s)]
*  the Democratic Party has had a hard time with some of these, whatever you call them, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=616.88s)]
*  democratic socialists, insurgents, more liberal, energetic candidates, even when they do what you [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=622.32s)]
*  just referred to. So we have a history here from Bernie Sanders, some of the way the AOC or members [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=627.84s)]
*  of the squad were treated, and now some of the apparent reaction where people are wondering, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=633.44s)]
*  is there room in the tent? Not saying that even you have a lot more power than him, not saying you [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=637.92s)]
*  would endorse the whole platform. But when his platform is affordability, ideas around democratic [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=642.8s)]
*  socialism, raising the tax rate in the city of New York, free buses, a different type of foreign [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=647.28s)]
*  policy, if we simplify, but much more harshly critical of the Israeli government, say, than I [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=653.36s)]
*  think the congressional leaders have been in terms of approaching the entire conflict. Is there room [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=659.04s)]
*  in the Big Ten of the Democratic Party for that right now, or for you is that TBD? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=663.84s)]
*  Well, certainly we're a big tent party, and I think what I'll say in terms of the House [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=669.44s)]
*  Democratic Caucus family is that every single member of the House Democratic Caucus, from [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=673.12s)]
*  Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez all the way to Representative Jared Golden, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=680.08s)]
*  and everyone in between, progressives, New Dems, and Blue Dogs, we in the House, we represent the [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=685.6800000000001s)]
*  gorgeous mosaic of the American people. That's a good thing. I think what we have to do is make [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=692.08s)]
*  sure that we can more intimately communicate with the American people, that we understand their [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=697.36s)]
*  challenges and their... I can't. Ari Melber, he's an MSNBC host, and his politics seem good, but not [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  in Mehdi Hassan or even Joy Reid or something, like people that had been on the show before [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=715.76s)]
*  or on the network before. But that was like, you can tell he's uncomfortable with how [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=722.0s)]
*  they're scuttling this energy. It's a gift right in front of them, and they won't take it, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=730.48s)]
*  and it's because of corruption. And I don't know if this has ever been clearer to the public. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=737.2s)]
*  At the beginning of the interview, he goes, I want to know how he's going to implement this. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=745.6800000000001s)]
*  Dude, Bill de Blasio froze the rent multiple times. Mamdani can do that easily. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=750.4000000000001s)]
*  It's incompetent that you don't know already. Yeah. And in terms of funding, what he's trying [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=758.0s)]
*  to do, like the free bus thing, it's because he's been very clear, raising the corporate tax rate [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=764.6400000000001s)]
*  from around 7% to what it is across the river in New Jersey, which is 11 and change. That can be [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=769.2800000000001s)]
*  done if Hokel or whoever's if Delgado ends up winning that primary, whoever's governor, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=775.12s)]
*  that's what they're going to have to agree to. Although maybe actually it would be the next [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=782.8s)]
*  fiscal year. So it would still be Hokel, I should say. That's a question for Kathy Hokel, because [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=786.72s)]
*  all she has to do is basically say, OK, I'm going to work with the mayor and not try to undercut him [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=792.88s)]
*  and make sure that his promises are fulfilled. That's not a question for Zoran. That's a question [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=798.64s)]
*  for Kathy Hokel. But he would never ask that because this is just a way to smear him as [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=804.32s)]
*  unrealistic. And what happened to vote blue no matter who? Huh? The Democratic Party voters [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=808.6400000000001s)]
*  overwhelmingly by 12 points made Zoran their nominee. And you have the leaders of the party [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=815.0400000000001s)]
*  undercutting him. And it says everything. Let's take a look at the comments to this video. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  Just very briefly, the top comments. We need new leadership in the Democratic Party, says the first [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=826.08s)]
*  Hakeem quote, Trump is bad is not the answer. You got to do something else. Next person, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=830.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm sick of the Dem solution. Just wait till the next election. How did that work out? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=834.8000000000001s)]
*  Next person held out high hopes for Hakeem Jeffries. We find him woefully uninspiring [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=838.72s)]
*  as Schumer, who I don't find inspiring at all. And then just another one. Y'all are going to have [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=842.48s)]
*  to get rid of AIPAC if you want that big tent to work. Exactly. You cannot include AIPAC. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=849.2s)]
*  And that's a lot of Democrats. I mean, I mean, majority, I would think we have to primary all [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=854.96s)]
*  of them. Anybody who has taken Israel money is not going to be good on any of this stuff. It's [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=860.48s)]
*  clear as day. Yeah. I mean, I think it's just it also lays bare how, you know, flawed the thinking [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=864.88s)]
*  that Democratic Party politicians don't know what's popular is. They see what's popular. They know [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=871.12s)]
*  what's popular and they actively resist it. They actively are antagonistic to it. And when Mom Donnie [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=876.32s)]
*  wins, they're going to be fighting tooth and nail behind the scenes to make sure his, you know, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=881.6s)]
*  his agenda is as impede as possible while on the front end using him to fundraise around the country. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=885.04s)]
*  That's going to be like their exact strategy. Yeah, that's exactly right. And it's just it's [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=890.32s)]
*  yeah, what's what's fascinating is to see in Melbourne asking a question that I think is [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=897.7600000000001s)]
*  way more connected to the base than anything Hakeem Jeffries is saying. We played that clip of [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  her name is Jennifer Welch. Well, yeah, thanks, Brian. Yeah, right. Yesterday. And I've seen [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=908.4000000000001s)]
*  their podcast before. They do good work. But, you know, they're fairly mainstream. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=915.04s)]
*  Get people to vote for Democrats. I wouldn't I don't know if they would consider themselves [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=921.5999999999999s)]
*  socialist. Right. But then basically being extremely critical of leadership in a way that [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=925.28s)]
*  I'm hearing from people who are lifelong Democrats who did not like Bernie Sanders, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=932.3199999999999s)]
*  Hillary people, Biden people, whatever. I don't know. We need new leadership. These old people [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=937.52s)]
*  have to go. It may not be ideological for them, but they sense it, too. The Democrats for years [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=942.24s)]
*  now have been telling their base that Donald Trump and the Republican Party under Trump is an [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=948.88s)]
*  existential threat to democracy and everything that, you know, the liberal base loves about America. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=955.36s)]
*  And then Trump wins. And they're just like, well, I guess Trump ism is the new thing now. And they [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=961.76s)]
*  even capitulate to them on a number of issues, immigration being one of them, and then just expect [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=967.6s)]
*  their base to go along with it. They've created same thing we were talking about earlier with the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=973.36s)]
*  Republican Party creating a monster with their base wanting to go after all these supposed [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=980.16s)]
*  pedophiles and pedophile rings out there. The Democratic Party has created the monster with [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=987.52s)]
*  their base by telling them that Trump was a threat to democracy in this country, which is [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=992.32s)]
*  actually true. But their Democratic Party wants to now just go along with some parts of Trumpism [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=997.36s)]
*  and just give up. And the base is like, are you kidding me? So, you know, in that sense, they [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1002.5600000000001s)]
*  created a monster with their own base, too. But at least, you know, at least the Democratic base, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1007.36s)]
*  the monster they created there is based in a reality and are angry about something real and [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1011.44s)]
*  substantial. This graph here from Owen Winter. We showed this yesterday. I mean, but just look at [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1016.5600000000001s)]
*  first of all, Mamdani extremely close with lower income working people to an incumbent with the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1022.5600000000001s)]
*  massive name recognition of Cuomo and then middle income. And then that lead loses out to Cuomo. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1030.24s)]
*  I mean, this is very, this is their worst nightmare. It is that somebody can get both of those folks, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1038.0s)]
*  the professionals that are typically like, say, maybe, I mean, Lander, I mean, they helped out [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1043.52s)]
*  there, especially like that's the coalition that them leadership doesn't want to see is [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1048.16s)]
*  sort of professional liberals and more working class social Democrat type folks that they're [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1053.0400000000002s)]
*  terrified of it. These I want I mean, Brad Lander, he can do whatever he wants to do. He can be he's [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1059.6000000000001s)]
*  setting himself up to be Mamdani's number two if he wins. But if he chooses to take his politics [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1065.1200000000001s)]
*  national, I want he can he will I will canvas for this man across my district in New York 10. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1070.16s)]
*  If he primaries Dan Goldman and and we should be seeing this in a variety of different districts, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1078.5600000000002s)]
*  including Hadjikim, Jeffrey's district. It was Jabari, Bristport, right? That we were showing [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1085.52s)]
*  earlier in terms of that. Yeah, Ben Farah. Yeah, that's the crossover with his district. That would [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1092.0s)]
*  be great. He should primary him to and just one final point on land. I've said this before, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1096.8s)]
*  but I am I he's the model that he showed, I think is even more important than Zoran, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1101.6s)]
*  because I think like she'll say Jabari, them socialists have charismatic people. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1106.8s)]
*  Right, right. It's it's progressive, the sort of institutional progressivism that needs to be the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1111.76s)]
*  link to really empower that and not stabbed in the back, frankly. And Lander played his role [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1118.96s)]
*  perfectly. And then you see how formidable that is when that doesn't get divided based on, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1124.32s)]
*  you know, based on that side of the coalition deciding that we can't play ball with this farther [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1129.6s)]
*  left stuff. And that's the other thing that I think we need to also focus on from a national [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1135.28s)]
*  perspective is how do we get these matching fund systems in other parts of the country? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1140.6399999999999s)]
*  Because part of why Zoran was he's a he's a phenomenal candidate and a charismatic as [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1148.56s)]
*  hell and knows has great instincts and knows how to message and campaign and all of that. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1153.76s)]
*  But part of why he was able to get over the finish line is that when you have these matching funds [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1160.0800000000002s)]
*  and he met that goal and then got the millions that was able to get his word out, it creates this [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1164.5600000000002s)]
*  positive momentum that gets people on board who would have otherwise been disengaged because they [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1171.76s)]
*  thought this is not even possible for him to win. So much of what is terrifying to the Democratic [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1177.28s)]
*  establishment right now is that it's now been shown, whether it's AOC or other members of the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1183.44s)]
*  squad or Zoran know this kind of politics is possible. And once you win, it's an inevitable [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1188.8s)]
*  it creates this inevitability that people just it's an energy people want to be a part of. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1195.8400000000001s)]
*  And if there's more of these matching funds to combat the influx of corporate money in other [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1200.64s)]
*  cities, municipalities, districts and states around the country, this is how we try to claw [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1206.48s)]
*  back the explosion of dark money in our politics after Citizens United. And I hope that other folks [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1213.12s)]
*  and it's not in ranked choice, too. That's a big part of it. But for me, I think even more well, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1220.1599999999999s)]
*  no ranked choice is a big part of it because Lander Lander that was instrumental to his act [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1224.8s)]
*  of solidarity. So ranked choice, but I would say even more importantly, the matching fund thing [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1231.36s)]
*  across the country is the lesson people should organizers maybe should take away from this. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1236.7199999999998s)]
*  One final thing. This just reminds me of the way Zoran needs to enter the system is when Trump [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1244.0s)]
*  came out. So before the RNC in 2016, there was all this talk of there's going to be a coup and [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1250.0s)]
*  Ted Cruz is going to do something like that. And Trump's going to speak on the last day. But what's [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1255.36s)]
*  going to happen before then? So Trump comes out on the very first night and does this. And usually [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1258.32s)]
*  they hide the nominee until the final night. Exactly. But he puts it to bed. This is what [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1264.6399999999999s)]
*  Zoran and I think Zoran's doing this. But I just want to play this moment. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1268.4s)]
*  So you know what songs played and he comes out [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1277.44s)]
*  with this with a silhouette here and says, actually, daddy's home. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1281.1200000000001s)]
*  Here, wait, I'll play a little sound effect. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1286.88s)]
*  There he is. There he is. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1298.64s)]
*  All right. Yeah, Zoran needs to do that. Just sure. Just shot for shot remake of that, please. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1305.6000000000001s)]
*  But but they do have something in common in that they can make simplistic policy [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qre4x8gXKo&t=1311.52s)]
