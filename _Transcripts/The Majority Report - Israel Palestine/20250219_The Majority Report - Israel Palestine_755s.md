# Russell Brand's Astonishing Pro-Israel History
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII)
*  All right, well, let's do some clips, shall we? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, can we do Jerry's? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=3.2s)]
*  Wait, OK. Oh, we didn't get to this yesterday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=5.36s)]
*  Is this what you were referring? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=7.84s)]
*  Why don't you tee it up for me as I open up my sound sheet? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=9.24s)]
*  Well, so this is Newman. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=11.8s)]
*  It's Newman comes after him. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=14.84s)]
*  Is that what happened? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=17.1s)]
*  Newman is an anti-Zionist. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=18.2s)]
*  That's why they had such conflict in that apartment. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=23.0s)]
*  Is he pro-Palestine? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=25.6s)]
*  He's pro-Palestine. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=27.04s)]
*  Jerry, he's pro-Palestine. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=28.2s)]
*  I don't want him delivering my mail anymore. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=30.76s)]
*  So we weren't able to find the broader section of this, I guess. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=33.4s)]
*  But this is Russell Brand clipped this sort of like I was kind of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=36.32s)]
*  I thought he's going to be joking in his defense of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=42.06s)]
*  of Jerry Seinfeld being hit with a protester, saying, taking a selfie [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=45.36s)]
*  and then saying free Palestine. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=50.1s)]
*  And then Jerry Seinfeld says something we all know, Jerry. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=51.22s)]
*  He doesn't care about Palestine. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=54.96s)]
*  Shock. Amazing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=56.660000000000004s)]
*  But anyway, here is here's Russell Brand's take on this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=58.1s)]
*  The quote tweet thing he tweeted was [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=62.7s)]
*  this is a breach of the selfie contract period. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=65.56s)]
*  Now, I still to my shame, credited Russell Brand thinking [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=68.1s)]
*  he was being sort of tongue in cheek about that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=72.14s)]
*  But well, we'll see. No, no longer. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=74.1s)]
*  Jerry, can I get a selfie? Sure. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=77.3s)]
*  Free Palestine. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=80.06s)]
*  I don't care about Palestine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=83.44s)]
*  That's sad. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=86.64s)]
*  I feel like it's a breach of the selfie contract. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=87.64s)]
*  If you want to get a selfie with Seinfeld, you've got to say [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=91.04s)]
*  I admire of your standup comedy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=93.98s)]
*  I love the show. Selfie. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=96.08s)]
*  Also, though, I've got strong views on the Israel [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=98.58s)]
*  Palestine conflict. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=102.5s)]
*  I'm going to just bring that up in the midst of this. Very good. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=104.58s)]
*  Strong views. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  First of all, him saying the Israel-Palestine conflict is telling it in of itself. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=109.5s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=113.18s)]
*  Before he was essentially compromised by rumble and all this stuff [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=114.12s)]
*  because of his sexual abuse allegations and he can't get his cash any other way. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  There is no way that Russell Brand wouldn't be doing like [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=122.54s)]
*  even what the Dave Smith libertarian guy is doing or what [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=126.34s)]
*  Theo Vaughn is doing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=130.28s)]
*  Joe Rogan called it a genocide. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  But we have this captured [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=134.54000000000002s)]
*  former comedian Russell Brand, venture capitalist asset [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=138.28s)]
*  Russell Brand, who is just completely capitulating. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=141.44s)]
*  I mean, as you say, Matt, like just having some familiarity with his with this work, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=145.24s)]
*  it's like an alien has taken over his body. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=150.04s)]
*  But it's really just that he was such a an abuser of women, allegedly, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  that this is all he has left at this point. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=160.18s)]
*  Also, Jerry, you do care about Palestine because you cared about it enough [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=162.5s)]
*  for you and your wife to fund counter protesters at UCLA [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=166.3s)]
*  or one or USC and forgetting which L.A. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=171.2s)]
*  based college it was to harass the pro-Palestine encampment there. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=173.54s)]
*  They care. He cares a lot about Palestine. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=179.66s)]
*  Just he cares a lot about it, seeing it eliminated. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=182.04s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, I think I'd be curious to survey some of the late 2010s [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=185.2s)]
*  Russell Brand content on Palestine. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  Imagine maybe there was a little bit of more courage there [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  before he was entirely sort of succumbed to right wing influence. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=197.33999999999997s)]
*  But I will say as somebody who and I'm not joking about this, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=201.2s)]
*  I go way back with Russell Brand, including this video here. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=205.33999999999997s)]
*  If you can pull this up, Bradley from 2006, I believe it is [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=210.04s)]
*  Russell Brand episode twenty two of the BBC six music show. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=215.0s)]
*  I've probably listened to all of these back in my back [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=220.5s)]
*  like 15 or so years ago, like a dozen or so times. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  And if I'm being completely honest, I still think a good chunk of it's funny, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  particularly his producer, Matt Morgan. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=230.3s)]
*  But this part has always stuck out to me where his co-host [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=232.94s)]
*  Trevor Locke makes a joke about Russell Brand. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=237.56s)]
*  And before I get to that joke, what he's talking about is Russell [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  was in a coffee shop and was impatient to grab a paper [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  when somebody had bounced their coffee on the paper. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=249.5s)]
*  And Russell just pulled the paper out and it spilled. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=251.86s)]
*  And so they're talking about this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=254.8s)]
*  You can see like it's pretty antisocial behavior. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=256.74s)]
*  But anyway, here's Russell sort of defending himself. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=258.86s)]
*  Go even five seconds back on this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=262.46000000000004s)]
*  And then you hear Trevor Locke come in with a joke and then Russell Brand. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=264.12s)]
*  Not always very the most careful broadcaster. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=268.12s)]
*  In fact, he got fired for being just insanely rude to people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=272.3s)]
*  But here he is a little bit skittish about touching on a certain subject. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=277.0s)]
*  Oh, this happened. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=281.22s)]
*  It was covered in coffee. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=282.5s)]
*  It wasn't his paper. It was a municipal paper. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  He could have asked me, would you mind [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=286.02000000000004s)]
*  lifting up that coffee, young fellow, my lad, while starting to just whip out the paper? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=287.5s)]
*  Sorry, it was Russell's coffee that he was placing on the stack of newspapers [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=291.72s)]
*  that a guy wanted, and the guy started grabbing the paper. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=295.7s)]
*  So Russell bat his coffee all over the guy, which is even more insane than I remember it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=297.66s)]
*  Sorry to me. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  Would you mind lifting up that coffee, young fellow, my lad, while starting to just whip out the paper? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=303.92s)]
*  Not his coffee over because he was he thought, oh, look at them two people. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=308.0s)]
*  Oh, look at them. Look at them damn long hairs. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=311.22s)]
*  I'll take that paper from underneath there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=314.36s)]
*  I'll show them it was boss. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=315.86s)]
*  But we found out it was boss. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=317.0s)]
*  It was me for the first time in my life kicking something with some degree of accuracy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=318.74s)]
*  Yes, show of unreasonable force. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=322.94s)]
*  You know, you are the Israel of pedestrian etiquette. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=324.76s)]
*  Trevor, that's a really complicated issue. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't think we should discuss on this show. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=329.2s)]
*  We don't know about things. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=331.64s)]
*  We've got a little bit more things like that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=333.0s)]
*  It's terrible that there's any war anywhere in the world. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=334.96s)]
*  It's terrible that there's war anywhere in the world. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=336.84s)]
*  I wish everyone could be happy, like me and old cocky, lucky who we love. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  So there it was. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=342.4s)]
*  So you are the Israel of pedestrian etiquette and Russell's brand is that's very complicated. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=343.6s)]
*  I don't think we should get into stuff like that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=348.04s)]
*  Wow, I overestimated it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=350.08s)]
*  I overestimated his I thought that maybe he would have been a bit more, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=352.0s)]
*  you know, I don't know. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=356.4s)]
*  He was somebody who basically said that labor in the UK [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=359.54s)]
*  wasn't delivering enough for working people for him to justify voting for them [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=363.1s)]
*  until Jeremy Corbyn, I would assume that those politics were the line [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=366.94s)]
*  with being pro Palestine. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=370.14s)]
*  He did come out in favor of Miliband, but I mean, ultimately, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=371.1s)]
*  that was where his audience was. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=373.74s)]
*  Yeah. He wasn't ready to turn Tory. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  But can we also just return to the selfie contract thing? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=378.54s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine the level of just entitlement [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=381.8s)]
*  about saying that like we are not as famous as Jerry Seinfeld or famous at all? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  I'm like on the Z list or whatever. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  But we get noticed in public occasionally, get noticed in public [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=395.44s)]
*  and occasionally are asked for a selfie. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=398.1s)]
*  The idea that I would think that there's some sort of contract involved here [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=400.4s)]
*  or there needs to be an exchange of goods or services [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=404.64s)]
*  or an understanding between people is ridiculous. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=408.84s)]
*  If a pro-Israel person had come up to me and said something like, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=411.5s)]
*  yay, Zionism, I wouldn't be bitching about some contract being broken. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=414.44s)]
*  I mean, that's not the problem. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=419.14s)]
*  It's the Zionism. But right. Exactly. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=420.5s)]
*  But that is what brand is relating to another rich comedian there [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=422.53999999999996s)]
*  and essentially saying is like, don't call me out [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=427.74s)]
*  if I'm going to do you the favor of standing to take a photo with you. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=431.2s)]
*  Maybe later we can go back to my hotel room [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=436.4s)]
*  and that'll be a part of my fame contract. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=439.09999999999997s)]
*  But the selfie contract means that you basically shut the hell up [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=442.53999999999996s)]
*  if I'm going to stop and take my time out of the day to have a conversation with you. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=446.34s)]
*  It's so entitled and weird. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=450.2s)]
*  Yeah, we are your betters. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=451.64s)]
*  If you would like to take a selfie with me, you can say how much you admire me. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  And that's it. That's about it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=457.35999999999996s)]
*  That's basically about it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=459.85999999999996s)]
*  Contract law that you're on track. Well, right. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=461.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I would say that maybe Jerry's contract selfie contract [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=465.05999999999995s)]
*  is a little bit different, right? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=468.46s)]
*  He's had some other, you know, issues with, I would say, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=469.96s)]
*  maybe young women himself, perhaps women under the age of 18 [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=476.05999999999995s)]
*  that he may or may not have dated or definitely did date that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=481.21999999999997s)]
*  I just know that when the reporting came out that he was [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=485.0s)]
*  allegedly calling one of them the child. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=488.5s)]
*  Oh, Russell Brand. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=491.85999999999996s)]
*  Oh, yeah, like regardless of what age, regardless of that person was 20 or whatever. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=492.9s)]
*  I don't I don't fully recall, but that's still sick [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=499.64s)]
*  view of somebody that you're sleeping with. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=504.09999999999997s)]
*  I was referring to Jerry and his dating. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=506.46s)]
*  Oh, so that's what I'm saying. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=508.85999999999996s)]
*  More clear. Yeah, sorry. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=510.26s)]
*  I was afraid, but it's hard to pick which of these disgraced. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, Jerry Lusso, but he should be more comedians [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=516.36s)]
*  who have got there earlier, allegedly on dated underage girls. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=519.36s)]
*  Which one of them are we referring to? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=523.84s)]
*  You can also find an interesting phone call from that Russell Brand radio show [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=526.36s)]
*  with what's the Jim Jim will fix it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=529.8s)]
*  The disgraced pedophile. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=533.9s)]
*  I forget what his name is. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=537.26s)]
*  His show was Jim will fix it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=539.24s)]
*  I like I like disgraced pedophile. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=540.5s)]
*  Like at one point, he was an in good standing pedophile. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=543.1s)]
*  Kind of because everyone knew that he was fucking weird, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=546.3s)]
*  including Russell Brand, who called him on the radio show [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=550.1s)]
*  when the guy was out for dinner, bragging about young women [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=553.9s)]
*  being with him and setting him up like it is Jimmy Savile. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=557.74s)]
*  So if you search Jimmy Savile, Russell Brand, yeah, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=561.78s)]
*  kind of weird call to listen to, you know, we're called weird thing. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=564.84s)]
*  That's one of the things that made me unable to continue to repeat [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=569.1s)]
*  my listening of all of these BBC episodes, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=572.8s)]
*  sort of once I became not in my early 20s. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=576.14s)]
*  It is crazy that clip you played where it like I think what people like [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=579.78s)]
*  about Russell Brand is he's like totally erratic energy, you know, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=583.44s)]
*  and then watching him now, it's so like you can tell he's like [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=588.6s)]
*  really controlling what he's saying. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=593.1s)]
*  It's such it's it's hard. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=594.94s)]
*  His show is so hard to watch. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=596.28s)]
*  It's I don't know. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=598.1s)]
*  It's like not even fun to watch because you could tell he's [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=599.28s)]
*  he's watching what he says so closely. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=601.98s)]
*  You can see the depreciated soul just right. Oh, yeah. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=604.0400000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. He's going to have to do a lot of of his yoga and meditations. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=608.0400000000001s)]
*  Yes. As he's completely as he becomes completely spiritually bereft, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=613.24s)]
*  he's turning towards like Christianity in this extremely weird, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=618.1s)]
*  late, late, late convert way. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=622.1s)]

*  Oh, yeah. It might not be the most genuine. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=627.1s)]
*  Yeah. Retrofit grills out here with the holy water. Yeah. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=629.38s)]
*  Trying to trying to assure some of his new audience that, you know, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=634.0400000000001s)]
*  he's not a godless commie or something like that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=637.44s)]
*  All we have to do is flood the zone every day. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=639.84s)]

*  These guys will never will never be able to recover. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=648.44s)]
*  That's Steve Bannon spelling out the strategy overwhelm Americans with news [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=650.94s)]
*  so Trump can quietly push his real agenda. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqxqkKfDYII&t=654.94s)]
