# Mohsen Mahdawi, Student Detained By Trump, Is Freed
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg)
*  And it must have been up in the Vermont prison where Mohsen Mondawi has been held for two [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=0.0s)]
*  weeks now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=8.72s)]
*  On April 14th, he was detained and ordered deported despite not being charged with a [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=10.16s)]
*  crime. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=17.16s)]
*  He was arrested by ICE up in Vermont. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=18.16s)]
*  He was attending a naturalization interview. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=21.34s)]
*  It was basically a setup. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=26.38s)]
*  Sounded like he's got an interview and then arrest him. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=28.9s)]
*  He argued that he was being unlawfully detained in retaliation for his speech advocating for [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=34.5s)]
*  Palestinian human rights. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=38.82s)]
*  And that it is a part of a policy intended to silence and chill the speech of those who [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=41.98s)]
*  advocate for Palestinian rights. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=47.18s)]
*  And according to the Trump administration, they need to deport him because his presence [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=51.14s)]
*  in the US would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=57.3s)]
*  compelling US foreign policy interest. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=62.86s)]
*  Very powerful dude. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=67.1s)]
*  Just department included a two page letter from Marco Rubio, secretary of state saying [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=75.02s)]
*  Mondawi's activities and presence in the US undermines US policy to combat anti-Semitism. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=78.58s)]
*  His activities could potentially undermine the peace process underway in the Middle [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=89.98s)]
*  East. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=93.82s)]
*  Last week the Vermont Senate voted to condemn the manner and circumstances of Mondawi's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=97.74s)]
*  address. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=104.42s)]
*  Today a federal judge in Vermont, this is what was happening outside of the penitentiary [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=105.42s)]
*  I guess or the federal building. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=116.14s)]
*  That's a lot of people for Vermont. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=135.42s)]
*  Six people. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=142.42s)]
*  Here is Mondawi coming out of the president because he was in that group shot there too. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=145.82s)]
*  We will not fear anyone because our fight is a fight for love, is a fight for democracy, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=154.82s)]
*  is a fight for humanity. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=161.02s)]
*  And I am saying it clear and loud. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=168.62s)]
*  To President Trump and his cabinet, I am not afraid of you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=174.86s)]
*  No fear, no fear, no fear, no fear, no fear, no fear, no fear, no fear, no fear, no fear, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=191.02s)]
*  no fear, no fear. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=210.02s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=211.02s)]
*  And if there is no fear, what is it replaced with? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=212.02s)]
*  Love. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=217.02s)]
*  Love is our way. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=218.02s)]
*  A national security threat to me. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=222.02s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=224.02s)]
*  We don't want one of those love bombs to drop on one of our allies. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=225.02s)]
*  I'm glad at the very least he's been released. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  We'll go through due process and it's also going to be interesting. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=238.74s)]
*  I mean these are the things that the administration is afraid of because you're going to have [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=242.70000000000002s)]
*  to make their case in a court of law. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=246.3s)]
*  This is not just about sending a letter that is going to be rather insufficient. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  They're going to have to prove how protests about U.S. foreign policy and somehow is a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=252.94s)]
*  national security threat or inhibits U.S. foreign policy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=260.74s)]
*  I mean here's the bottom line. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  If they can prove they're only looking to get rid of, you know, to deport him, to take [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=270.02s)]
*  away his visa and they're doing it under the auspices that his presence and activities [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=274.85999999999996s)]
*  have a serious adverse foreign policy consequence and could compromise a compelling foreign [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=286.85999999999996s)]
*  policy interest. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=293.34s)]
*  If you just measure his actions and they say that this is in the reason why they say [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=296.94s)]
*  this is because their foreign policy goal is to fight anti-Semitism, this anti-Semitism [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=305.86s)]
*  law they're putting into in the Senate right now they may vote on. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=312.3s)]
*  You don't think they can find a punishment for American citizens who engage in the exact [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=319.46s)]
*  activity. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=324.34000000000003s)]
*  Just to be clear here, there's two parts of this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=329.94s)]
*  There is the so-called punishment but there's also the liability. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=335.94s)]
*  If the government can establish there is a liability associated with protesting U.S. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=340.42s)]
*  foreign policy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=350.85999999999996s)]
*  That seems pretty problematic to me. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zS938awRQg&t=355.26s)]
