Noah Kulwin to discuss the ongoing protests against Israel.

Noah Kulwin then joins, first touching on his experience taking part in the JVP protest at Trump Tower in New York over the Trump Administration’s disappearing of Columbia student activist Mahmoud Khalil, before diving deeper into the clear and thorough connection between the US’ support for fascism abroad and the descent into fascism at home, as we watch Israel resume its genocide on the Palestinian people while legal residents are picked up off the street by plain-clothes officers over pro-Palestinian speech – a Tufts student the most recent. Expanding on the global context for our current moment, Kulwin also touches on the particular role of the War on Terror in bolstering the rapid expansion of our surveillance state amid xenophobic, nationalist fervor. After expanding on the role of Jewish organizing in standing up to this fascist crackdown, Noah wraps up by emphasizing the need to Get Organized! what that means, and how to go about it at this moment.

*  To say to organize a group of people who would be willing to risk arrest in trump tower the idea was [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=34.88s)]
*  To call attention to the deportation of mamoud khalili [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=41.6s)]

*  details in all cases are and most of these cases now are difficult to come by and all of this is of course in addition to the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=229.18s)]
*  uh, you know the proceedings still underway to get mahmoud khalil out of the country in which all of you know [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=236.32s)]
*  All of their appeals and ongoing litigation for all of these but uh, it's a really staggering [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=241.92s)]
*  wave of repression [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  That the country has not seen since the mccarthy era [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=249.44s)]
*  Yes, it absolutely is let's let's I want to ask if you can expand on the historical parallels to the mccarthy era [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=253.83999999999997s)]
*  In just a second, but since we're on this subject, uh this footage of uh, tough student [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=261.84s)]
*  Uh runesa ozturk basically being taken by dhs agents. I guess that's who they are. They could be ice [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=268.64000000000004s)]
*  Dhs, we don't know they're in plain clothes just like uh that you know marvel freak that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=276.0s)]
*  Arrested mahmoud khalil that footage [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  Shows that they're basically dressed as civilians [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=286.24s)]
*  You don't need to go far to find historical parallels for secret police dressed as civilians [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  The gestapo also operated in this way and um, here's this footage and you can hear her kind of screaming in terror [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=294.8s)]
*  um before [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=303.52s)]
*  This is bogus law who has this footage who's been doing some great work [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=305.36s)]
*  Uh, daniel bogus law and according to her lawyer. She's now been flown to that. Louisiana ice facility where khalil was taken [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=309.76s)]
*  So [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=324.56s)]
*  They're also covering your faces they're all yeah, they're their faces. I take those masks off. Yeah [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=334.4s)]
*  A reminder that in nassau county, is this a kidnapping? Okay. Sorry. This guy's narrating too, but i'll talk about this. Uh [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=346.08s)]
*  When the video is over [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=354.56s)]
*  Yeah, you don't look like it why are you hiding your faces? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=357.68s)]
*  Why are you hiding your faces? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=362.56s)]
*  Can I see some faces here how do I know this is the police? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  Seems like bullshit to me [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=380.88s)]
*  Certainly looks like it [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=383.92s)]
*  All right. So there it is. That's the footage of her being taken and um what I was you know for the podcast audience [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=385.92s)]
*  What I was saying a little bit there is you can hear the person taking the video narrating it [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=392.8s)]
*  But in nassau county, new york, they just banned face masks [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=397.6s)]
*  Because they said that it's hiding the faces of pro-palestine [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=401.76s)]
*  Demonstrators they did this last year. Um, so [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=406.46s)]
*  They did this last year. Um, but you know if you're [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=409.12s)]
*  Working on behalf of the federal government and you're supposed to be identifying yourself [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=412.96s)]
*  Um [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=417.92s)]
*  Now it's all cool. You can hide your face basically from people that are trying to record you [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=418.96s)]
*  Picking up and disappearing somebody for political speech [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=424.16s)]
*  Just your reaction noah [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=430.72s)]
*  Yeah, I I think you know you asked me before the break about parallels to the mccarthy era [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=433.44000000000005s)]
*  And and I think that's something there that is sort of worth like expressing was that in that day [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  Obviously at the height of the cold war in the middle of the korean war [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  um, you know a few years after a democratic president had just had passed through a [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=448.56s)]
*  A a federal service of federal employee loyalty oath act [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=453.68s)]
*  Um, you know this there was all of this anti-communist fervor and they went and sought to denaturalize and deport citizens [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=458.08s)]
*  uh for their political [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=464.64s)]
*  beliefs [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=467.28s)]
*  uh for their political associations [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=468.32s)]
*  and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  I think that in this way, obviously [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=472.08s)]
*  The people being targeted are not um citizens and that's part of why they're being targeted because there is a perceived legal vulnerability [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=475.35999999999996s)]
*  that these people have [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  Uh in you know, obviously what I think by any sensible standard is constitutionally protected activity [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=485.12s)]
*  But because they're not citizens, they don't enjoy those protections. And so in a lot of ways, it's actually in a real intensification [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=490.88s)]
*  um, you know using [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=498.48s)]
*  uh sort of built on top of the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=500.72s)]
*  Crazy anti-immigrant apparatus that we've constructed since you know creating the department of homeland security [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=503.52s)]
*  Um, this really onerous, uh and crazy architecture is now being wielded in this like, uh, very politicized way [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=509.76s)]
*  um, and can you talk a little bit more about that because [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=517.44s)]
*  The department of homeland security ice. I mean you and I are both older than those agencies and uh, I i'm [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=521.84s)]
*  I'm very slowly because i'm just you know reading a few different things, but i'm reading richards beck [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=529.6s)]
*  Richard beck's book homeland and i've been citing it where he basically he does make this argument that the trump administration [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=535.12s)]
*  and the moment that we're in is a culmination of [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=542.08s)]
*  The war on terror and frankly the erosion of our rights [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=545.76s)]
*  uh under that and the expansion of the surveillance state which is [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=549.52s)]
*  They also been contracted out to the likes of peter teal and other people that are [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=555.12s)]
*  Big power players within this administration. It feels like we are at that kind of point where [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  um [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=567.0400000000001s)]

*  dhs, etc [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=569.26s)]
*  Are is being weaponized by him in this very explicitly political way that couldn't have happened if there wasn't kind of a bipartisan [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=570.96s)]
*  Support for this apparatus in the wake of 9 11 [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=579.84s)]
*  Absolutely. I think in general [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=583.5s)]
*  the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=586.64s)]
*  Idea, you know the the idea is obviously not to say that like well because of 9 11 we now have deportations like this [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=587.92s)]
*  it's not quite you know, there's there's a lot of things that have happened and a lot of uh, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  it takes like a you know, this is a [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=599.1999999999999s)]
*  A radical political social development, you know, it's it's not but but I think richard beck is correct to emphasize in his very good book [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=602.8s)]
*  Um is the idea that like the war on terror? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=610.8s)]
*  Was a shot in the arm that built the institutions and that used the currents of popular consent [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=614.64s)]
*  Derived in those, you know early 2000s years to build again these institutions that were novel [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=621.84s)]
*  And that have in a matter of you know, 20 years [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=628.72s)]
*  uh insinuated themselves into [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=631.26s)]
*  Really, you know the critical spaces [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  Of our of our of our lives of our society [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  um [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=641.0400000000001s)]
*  I think it's you know, there's a [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=642.1600000000001s)]
*  equality to me of this that is uh, especially heinous because [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=645.2800000000001s)]
*  Of course, you know, this is what we're describing [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=650.4000000000001s)]
*  Is like one piece of a repression that was obviously meted out around the whole globe [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=653.2800000000001s)]
*  And the war on terror was a global war on terror [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=659.0400000000001s)]
*  but [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like it's not to say that like to to use this to obscure that but just to say that this is you know [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  Uh one part of this like larger [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  Uh like story all over the world waves of repression and governments that we've armed [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=673.68s)]
*  And that we've developed military relationships and so on with that have helped make the world the way that it is [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=678.72s)]
*  That is uh produce the slaughter in gaza, for example [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=683.68s)]
*  um, you know, I think something that people maybe forget uh, perhaps is that uh, benjamin nantanyahu [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=687.36s)]
*  Uh was one of the star witnesses before congress testifying on behalf of the iraq war. Yeah [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=694.08s)]
*  And you know a moment a moment after 9 11 when he said how good this is going to be for us and he smiled and then [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=700.4s)]
*  Immediately took it back. Oh, yeah. Well he he he has [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=706.08s)]
*  I mean he's the he's he's gotten a lot better about not ever doing stuff like that in public anymore [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=710.4s)]
*  He's a pretty smooth character. But the moment I will you know, he [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=714.88s)]
*  you know, he's uh [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=718.48s)]
*  He argues he just he goes before congress and he endorses, um [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=720.48s)]
*  The cause full forward three full-throatedly [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=726.16s)]
*  Uh and casts himself as an expert on terror and we sort of live in the world [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=729.3000000000001s)]
*  Uh live in a world in part sculpted very determinately by uh people who think that way [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=733.86s)]
*  I think one other element that I would I would kind of add to this though, uh, you know [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=742.26s)]
*  Just from firsthand experience, of course is also the physical relationships obviously institutions hiring people. Yeah, that's physical [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=746.1s)]
*  Trust me. It feels practically proctological if you go on a flight these days, am I right? But [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=753.38s)]
*  There is I do think you know, there it's not a joke [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=758.34s)]
*  It's not a twitter meme that like the the equipment and the the actual means of policing as a result of these last 25 years [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=761.7s)]
*  have also developed [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=769.38s)]
*  in a really uh [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=771.14s)]
*  Um [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=774.74s)]
*  How to put it like they've also developed in this, uh, you know really uh pervasive and create in an astonishing way [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=777.38s)]
*  Um when I was at columbia the night that they raided and cleared out, uh, hinn hall, um [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=785.22s)]
*  Hamilton hall in 1968 which was occupied by activists and this really brutal [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=792.1800000000001s)]
*  Uh police raid, uh, they sent this gigantic black truck. I mean it looked like something out of [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=796.74s)]
*  Like uh like a verhoeven movie or like the the truck or the the vehicle from aliens like it was it was astonishing [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=803.78s)]
*  And they you know, and this is to root out a bunch of kids a bunch of students inside a building [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=811.54s)]
*  And they raised this ladder and they all go up with stuff [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=817.0600000000001s)]
*  And you know, I mean like a gun went off apparently in there [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=819.78s)]
*  They you know, like I heard a story about a student being thrown down being, you know, so one student just thrown downstairs [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=821.86s)]
*  I mean, it's truly uh, you know, it was vicious and it was you know with this like piece of equipment that uh, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=827.94s)]
*  is I guess part of why like, you know is [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=834.58s)]
*  like [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=837.46s)]
*  is is itself like a [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=838.1800000000001s)]
*  Something that just would not have existed in a pre-war on terror era or at least uh, I think its deployment would have been [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=840.26s)]
*  Uh sort of less common and less obvious [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=847.2199999999999s)]
*  I mean hell the strategic resources group that handles all of these uh, you know that arrested me [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=849.3s)]
*  and is also a major part of containing protests is itself like [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=854.66s)]
*  uh [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=858.42s)]
*  A creation of this era the nypd's muslim surveillance squad. Yep [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=859.3s)]
*  Um that operated for many years and i'm sure still operates in some form despite being under legal sanction [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=862.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, um, it's also you can talk about police brutality and the militarization of our police force [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=869.38s)]
*  as a continuation of that as well because they you know, there was a lot of [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=875.38s)]
*  Defense contractors that got rich and they couldn't even use all of the equipment that they made [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=880.5s)]
*  And so what where does the leftover war on terror equipment go while it goes to your local police force? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=884.5799999999999s)]
*  And when they have the toys they're going to use them. Um, and so [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=890.02s)]
*  I think uh [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=894.5s)]
*  There it's it's it's not a [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=896.74s)]
*  An easy narrative to like fully wrap your head around but there's the the the reason we're here [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=900.98s)]
*  We can we can go back and and trace it and it's very much what you describe [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=906.3399999999999s)]
*  when you talk about [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=912.18s)]
*  The the protests in columbia back, uh, I guess a year ago now [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=914.02s)]
*  and [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=919.62s)]
*  how columbia is at the center of [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=920.98s)]
*  Basically this capitulation to donald trump how [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=924.5799999999999s)]
*  After the genocide began they banned two student activist groups including jewish voices for peace on their campus [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=928.74s)]
*  with claims of anti-semitism [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=935.6999999999999s)]
*  I i'm just baffled and it's naive [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=938.8199999999999s)]
*  But when I read these newspaper articles where they vaguely talk about how jewish students feel unsafe on campus and they're referring to [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=942.66s)]
*  Zionist students who are excluded from the protests because they're there to stir shit up [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=949.06s)]
*  Jews jews are disproportionately represented in these demonstrations based on just like my experience of going to protests [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=954.7399999999999s)]
*  There are a lot of jewish people who want to say [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=962.7399999999999s)]
*  This is not in our name and it doesn't get reflected in the news coverage whatsoever [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=965.9399999999999s)]
*  And my guess is just like in terms of the percentage of the population [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=971.14s)]
*  And if you looked at the percentage of people who are doing these demonstrations [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=974.9799999999999s)]
*  Jews would be overrepresented [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=978.58s)]
*  In all of them, but that doesn't get reflected in the media coverage of this whatsoever [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=981.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I I think the idea is that they want to cast jews and muslims as monoliths and to create simple us and them narratives [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=986.42s)]
*  That are you know, reinforced what tend to be? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=994.1s)]
*  uh the frame the the the frames the biases [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=997.46s)]
*  uh through you know that that shape how the people who tell these kinds of stories and the people who [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1000.98s)]
*  Will power view this? Uh, because I think that that's uh [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1007.3s)]
*  That's more or less how I I I do feel that there is like uh, you know like you're [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1012.9s)]
*  It's you know, like there are plenty of people I meet who are they're like wait a jewish guy who's pro-palestine [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1019.14s)]
*  Right and I get it, you know, like it's it's um [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1025.06s)]
*  Like the world we inhabit unfortunately like a major task of our time [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1028.5s)]
*  Is is you know to be anti-essentialist to say that no [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1033.54s)]
*  Not everybody who is a certain thing necessarily thinks a certain way who's of a certain background [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1037.46s)]
*  um [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1042.74s)]
*  I think where it's with columbia what makes it difficult is that the organized jewish community at columbia? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1044.18s)]
*  And the influential trustees and donors the people who actually [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1051.14s)]
*  Hold power at columbia and in student life evidently [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1055.78s)]
*  um [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1060.34s)]
*  They want to actively make criticism of israel the same thing as anti-semitism [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1061.54s)]
*  Uh in in in life in in law in code of conduct [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1067.54s)]
*  uh, and and that's their mission and it's you know, it's I it's obviously one that I uh, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1072.98s)]
*  I fight with every fiber of my being but [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1078.18s)]
*  That's what they want [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1081.22s)]
*  and [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1082.82s)]
*  I don't necessarily feel [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1083.78s)]
*  that [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1086.42s)]
*  there is like a um [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1087.7s)]
*  Uh [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1089.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't necessarily feel that what has happened at columbia for example [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1093.46s)]
*  um [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1097.78s)]
*  Was you know that like, you know like I understand and and and in a larger sense it is totally true columbia capitulated [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1098.74s)]
*  columbia [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1106.48s)]
*  Uh failed its students. It failed its community [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1107.6200000000001s)]
*  Uh, it failed at its mission of being an institution of higher learning a university if that word is to mean anything [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1111.3s)]
*  um [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1118.42s)]
*  but it also [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1119.54s)]
*  Sought to be an active collaborator [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1121.3s)]
*  Uh of the trump administration as you know with these people with power chose and chose to be an active enforcer of this to sustain this conflation [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1124.34s)]
*  Because that's what they want to believe and a huge and not insignificant part of shaping that effort has been [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1132.02s)]
*  the major american jewish establishment [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1137.7s)]
*  And I think that it's going to have to be like, you know [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1140.42s)]
*  the task of jews like myself and you know for for people everywhere to sort of convey and help understand that [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1143.06s)]
*  the [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1148.74s)]
*  Uh establishment does not necessarily reflect how all jews feel it doesn't mean that jews are a certain way [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1149.78s)]
*  And and moreover that in fact I view this conflation as itself an anti-semitic act [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1156.66s)]
*  That as the years go on [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1163.14s)]
*  Uh as israeli crimes continue and as you know columbia tamps down dissent under the name of anti-semitic [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1165.38s)]
*  uh, you know, uh [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1172.8200000000002s)]
*  Student safety and so on [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1175.46s)]
*  You know, it's it's it is a conflation that will sustain and generate anti-semitism [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1179.14s)]
*  Uh, and yeah, I mean it's undeniable to me the trump administration [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1184.1000000000001s)]
*  Diving right into this conflation should probably give some people some cues. This is shalom my mood [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1190.26s)]
*  Yeah, well, oh, yeah that got me that got my blood boiling. I think yeah, that was tough [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1197.22s)]
*  That that's what for people who aren't, you know, hopelessly online like the three of us here [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1202.26s)]
*  Um, the white house, uh tweeted shalom [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1207.3000000000002s)]
*  When they uh arrested him and you that's like stephen miller doing that by the way who is a white nationalist [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1212.18s)]
*  That's clearly coming from him [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1218.02s)]
*  and you see how [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1220.1000000000001s)]
*  Zionism fits in quite nicely with our most far-right movements because even though stephen miller and trump are deeply anti-semitic [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1222.64s)]
*  What they admire about israel is its ethnic ethnostate [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1231.0600000000002s)]
*  Uh nature, it's the same way you can hear [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1234.5s)]
*  uh open white supremacists like uh praising praising israel like richard spencer because [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1236.98s)]
*  They like that. They are enforcing their ethnic purity through violence and that is their kind of vision for what they want [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1242.26s)]
*  Really america and other nation states to be like, um, so I guess for my my final question for you [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1249.3s)]
*  Noah is like with all of that said and with this administration [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1255.1399999999999s)]
*  Um, you know, they're going to be in power for the next three and a half years-ish, uh, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1260.36s)]
*  And hopefully not after that, but we don't know. Um, you know, what are the challenges that are presented? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1267.24s)]
*  In protesting for palestine under this administration because if you are here on a green card or you're here as a student [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1274.92s)]
*  Obviously, we know what's what's happening, right and everybody needs to be wearing masks [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1281.3999999999999s)]
*  Masks masks masks face coverings [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1286.36s)]
*  But yeah, you know, you're you're a u.s citizen, right? Like there's different challenges [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1289.6399999999999s)]
*  But what would be your kind of message of of how we should be approaching our advocacy for palestine? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1294.52s)]
*  um [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1301.0s)]
*  in this moment [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1301.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, I think you know the um [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1304.28s)]
*  When like I will say what everybody says which is get organized [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1307.1599999999999s)]
*  But I will attempt to at least go a little bit further than the mere tweet [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1312.6s)]
*  Uh or or facebook post or ig post and and tell you what I mean by that [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1317.8000000000002s)]
*  so [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1322.6000000000001s)]
*  This action at trump tower, for example, which was able to draw a lot of press attention [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1323.5600000000002s)]
*  Probably made him at least a little mad for like 15 seconds. But again was you know, uh a basis for [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1327.8000000000002s)]
*  You know some kind of demonstration that a group of people are willing to commit and willing to [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1334.3600000000001s)]
*  You know devote their bodies for a few hours to you know to to show and to draw attention [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1339.88s)]
*  To what the hell's going on [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1346.52s)]
*  Um, then you know what I mean by get organized is that I was reached out to for that [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1348.52s)]
*  Uh by somebody who was connected to jvp [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1352.6799999999998s)]
*  And i'm a part of jvp. Yeah, but like, you know somebody had to like think like oh, he would be a good guy for this [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1355.56s)]
*  And they did that because like they knew i'm, you know committed and interested and that's because of things that i'd said and done [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1362.6s)]
*  That showed them that and you know that like it was you know, whether it's the conversations you have with somebody like it's the the your [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1369.56s)]
*  Friends that you've known for a while who just like know you're a real one [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1375.8000000000002s)]
*  And you know you you should leverage those relationships [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1379.4s)]
*  Um to try and get close to the action and you know and and to sort of you know [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1383.5600000000002s)]
*  Be be conscious of wherever you are like who's doing the thing that I most want to be a part of [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1387.48s)]
*  And if nobody's doing that who is doing something that I want to be a part of somewhere else and what can I learn from them? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1392.52s)]
*  um, I think you know, it's it's [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1398.76s)]
*  It's understandable to want like a really simple road map [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1402.1200000000001s)]
*  um, but I think that you know, it really does kind of just have to start with like finding other people and and working with them [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1405.8000000000002s)]
*  People who share your values and who you think like have integrity and can do stuff on time and not flake out [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1413.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, it's it's um, it's kind of on that level [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1419.5600000000002s)]
*  And the only thing I would add to that, you know is and sort of how you initially sort of framed the question [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1423.16s)]
*  Emma, which is you know, like there's a lot of risk ahead, you know, there's always risk. Um, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1427.48s)]
*  And some of that is pretty low risk [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1433.72s)]
*  What I did I think was pretty low risk [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1435.8s)]
*  uh [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1438.04s)]
*  but [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1439.16s)]
*  There are things that involve more risk and I think that people can sort of figure out for themselves [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1440.04s)]
*  You know how much risk are they willing to take how much time are they willing to commit? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1446.44s)]
*  um, because oftentimes I do think that you know, there's uh, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1451.0s)]
*  While there are those of us who uh for whatever reasons, uh for whatever abilities or lack thereof or immigration status [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1456.1200000000001s)]
*  Um are not able to participate in this in this action, you know the question for somebody to ask themselves as well [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1463.72s)]
*  There are others who may not be able to give but [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1470.52s)]
*  What can I? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1473.56s)]
*  Well said no, I really appreciate you coming on today and everybody as always check out blowback [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9Re44t84c&t=1475.96s)]
