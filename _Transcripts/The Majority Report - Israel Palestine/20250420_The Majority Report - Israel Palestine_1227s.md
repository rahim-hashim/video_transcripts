# Mohsen Mahdawi Spoke Out For Peace, Then ICE Took Him...
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c)
*  Mohsen Madhawi spoke to CBS News and this was on Sunday, recorded on Sunday, the day [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=0.0s)]
*  before he was taken by immigration officials, cops, the day before he was detained. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=8.58s)]
*  He was Russ, the guy that showed up to his hearing, right? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=18.76s)]
*  So he was, we don't know if this was a sham immigration hearing, honestly, because they're [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=22.34s)]
*  trying to meet their quotas, but he was doing everything right, Mohsen Madhawi. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=27.98s)]
*  He's Palestinian, he's spoken out against the slaughter, but he is explicitly a peace [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=33.5s)]
*  activist and he went to go to his immigration hearing and was scooped up and disappeared [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=39.22s)]
*  by ICE officials. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=44.7s)]
*  And you mentioned the hearing thing is so important because JD Vance and a lot of these [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=45.94s)]
*  guys and well, we've actually been so overwhelmed that we can't do the courts are overwhelmed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  They're literally intervening in court dates that have already been scheduled to snatch [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=54.58s)]
*  people up. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=60.5s)]
*  The idea that they respect or that this is all motivated by course being overwhelmed [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=61.5s)]
*  is just a lie. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=65.14s)]
*  It's a lie and they're also using some of the systems that they put in place to formalize [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=66.28s)]
*  like the files or keep track of people who are here in this country without documentation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=74.02s)]
*  or who may be applying for asylum. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=79.78s)]
*  They are using those tools to now target those folks, including the Social Security number [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=81.84s)]
*  program that Trump set up in his first term, which allowed people who were here without [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=86.36s)]
*  documentation to apply for non voting Social Security cards so they could use that maybe [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=92.2s)]
*  as a piece of evidence. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=97.88s)]
*  Like I'm a good person. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=99.72s)]
*  I want to be a citizen one day or maybe if they need a driver's license or some other [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=100.84s)]
*  kind of government documentation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=105.16s)]
*  Right now, Trump 2.0 is using that program to zero in on these people and target them [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=107.42s)]
*  like they're criminals when they were all trying to do the right thing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=112.7s)]
*  But it's important to play this because they're claiming this guy's a terrorist and it seems [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  like they probably saw this footage or knew this was happening or knew he was speaking [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=121.3s)]
*  out. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure about the timeline. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  I gave a 60 minutes interview previous to this, which is I think what he according to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=128.02s)]
*  what put him on the lists of all those hardcore Zionist organizations saying, and this is [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=134.42000000000002s)]
*  a separate CBS interview. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  Yes, this was a previous interview. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=141.06s)]
*  It was like a few weeks prior to when to when this interview was recorded. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=142.62s)]
*  So here he is explaining in his own words what his activism means. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  Poverty are much more tied. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=153.06s)]
*  American people are realizing now that there is strong correlation between the injustice [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=156.66000000000003s)]
*  that's happening in Palestine and the injustice that's happening here and the attack on free [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=163.34s)]
*  speech. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=170.54s)]
*  There's an appointment that you're showing up to. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=171.54s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  What is this appointment for and when did it come in? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  This appointment is for my citizenship application, the M-400 application, which is a naturalization [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=179.74s)]
*  process. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=188.14000000000001s)]
*  It was scheduled on March, I believe, 27. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=189.73999999999998s)]
*  After your name has been out there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=197.14s)]
*  And during my time sheltering in place. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=198.14s)]
*  Is this an appointment you've been waiting for for years? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=202.38s)]
*  I've been waiting for this appointment since February of 2024. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=205.94s)]
*  It was expected to be the window for it between November and January. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=212.14s)]
*  When you got the appointment, what were your thoughts? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=220.14s)]
*  My mind went, I mean, mixed feelings, right? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=224.94s)]
*  It's the first feeling of like, I've been waiting for this for more than a year. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=231.14s)]
*  And the other feeling is like, wait a minute, is this a honey trap? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=237.44s)]
*  You mean you think they could be calling you in to detain you? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=244.44s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=250.44s)]
*  If that's the case, why was it important for you to speak with us before showing up there? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=251.44s)]
*  Because I believe that this story is very important for the American people. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=258.44s)]
*  Because I believe that if I get detained tomorrow, Monday, this detention would be [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=265.44s)]
*  unjust and unfair and in violation of the principles of this country. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=273.44s)]
*  When you think about perhaps the Khalil case where he was taken at night and we were not [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=280.44s)]
*  able to hear from him after, what do you want people to hear from you in the case that you [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=287.44s)]
*  are detained? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=293.44s)]
*  I want people to know that the work and the activism that we have done was centered in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=295.44s)]
*  the energy of love. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=307.44s)]
*  We did it because of our love for humanity, our love for justice, our love for human rights. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=310.44s)]
*  And I want people to know that my compassion extended beyond the Palestinian people. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=319.44s)]
*  My compassion is also for the Jewish people and for the Israelis as well. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=329.44s)]
*  So people need to actually look at both sides and figure out what is the truth. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=337.44s)]
*  Because the accusation that the Palestinian cause and the pro-Palestinian movement at [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=344.44s)]
*  Columbia was anti-Semitic is a false accusation. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=352.44s)]
*  And it is unjust accusation. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=357.44s)]
*  You've had time to think about what's happening to you and others. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=360.44s)]
*  What do you think is the ultimate goal? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=364.44s)]
*  The ultimate goal, as I see it, is censoring people, preventing them from sharing their [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=367.44s)]
*  truth and controlling them by fear. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=375.44s)]
*  You say you're not hiding, you're sheltering in place, but people don't know where you are. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=378.44s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=383.44s)]
*  Because basically there is, I'm in Jebrity. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=385.44s)]
*  I mean my freedom is in Jebrity. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=391.44s)]
*  And courts have not ruled yet on this situation clearly. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=395.44s)]
*  I believe that the track will be corrected, but now it's a matter of time. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=400.44s)]
*  It's a storm. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=407.44s)]
*  The way how I see it, this is a storm. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=409.44s)]
*  When there is a strong storm, we shelter. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=412.44s)]
*  When the storm is over, we go out again. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=415.44s)]
*  The storm is not over and you're showing up to this meeting. Why? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=419.44s)]
*  Because I believe in the cause, the Palestinian cause, and I believe in justice. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=423.44s)]
*  This meeting, because tomorrow, could be actually the day where the storm might take me away. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=428.44s)]
*  And then my voice may not be heard for a very long time. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=437.44s)]
*  So I am giving this interview because I have faith. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=443.44s)]
*  I have faith in the people who have open hearts and who don't want to shut their eyes, who want to see the truth for what it is. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=448.44s)]
*  My people are dying. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=459.44s)]
*  My family has suffered. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=462.44s)]
*  My cousins, six cousins have been killed. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=465.44s)]
*  My uncle, I saw him killed in front of my eyes as a child. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=470.44s)]
*  My best friend was shot in front of my eyes. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=476.44s)]
*  I was shot in my leg. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=481.44s)]
*  And all of these efforts are there to silence me, to say nothing about these stories that deserve to be heard. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=484.44s)]
*  What a brave, incredible person. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=496.44s)]
*  All these kids, I keep saying them kids, but like, you know, just because I'm like, I was in his 30s. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=501.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. I mean, I just this Mahmoud Khalil also a letter from Mahmoud Khalil in the ICE detention center in Louisiana. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=507.44s)]
*  I just want to read a little bit of this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=515.44s)]
*  The incarceration of 70,000 Japanese American citizens is a reminder that rhetoric of justice and freedom obscures reality that all too often America has been a democracy of convenience. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=517.44s)]
*  The rights are granted for those who align with power for the poor, the people of color, for those who resist injustice. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=526.44s)]
*  Rights are but words written on water. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=531.44s)]
*  The right to free speech when it comes to Palestine has always been exceptionally weak. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=533.44s)]
*  Even so, the crackdown on universities and students reveals just how afraid the White House is of the idea of Palestine's freedom entering the mainstream. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=537.44s)]
*  Why else would Trump officials not only attempt to deport me, but also intentionally mislead the public about who I am and what I stand for? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=543.44s)]
*  Same thing with the Muslim and Dowie here. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=551.44s)]
*  The next letter concludes, I write this letter as the sun rises, hoping that the suspension of my rights will raise alarm bells that yours are already in jeopardy. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=555.44s)]
*  I hope it will inspire your outrage at the most basic human instinct to protest shameless massacres being repressed by obscure laws, racist propaganda and a state terrified of an awakened public. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=563.44s)]
*  I hope this writing will startle you into understanding that a democracy for some, a democracy of convenience, is no democracy at all. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=574.44s)]
*  I hope it will shake you into acting before it is too late. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=581.44s)]
*  These are modern day freedom fighters, heroes. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=586.44s)]
*  He understood what he was facing. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=591.44s)]
*  But as he says towards the end, he's faced worse. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=596.44s)]
*  He's been shot. He's seen his family killed in front of him, his best friend killed in front of him. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=600.44s)]
*  He's not afraid. He's not going to be afraid of these fascists. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=607.44s)]
*  And it's our responsibility to stand up for him. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=610.44s)]
*  Madhavi has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States for 10 years. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=613.44s)]
*  He went in for that naturalization interview in Vermont where his permanent residence is. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=618.44s)]
*  He is explicitly a peace activist who has been working with Jewish students on. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=624.44s)]
*  Columbia's campus, Madhavi 34, who was active in Buddhist affairs on campus, worked to form a broad based coalition of advocates for peace in both Israel and Gaza, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=632.44s)]
*  even as other pro-Palestinian student protesters grew more radical, according to his classmates and associates. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=641.44s)]
*  Madhavi condemned anti-Semitism during public protests and deliberately sought to include Jewish and Israeli students in discussions. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=646.44s)]
*  Last fall, Madhavi began weekly meetings with Israeli students to discuss their upbringing and beliefs about the long simmering Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=653.44s)]
*  as the associate said. He's being more generous than frankly I would be about like I don't necessarily want to hear from Israeli students about their experience, frankly, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=661.44s)]
*  because it's like I don't want to hear about the aggressor's feelings if they're not standing with the people who are being oppressed. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=671.44s)]
*  I would be very impatient with that. I'm not as good of a person as Mohsen Madhavi, who is now rotting in ICE detention, it appears. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=679.44s)]
*  And as a peace activist, that's the problem actually. Because Zionists don't want peace, that's why there can't be a ceasefire or a permanent ceasefire. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=687.44s)]
*  Any ceasefire that Israel proposes is a temporary one, which allows them to reload and allows IDF to go to some raves and rest for a little bit before they start massacring people again. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=696.44s)]
*  The truth is that Zionism is about conquest of an area and removing the people from that area. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=706.44s)]
*  So anybody that says actually we can all coexist in this area is a threat to them. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=712.44s)]
*  And you know, this is all stuff that we've theoretically said the entire time I've been doing this sort of work and talking about BDS laws. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=717.44s)]
*  It's here now and there's no like next step. They're just going to keep. I mean, what are they accusing Madhavi of doing? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=726.44s)]
*  Being a terrorist, I think. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=733.44s)]
*  Insane. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=735.44s)]
*  Insane. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=736.44s)]
*  And that's the thing is like we want we we can all recognize when Bukele calls a Brigo Garcia terrorist that this is a ridiculous use of the term. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=737.44s)]
*  We need to now use that same pattern recognition and apply it to when Zionists claim that they're fighting terrorism because they are not fighting terrorism. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=746.44s)]
*  They are provoking terrorism by fighting a demographic of people whose land they are stealing with war crimes. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=755.44s)]
*  And I also want to be clear about the accusations about the Trump administration. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=761.44s)]
*  Basically, I'm not sure if they're actually explicitly calling him a terrorist. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=768.44s)]
*  The Department of Homeland. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=772.44s)]
*  Aligned with terrorism. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=773.44s)]
*  I think it's anti-Semitism. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=775.44s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we the most updated article we have. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=776.44s)]
*  This is all shrouded in incredible secrecy is from Gothamist. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=779.44s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security has now responded to a request for comment about Madhavi's arrest and I spokesperson referred questions to the Office of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose spokespeople have not responded. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=782.44s)]
*  But a memo from Rubio states that the Trump administration is seeking to deport Madhavi because his activities could be could potentially undermine the Middle East peace process. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=794.44s)]
*  Peace. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=802.44s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=803.44s)]
*  He's literally a peace activist. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=804.44s)]
*  The conquest process is what Rubio means in the Orwellian turn of phrase. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=806.44s)]
*  Kudos. Sorry. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=810.44s)]
*  Kudos to a Congressman Kassar. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=813.44s)]
*  He's one of the Democrats who voted against the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=814.44s)]
*  But that seems to be also, Emma, your point when you're asking him, you know, like, is the conversation changing internally in the Democratic caucus? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=819.44s)]
*  At some point, there has to be a conversation about, you know, overturning that that I'm bored. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=827.44s)]
*  I'm not bored. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=834.44s)]
*  That's such a such a blase way to refer to it. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=835.44s)]
*  I am frustrated by even our most progressive members like Bernie is shouting down Palestine protests at that rally. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=838.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's a shame. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=846.44s)]
*  I want to propagandize for that thing. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=848.44s)]
*  And they're having people taken out because they're putting Palestine flags up by cops. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=850.44s)]
*  Why, dude? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=854.44s)]
*  Like, stop. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=855.44s)]
*  I mean, even the rep repetition of Israel has a right to defend itself. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=857.44s)]
*  Cut that out, too, please. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=861.44s)]
*  And like, I think our the squad members have been better than Sanders on this in terms of like AOC and Ilhan and, of course, Rashida Tlaib early on calling it a genocide, speaking out about Israel. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=863.44s)]
*  But even our most left wing members of Congress are not meeting the reality of what the situation is, which is that we need a South Africa style truth and reconciliation commission after a peace process that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=875.44s)]
*  that reintegrates the territory of Israel into one that is a democratic state for Palestinians and Israelis to live side by side. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=890.44s)]
*  Now, people will say to me, well, you don't think Israel has a right to exist then? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=901.44s)]
*  I mean, I don't necessarily think that's the right construction. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=907.44s)]
*  I think Israelis that are there currently have a right to live in peace unless they're war criminals and they should be tried in court. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=910.44s)]
*  And then we determine make those determinations. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=918.44s)]
*  But so the Palestinians. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=921.44s)]
*  And the question is, is with Israel having taken so much territory, basically, ethnically cleansing the entire Gaza Strip, as is their goal, taking so much of the West Bank and settling there, they have created a one state reality where there's three million people in the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=923.44s)]
*  occupied West Bank who they have complete control over. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=939.44s)]
*  And then they've created an open air concentration camp where they're executing a final solution against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to take that land to create one state. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=942.44s)]
*  There will never be two states. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=951.44s)]
*  Never, ever, ever. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=953.44s)]
*  I mean, I shouldn't say that I shouldn't make predictions. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=954.44s)]
*  There might be as a step to another. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=957.44s)]
*  But like in terms of of the current facts on the ground, as the Israelis would say, it's impossible unless Israel gives up a bunch of land that it's illegally stolen. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=959.44s)]
*  I don't see that coming. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=972.44s)]
*  So the what is the best situation is that we intervene internationally to make sure that we create a state like South Africa where apartheid falls and everybody can have access to that land. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=973.44s)]
*  There are still problems in South Africa. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=987.44s)]
*  The white landowners own like 70 percent of the farmland, for example, that there hasn't been enough done. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=989.44s)]
*  But this is people will say that's impossible. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=995.44s)]
*  No, the current situation is impossible. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=998.44s)]
*  We're paying utopia prices already for apartheid. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1000.44s)]
*  And the thing is, is like, please tell me about Israel's right to exist, because I think it's actually something that the reason it's insisted upon is because it's actually really questionable. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1003.44s)]
*  When we define Israel as a demographic majority of a certain population that wasn't there but could only be produced through conquest and war crimes, which is what Israel has been produced through, doesn't have the right to exist. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1013.44s)]
*  If we want to talk about some hypothetical Israel where everyone within that region is given one vote, one man, one vote, one person, one vote, I would say it's probably a compromise to even call that Israel. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1026.44s)]
*  I would prefer it called Palestine and then also assure the safety of Jews in that region, too. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1039.44s)]
*  I think generally that shouldn't have been the place for refuge. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1044.44s)]
*  I think maybe America should have taken more back in the day. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1047.44s)]
*  But now that this is here, yes, the two state solution is just a fiction harbored by people that want to let Bibi Netanyahu continue to roll over Palestinian bodies. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1050.44s)]
*  It will look like the Bantu stands of South Africa in any kind of scenario. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1061.44s)]
*  It's just very clear that that's what Israel sees as the model. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1068.44s)]
*  That's why they supported South Africa when it was an apartheid state. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1072.44s)]
*  One person, one vote. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1076.44s)]
*  And the problem with that is, and you see this everywhere. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1078.44s)]
*  I remember Robbie Soav being like, well, of course we can't have the right to return. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1082.44s)]
*  There's so many people in media that are just like right to return. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1085.44s)]
*  That's obviously ridiculous. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1088.44s)]
*  Well, the UN doesn't think so. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1090.44s)]
*  And I'll just say like you cannot displace people using. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1092.44s)]
*  Well, if you do displace people permanently and settle ground after conquest, that is a war crime. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1095.44s)]
*  So I don't think war crimes have the right to exist. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1101.44s)]
*  I think that's what modern Israel is, a giant war crime. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1104.44s)]
*  Chris in Texas. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1107.44s)]
*  Israel should be considered an active invasion. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1109.44s)]
*  DSA Aaron in Atlanta. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1111.44s)]
*  No state has the right to exist, especially in apartheid genocidal fascist state. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1113.44s)]
*  Randy Gornberg. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1117.44s)]
*  Do Palestinians have a right to defend themselves? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1119.44s)]
*  Does Palestine have a right to exist? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1121.44s)]
*  Ask these questions every time you hear someone ask about Israel's rights. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1122.44s)]
*  That's the other thing is why I'm pessimistic about the idea of a two state solution as well. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1125.44s)]
*  It's like that wouldn't necessitate Palestine in the second state having a army. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1129.44s)]
*  You think Israel's going to agree to that? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1134.44s)]
*  You think so? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1137.44s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1139.44s)]
*  You know, to this point of the right of return, like I'm Jewish, so I've never you know, I'm not from Israel. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1140.44s)]
*  No one in my immediate family is from Israel. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1147.44s)]
*  My grandparents, my great grandparents, none of us are from Israel. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1149.44s)]
*  But I have a right to go there and become a citizen should I choose one of my best friends growing up from the same suburb I grew up in San Diego. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1152.44s)]
*  His name is Sam. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1161.44s)]
*  Shout out, Sam is Palestinian or Palestinian American. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1162.44s)]
*  And he does not have a right to immigrate to Israel. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1167.44s)]
*  He can't just decide because he feels like it that he wants to up and move there. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1171.44s)]
*  And one more point I wanted to make. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1175.44s)]
*  There was a fringe radical left wing thinker during the Obama years. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1177.44s)]
*  His name was John Kerry, who said famously, Israel can either be a democracy or it can be a Jewish state. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1183.44s)]
*  It can't be both. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1190.44s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1192.44s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1193.44s)]
*  John Kerry, the radical Hamas supporter, the Antifa Secretary of State, the upside down red triangle. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1194.44s)]
*  John Kerry. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1200.44s)]
*  I mean, when I look at him, I just think militant, militant. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1202.44s)]
*  Wait till Hamas gets a windsurfing. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1206.44s)]
*  You [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJUl5WHl1c&t=1223.44s)]
