# This Was Inevitable...
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s)
*  As you guys probably heard, Zoran Mamdani won the Democratic nomination for mayor last week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. Wow. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=7.04s)]
*  You guys were up on that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  This is pretty fascinating because I don't know, Matt, if you remember this back in the day, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=12.68s)]
*  do you remember Indy Mike? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=18.32s)]
*  Sounds familiar. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=21.16s)]
*  Remember those debates with that Indy Mike guy? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=21.96s)]
*  I think we even had him on the show one time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=23.6s)]
*  He was a guy who was sort of like on an email thread with me with other friends. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=26.36s)]
*  OK, I remember. OK, I remember Indy Mike now. Yes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=29.96s)]
*  OK. And Indy Mike would get his news from both sides. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=32.92s)]
*  He would get it both from on one hand, Laura Ingraham, and on the other hand, Brett Baer. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=39.36s)]
*  Right. And so. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  And we would have arguments offline about Israel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=48.88s)]
*  And I remember distinctly telling him, like, look, I don't know if it's going to be 10 years, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=52.199999999999996s)]
*  maybe 15 years or 20 years, but there's going to be a problem because the Democratic Party [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=56.48s)]
*  for Israel, the Democratic Party is going to move away. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=62.92s)]
*  And when a Democrat gets in at one point, we're going to see them cut off aid to Israel [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=66.32s)]
*  because of the way in your support for Israel's behavior is the greatest threat to its existence. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=72.92s)]
*  This was my sort of a jujitsu argument at that time. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=80.88s)]
*  Obviously, Joe Biden, not that guy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=85.72s)]
*  Right. Ten years later. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  However, the Democratic Party, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  in terms of voters, has changed dramatically. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=95.72s)]
*  And what I found fascinating about this clip is that, A, we do not see this polling very often. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=100.28s)]
*  B. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=106.56s)]
*  It has real implications for Harris's loss that I think are not being reckoned with. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=107.52s)]
*  You know, and C, the fact that they introduced this as a Mamdani [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=116.64s)]
*  as a Mamdani phenomena is fascinating to me because they cannot deal with this head on. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=127.44s)]
*  I mean, the way they tiptoe around this, it's fascinating. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=134.2s)]
*  Here is Harry Antin and Kate Boldewan on CNN News. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=139.16s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo during the primary attack on Dany is being insufficiently pro-Israel. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm not quite sure the former governor understood how much the politics have changed around this issue among Democrats. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=150.72s)]
*  What are we talking about here? All right. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=157.2s)]
*  Who Democrats sympathize more with, Israelis or Palestinians? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=158.92s)]
*  In 2017, the Democratic Party was a pro-Israeli party. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=162.84s)]
*  Look at this. They sympathized with the Israelis by 13 points, more with the Israelis than the Palestinians. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=165.64s)]
*  But look at this. See change. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=170.12s)]
*  Now Democrats sympathize more with the Palestinians by 43 points. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=171.92s)]
*  Oh, my God, that is a change in the margin of 56 points over the course of just eight years. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=177.16s)]
*  So all of a sudden, it's the pro-Palestinian position that actually reigns supreme in democratic politics, not the Israeli position. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=184.12s)]
*  And that is part of the reason why Mondani was able to do so well in this primary, because those attacks over Israel simply put did not ring true for Democrats. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=191.32s)]
*  They're now on the side of the Palestinians, not the Israelis. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=199.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a much bigger issue specifically with Mondani, though. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=202.12s)]
*  I mean, an outspoken critic of Israel. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=207.0s)]
*  He's facing continued criticism, though, for not being outspoken enough against anti-Semitism. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=208.6s)]
*  That is for sure. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  Pause for a second. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=215.2s)]
*  But on this, what is it? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=216.04s)]
*  Excuse me, what? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=217.2s)]
*  What is it? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=217.72s)]
*  Like what? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=218.16s)]
*  Mondani has also said virtually nothing about, you know, how many flavors of ice cream we should have. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, there is, listen, there is undoubtedly and there has always been anti-Semitism. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  A portion of the Israeli critique has always been motivated by anti-Semitism. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=236.12s)]
*  But there is absolutely no reason to believe that Democrats have become 56 percent more anti-Semitic in the past eight years. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=243.56s)]
*  There's absolutely no reason to believe, frankly, that anti-Semitism has become a greater, has changed in its relative to the critique of Israel. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=267.12s)]
*  I mean, and I would even argue that there is not even like, you know, the the the, you know, so-called America first. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  Like, I don't think like I don't think that has changed at all. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=276.56s)]
*  The dynamic that's changed is that there is more accessible information to the general public as to over the past eight to ten years, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=279.68s)]
*  as to the actions of the Israeli government and to the plight of the Palestinian people, both an awareness of the Nakba, both an awareness of the founding of Israel. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=290.88s)]
*  All of these things have come to light more dramatically, but they've got to go around it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=303.68s)]
*  I think it's even more simple than that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=309.6s)]
*  People are inundated in the past two years with these videos of what Israel is doing to the people in Gaza. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=311.52s)]
*  I have seen more videos of mangled children than I could have ever imagined I would ever see. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  It really it really like destroys your your like mental health. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=328.92s)]
*  As you see this stuff, it will immediately turn you against whoever is perpetrating this stuff. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=334.12s)]
*  And then to see the whole, you know, sort of government apparatus, your own government siding with the people doing this to the children you're seeing in these videos. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=339.56s)]
*  And it outrages you more than you could imagine. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=351.24s)]
*  Like, like Sam said, there'll always be these far right fringes that go on to the Israel issue to basically like hide their anti-Semitism. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=354.36s)]
*  But they are now like such a small portion of the overall population because so many people are now anti the Israeli government and Netanyahu's government because of what they've seen. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=363.76000000000005s)]
*  And it's just that simple. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  Like, and yes, when you go down that line and you see these videos, there is a portion of that electorate who is going to dig a little bit further and find out about the Nakba and the history of the Israel and Palestine conflict. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=377.6s)]
*  But you don't need people to dig. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  No, people are just so in what's also these videos in terms of the analysis here, too, which fascinates me. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=394.08s)]
*  It is put in the sense that Cuomo's attacks were not effective against Mamdani. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=402.24s)]
*  But there was a massive election that took place. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  Ten months ago, eight months ago, nine months ago, where the Democratic candidate would not even allow a Palestinian speaker to speak at the DNC. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  And that is shocking. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  When you look at these numbers, which the Democratic, you know, the people running Harris's campaign now, maybe they have increased over the past eight months over the course. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=430.24s)]
*  You know, those are that's a change that's placed over eight years. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=441.36s)]
*  And maybe all of that increases happen. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=444.24s)]
*  All of that change that 56 percent swing changed in eight months. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=446.32s)]
*  But I don't think so. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=451.92s)]
*  I think I think you could see the trend. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=453.28s)]
*  And it was a just strictly on a political level, total malpractice by the Harris campaign. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=455.92s)]
*  We know just a few things to that point. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=468.24s)]
*  And I also just want to say I think the cultural circumstances for a shift in a position on Israel was also set, you know, just by the changing standards. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=469.68s)]
*  Like there's a lot less strong feelings of evangelical Christianity within our society. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, from just 20, 30 years ago, there was just a lot more of that, like diffusing to our society. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=484.0s)]
*  Oh, the Christian Zionists are there. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=488.56s)]
*  It's just that we have become polarized from them. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=490.04s)]
*  Then this is just Democrats. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=492.16s)]
*  No, I'm just saying, like, you know, even before there were a lot more Christian Zionism and Christian evangelicalism just diffused throughout our society before, you know, like 20, 30 years ago, a lot of people who are shifting these positions are just younger. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=494.08s)]
*  Not only are they just like not growing up in the same society that has like, you know, a lot of secularized Christian dogma in it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=506.79999999999995s)]
*  But this is all people who are growing up in the aftermath of a one failed war in the Middle East, like the Iraq war and the negative feelings surrounding their invasion of Iraq. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=514.72s)]
*  The negative feelings surrounding like being lied into that, I think, has colored how a lot of people view this current conflict in a way that like makes them more skeptical of those positions. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=523.6s)]
*  And for the Harris campaign. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=534.2s)]
*  OK, watch the rest of this clip where they try to attribute it to young people, but all Democrats, 56% swing and they try to attribute it to young people. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=535.96s)]
*  My guess is if you look on the Republican side, the support for Israel has gone up as it has become more of a Christian side. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=546.88s)]
*  Kufi is a bigger organization, at least in terms of membership by far than APAC. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=553.64s)]
*  But look at this. Watch this video. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  Anti-Semitism, that is for sure. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=562.5999999999999s)]
*  But on this, what is it? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=564.92s)]
*  Talk about Democrats and how broadly how this really is shifting. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=567.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know, you see this, you see this among Democrats overall, right? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=571.6s)]
*  But we know that Mondani's base was younger voters within the Democratic Party. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=574.68s)]
*  And so I want to break it down with younger Democrats. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=579.4s)]
*  Correct. So take a look here. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=581.52s)]
*  Who age 18 to 49 Democrats sympathize more with the Israelis or the Palestinians? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=583.72s)]
*  Again, in 2017, younger Democrats sympathize more with the Israelis by 14 points. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=587.8s)]
*  Look at this shift now. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=592.0s)]
*  Palestinians, they sympathize more with the Palestinians by 57 points. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=593.64s)]
*  That is an over 70 point shift in the margin in just a matter of eight years. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=597.7199999999999s)]
*  So the bottom line is Mondani's base within the Democratic Party and the base of the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=603.3599999999999s)]
*  Democratic Party of younger voters, younger Democrats have changed. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  Pause it for one second. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=611.76s)]
*  The idea of saying younger Democrats go to age 49. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=614.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, what? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=618.64s)]
*  Really? To be. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=621.0799999999999s)]
*  I do. When talking about elections, that is considered to be young voters. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=623.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=627.92s)]
*  30 to 50 is not considered a young voter. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=629.48s)]
*  It is a it is a slight of hand. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=634.32s)]
*  Let's put it this way. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=637.16s)]
*  If they could find that 70 point 70 point swing between 18 and 35, they would have shown it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=638.52s)]
*  That swing has taken place from 35 to 60 almost as well to 50 as well. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=645.88s)]
*  I mean, so the. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=652.0s)]
*  Understand what's going on here. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=655.88s)]
*  They are trying to make this as if it is not a broad based reaction by the Democrats. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=657.6s)]
*  There is no doubt in my mind that a 65 year old or a 70 year old or an 80 year old or an 85 year old [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=664.0s)]
*  Democrat. Have not moved off their vision of Israel from when, you know, Paul Newman [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=671.92s)]
*  played, you know, was in Exodus. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=678.68s)]
*  You know, but but because I know these people, but the fact of the matter is, you know, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=681.8s)]
*  we're talking about below 50. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=687.4s)]
*  We're not just talking about young people here. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  It's funny. Five years getting confused by Tick Tock. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=691.64s)]
*  Let me exactly. I mean, that's the implication, right? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=694.4799999999999s)]
*  That it's just like this is like Instagram, some type of like social media. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  I think I just appreciate still being considered a young voter. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=703.0799999999999s)]
*  So, yes, I have 30 more years. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=705.8399999999999s)]
*  I think that your point is the more like important one from this data, which is that probably only the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=709.88s)]
*  plus 65 people like those boomer age people who grew up in that media landscape where this was a lot less [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=714.28s)]
*  information, a lot more Christian Zionism just diffused like 700 Club is like on every channel or whatever. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=720.84s)]
*  Like they're the only ones in the Democratic Party who feel strongly pro-Israel and, you know, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=727.16s)]
*  everyone else is shifting. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=732.16s)]
*  Yep. Yep. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=733.64s)]
*  Let's just continue to play the play this club. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=735.48s)]
*  Years. So the bottom line is Mondani's base within the Democratic Party and the base of the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=738.44s)]
*  Democratic Party of younger voters, younger Democrats have changed tremendously on this issue in [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=743.8000000000001s)]
*  eight years. I rarely ever see shifts like this, Kate, in which you see one side of the equation [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=749.7600000000001s)]
*  leading by 14 points eight years ago and then all of a sudden the other side of the equation [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=754.5200000000001s)]
*  leading by 57 points. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=758.6s)]
*  The bottom line is the politics around the Israelis and the Palestinians have shifted [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=760.08s)]
*  tremendously among Democrats and they shifted specifically tremendously among Democrats who are [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=764.8000000000001s)]
*  under the age of 50 younger Democrats from Mondani's base and also the base of Democratic [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=769.72s)]
*  socialists like himself, like Bernie Sanders, like AOC. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=774.64s)]
*  They have just shifted more so than I think that anyone could possibly have imagined, say, eight [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=777.88s)]
*  years ago. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=782.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, again, the idea that they're not bringing this up in the context of the 2024 election [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=785.36s)]
*  is pretty stunning. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=791.12s)]
*  We got the under 90 voters like Bernie Sanders pulling that number down. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=793.48s)]
*  And like you say, Sam, it's been a regular point of conversation that this is not sustainable [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=798.96s)]
*  given the Democratic Party's base. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=803.8000000000001s)]
*  It's actually pretty imaginable. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=806.4s)]
*  You imagined it to indeed, Mike. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=808.16s)]
*  Yep. I mean, it was quite clear what was going on when you have Tim Kaine, you know, boycotting [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=810.2s)]
*  Netanyahu's talk in the Senate, then you know there's something afoot. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRpfkyAWf5s&t=815.92s)]
