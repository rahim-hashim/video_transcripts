# Israel's Right-Wing Angered By Trump's Gaza Ceasefire Plan
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws)
*  Let's talk about this this this Israeli ceasefire deal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=0.0s)]
*  It is quite clear that Joe Biden did not have a situation where he couldn't [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=3.84s)]
*  influence [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=10.0s)]
*  the Israelis to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=11.0s)]
*  Push them to a ceasefire [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=14.84s)]
*  It is quite clear that Joe Biden never [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=17.12s)]
*  exercised any of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=20.88s)]
*  The tools at his disposal [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  to influence the Israelis [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=26.12s)]
*  The Leahy law [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  other laws [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  US laws on the books that says based upon Israeli actions [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=32.24s)]
*  We could stop funding that you know, they're providing them offensive weapons or any type of weapons [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=36.72s)]
*  Or just unilaterally deciding to do that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=42.32s)]
*  We had State Department officials quit over the fact that it was clear the State Department was ignoring a specialist on this like the evidence [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=46.24s)]
*  Is impossible to ignore that? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  Joe Biden [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=58.16s)]
*  You want to argue that well, even if he had done those things the Israelis would have kept going [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  That's a theoretical argument. The one reality we know is that Joe Biden did never pressed and used [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  His resources in the way that Reagan had let's say [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=71.4s)]
*  With Menachem Begin, etc, etc [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  We also know that Kamala Harris did not publicly break with Joe Biden [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=80.24s)]
*  It I [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=87.04s)]
*  Speculated during the run-up to the election based upon who is her foreign policy advisors were as opposed to McGurk and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=89.04s)]
*  Hoxdean who are I? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=95.96s)]
*  Mean, I think Hoxie is literally an Israeli [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=98.36s)]
*  IDF yeah or [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=101.96s)]
*  That her top national security advisor Phil Gordon [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=104.92s)]
*  Who had been Obama's and worked on the Iran nuclear deal? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=109.6s)]
*  Was going to signal a change of policy we don't know [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=114.32s)]
*  We also said during the election [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=119.8s)]
*  That when Miriam Adelson sometime, I think it was over the course of the summer put out [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=122.32s)]
*  He's her a demand to give Donald Trump over a hundred million dollars [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  She personally gave him a hundred million dollars for his campaign and then had a network that provided [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  Tens of millions of dollars more did a fundraiser for just Israel at his golf course [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  In Bedminster around the summer which was by the way around the time that Netanyahu [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  Did his little jaunt down to Mar-a-Lago and there was a conversation [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=147.88s)]
*  Multiple seemingly probably conversations between Donald Trump and Netanyahu, which I think are relevant with the timing of this news [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  Oh, absolutely, and we heard her say like last time [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  You know Sheldon and I are late husband. We asked for Donald Trump. We said we want the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=162.0s)]
*  We said we want the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=166.68s)]
*  We want the embassy in Jerusalem and he gave it to us and that is a bonus we never even asked [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=170.68s)]
*  He gave us the Golan Heights exactly and I and she uses we I think she's also an Israeli citizen as well [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=176.0s)]
*  American and Israeli citizen and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  So we speculated at a time as Donald Trump is saying like the day that I get into office [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=185.6s)]
*  Hamas will ceasefire and of course everyone who follows this with any modicum of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  Objectivity knows that the reason why a deal has not been struck for any ceasefire [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  During the course of this is because Israel has refused to do it. They have moved the the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=201.56s)]
*  goalposts multiple times Biden tried to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  hem [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  Netanyahu in by announcing this at one point that it was the Israeli proposal and then Netanyahu turned around said like well [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  We rejected bank of year was bragging today about how many ceasefire [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=217.5s)]
*  Agreements they blocked while the entire time the administration [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=221.8s)]
*  Publicly was saying that there was Hamas that was the obstacle [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=225.26s)]
*  So they were lying to to not use a cutoff arms at all [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=227.78s)]
*  But still hoping a ceasefire would happen but not doing any of the steps to actually get a ceasefire [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=233.54s)]
*  Ben Gavir is saying that they're still going to try to fight this one and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=238.9s)]
*  Looks like if Trump's going to be the one to say no, we're actually gonna push this through [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=242.66s)]
*  It doesn't look good for Biden. Well, it doesn't look good for Biden [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't look good for Biden period because I think like you start with the baseline [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=249.1s)]
*  I think it's like [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=253.16s)]
*  Incontrovertible that Biden never [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=256.12s)]
*  exercised [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=258.88s)]
*  The tools that were at his disposal to end this I don't think he wanted to dictate whether it be ended period and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=260.44s)]
*  Donald Trump I think is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=269.2s)]
*  He wants the ceasefire there and I think the deal is [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=271.68s)]
*  You're this is how you're going to get the West Bank [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=275.96s)]
*  We're going to annex the West Bank now [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=279.44s)]
*  And then you're going to wait out to you know [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=281.44s)]
*  And I offer this without an assessment as to whether it's worth it. It's certainly [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=284.88s)]
*  For the slaughter that's going on. You want to stop the slaughter is the first thing that you want to do [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=290.4s)]
*  in my estimation [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=295.92s)]
*  but [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=298.12s)]
*  make I [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=299.4s)]
*  Think a lot of this that we're hearing from the Netanyahu government [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=301.0s)]
*  That their hands are tied with the Trump is exactly what they would have said if Biden had exercised any of this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=306.04s)]
*  but they're also this is part of the KFAB in my estimation, but here is a [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=312.44000000000005s)]
*  Scroll up just so that we can [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=318.56s)]
*  Netanyahu's chief proponent on channel 14 [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  Errol Siegel and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=325.44000000000005s)]
*  Here we go. This is and I'm gonna read the subtitles [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=327.72s)]
*  When Trump was elected [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=331.8s)]
*  What was I doing here? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=334.16s)]
*  I was wrong in thinking that the first to pay the price for his election would be the Ukrainians [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=335.68s)]
*  It might be that we are the first to pay [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=342.56s)]
*  the price for Trump's election [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=346.64s)]
*  Because in this deal, I don't want to say [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  We're trying to get into it [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=355.04s)]
*  We're trying to get into it I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=357.68s)]
*  Wouldn't meddle in it and I don't know all the details [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=361.48s)]
*  So I'll be more cautious, etc. But I don't think this is what we [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=366.24s)]
*  Planned and what we expected [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=373.04s)]
*  We thought we were talking about other things. We thought we would take control of the northern strip [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  That's of Gaza. They would allow us to prevent aid [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=383.56s)]
*  from entering these areas [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=387.56s)]
*  This thus we would impose pressure on Hamas. What is happening and we need to tell the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  Truth to the viewers if a million Gazans return to the northern strip [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  The IDF will not return to fight in the northern strip [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=402.12s)]
*  We won't redo this whole event and a million remove a million people from there. It's not gonna happen [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=406.64000000000004s)]
*  He's lamenting we need to tell the truth [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  It might be that they will remain [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=416.68s)]
*  in [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=419.52s)]
*  parts in the Philadelphia perimeter [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=421.2s)]
*  Etc, but a million people returning to the northern strip ends the story and another thing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=424.08s)]
*  So we slowed that down a bit so we could read the captions [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=431.96s)]
*  But the bottom line is you're starting to hear [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=434.62s)]
*  Israelis complain and attribute this to Trump how rats reported that Trump's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=437.2s)]
*  Would be or soon to be ambassador to Israel got very rough with Netanyahu [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=443.48s)]
*  They said we can't talk to you right now. It's Shabbat because I don't care about Shabbat [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=449.0s)]
*  and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=453.8s)]
*  Mike Huckabee. No [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=455.32000000000005s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, he's the envoy [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  Literally envoy [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=464.8s)]
*  This Jew [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=467.92s)]
*  Who doesn't care about Shabbat doesn't recognize Shabbat in Israel, okay [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=469.52s)]
*  And I don't care about Shabbat. You better do this or Donald Trump's gonna be mad and that's the story that we're getting and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=474.0s)]
*  There is no doubt my mind that Donald Trump wanted this win. It is a win for him [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=481.12s)]
*  and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=488.84s)]
*  at the very least in the short term it is a win for [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=490.0s)]
*  Gazans if [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=494.6s)]
*  Israel is not able to stop aid and to stop and is forced to stop bombing without a doubt, but [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=496.0s)]
*  A I [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=504.24s)]
*  Think we don't need more proof that Joe Biden was not interested in in keeping the Israelis from stopping and B [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=505.92s)]
*  I suspect that Joe Biden was not going to sign off on the annexation of the West Bank [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=513.52s)]
*  Other people can make an assessment as to whether that's a trade that's worth making [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=519.8000000000001s)]
*  But I think within a year of Donald Trump being president. I don't know we could look back on when the Jerusalem [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=524.28s)]
*  Move what happened? I think that happened in the first 16 months of his [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=530.28s)]
*  Presidency last time we looked that up [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=534.84s)]
*  I suspect we're gonna see [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=537.08s)]
*  Israel annex the West Bank [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=540.44s)]
*  and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=543.16s)]
*  The US signing off on it [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=544.92s)]
*  The reality is is just that I pray that this is real and that there's some some relief for people in Gaza who've been [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=547.32s)]
*  Experiencing a genocide and whose lives will be forever ruined by the trauma that they've seen if if they do survive [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=554.88s)]
*  I hope that Donald Trump and the the Israeli government allow [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=562.04s)]
*  Independent journalists to go in and verify the true death tolls because we know that it's been undercounted by at minimum [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=567.76s)]
*  41% of the figures that we have but it's likely higher than that based on the study published in the Lancet that came out last week [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=573.96s)]
*  but I [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=580.56s)]
*  Also think we need to start talking about Biden's mental capacity and has it as it relates to this like, you know at the very least [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=582.4s)]
*  He should have understood that he was getting humiliated [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=589.76s)]
*  like he lived through a [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=592.52s)]
*  Nixon conspiring [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=595.2s)]
*  To undercut talks that LBJ was having during Vietnam. He lived he was a senator [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=597.28s)]
*  during the Iran hostage crisis where [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=603.88s)]
*  Carter [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=607.64s)]
*  Carter's hostage negotiations were sabotaged by a back deal with Reagan during an election year [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=608.72s)]
*  Reagan won and then on the day of his inauguration [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=614.04s)]
*  The hostages were released and that was like a similar 400 plus days around very similar timetable to this [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=617.28s)]
*  I feel like it was like 535. I remember when the headlines at 444 [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=624.4s)]
*  I saw last night on I went to the New York Times archive to look this up and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=629.08s)]
*  This is this [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=633.92s)]
*  Met Trump met with Netanyahu in July. We have the photos the ceasefire was allegedly reached [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=635.36s)]
*  10, you know a week before Trump's inauguration [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=642.76s)]
*  which was as predictable as possible and at the end of the day like I don't want people to take this as if this is [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=645.42s)]
*  like a [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=650.6s)]
*  An excuse for for Biden or for Harris or whatever [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=653.04s)]
*  No, it's it's an indictment on the fact that even it like they should have known that this was the political reality [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=656.14s)]
*  Just for their own ass just for their own like [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=661.56s)]
*  self-interest [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=665.72s)]
*  Specifically Biden and that's where we go back to some of the reporting about it's just Hoxine and McGurk and Sullivan [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=667.12s)]
*  Running this damn show because it's like West exec [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=675.76s)]
*  Dad's taking a they've gone to the Bahamas for like a month and a half [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=678.6s)]
*  We own the house feels rudderless because it probably is and run by [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=682.88s)]
*  Zionists and national security like establishment to use that word [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=687.76s)]
*  stalwarts who wanted to push through their agenda because this is like the think tank [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=693.8399999999999s)]
*  Environment here in the United States, it's it's very Zionist [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=699.88s)]
*  You mentioned Jimmy Carter Jimmy Carter didn't want to hear more about what happened to cost him that election [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=702.7199999999999s)]
*  And this is a broader problem with Democrats and the whole thing about them appearing weak and people thinking well [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=708.52s)]
*  Look at all this war stuff going on. Let's get a strong man in it [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=713.4000000000001s)]
*  They just confirmed that stuff and all this and there might be like, you know disclosures and reporting that comes out later that [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=716.6800000000001s)]
*  mitigates it and you know [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=723.6800000000001s)]
*  Israel's actions like in the West Bank [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=725.44s)]
*  But my problem is I don't have confidence that if Harris would have won [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=727.0s)]
*  She would have been able to put brakes on them [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=731.36s)]
*  Like I think that the West Bank might have been annexed under the first woman president if she had won and so like what's the difference? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=733.6s)]
*  the difference is a ceasefire was [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=740.2s)]
*  Secured before he was inaugurated and I don't know that that would have happened [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=742.84s)]
*  It had Harris won and that is catastrophic and which is not even mentioned the other thing that guy mentioned which is Ukraine [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=746.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's also a Trump is saying we need to get and start [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=752.72s)]
*  Enlisting 18 year olds or what not enlisting forcing to fight [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=757.6s)]
*  But like the Dems have abandoned and it goes to the top of the show the USS George W Bush and stuff like [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=760.7800000000001s)]
*  This is they've they've they've they've tried to win the military party thing and I think it's gonna be a pyrrhic no [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=767.12s)]
*  It's been a disaster. Yeah, and and and we were saying this to representative Jay Paul [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=773.0s)]
*  I came into politics animated about voting for Obama and the Democrats because I hated the Iraq War so much [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=778.48s)]
*  like what does this what has Biden done in terms of like not just [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=784.92s)]
*  Destroying the liberal international order like we're seeing liberalism kind of falling apart before our very eyes [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=791.04s)]
*  Claudia Scheinbaum down in Mexico is an 80% approval rating and is bragging about how like we begin by uplifting the poor and then you [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=795.96s)]
*  Have the Democrats collapsing and Trudeau having to resign up north [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=802.32s)]
*  You know, this is a failure of of of this kind of political philosophy and I'm hoping that in the end [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=806.76s)]
*  There's some there's some changes made but I don't know [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=814.4s)]
*  All right, do we have time for [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we get time for oh and can I say one more thing about this [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=822.4799999999999s)]
*  For all of Trump's faults and there are it is endless. He's a psycho and one of the most selfish people ever to be born [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=826.1999999999999s)]
*  he's at least a transactional politician and [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=834.68s)]
*  To Matt's point about like validating the strongman thing [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=837.68s)]
*  he want he cares about the PR of of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=840.92s)]
*  The the the dead kids right just like get it [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=844.8399999999999s)]
*  That's what he was saying at the time just get it done and get it over with like at the very least [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=847.7199999999999s)]
*  He has he shows a level of responsiveness [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=851.36s)]
*  that I think [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=853.88s)]
*  We should we shouldn't dismiss because again the Biden administration didn't listen to the [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=856.44s)]
*  Overwhelming calls to get him to step aside for a new nominee, which did not demonstrate democratic responsiveness [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=863.48s)]
*  And again, this is before Harris [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=869.2s)]
*  I mean to have a real primary and he also [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  Despite his base screaming at him and the rest of the country saying what is this? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=873.8000000000001s)]
*  Like why are we funding this genocide? He didn't show responsiveness on that either. So like there is a level of just like [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=878.16s)]
*  The calcification within the Democratic Party is really harming the the the the good and undercutting the good things [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=886.9599999999999s)]
*  That the Biden administration did and is leading us towards a fascist presidency and Donald Trump [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=894.28s)]
*  Potentially, I mean since we're piling on to [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=900.76s)]
*  you know, it is [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=904.52s)]
*  astonishing to me that the only time we ever hear from Barack Obama and he [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=906.36s)]
*  Exercises any type of like political power it seems to be to basically [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=911.72s)]
*  Stop the left from ascending like yeah [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=917.5600000000001s)]
*  Though Obama seems to me to have been the person who could have gotten Biden to step aside. Yep [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=924.48s)]
*  I [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=932.12s)]
*  Get it it's it's time-consuming you got to go you got a pitch [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=934.84s)]
*  You got to go like you got your Netflix deal and you got a pitch and you got to meet with producers and I've been there [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=939.88s)]
*  Yeah, I've been there. It's exhausting [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=946.32s)]
*  Then the idea of stepping in and saving the country [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=948.64s)]
*  from [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=953.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, yeah [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=954.2s)]
*  But I do appreciate the fact that he could be you know [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=956.2800000000001s)]
*  He's not gonna let that get in the way of perhaps, you know [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=960.4s)]
*  Maybe having some type of marginal impact on Donald Trump in the White House [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=963.72s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing that really really drives me crazy is the absolute hubris and arrogance [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=967.96s)]
*  Yep, that Obama displays in terms of his ability to personally [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=974.92s)]
*  Sort of like change things. I just I just remember in the run-up to the 2010 elections where he just basically went into a [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=980.64s)]
*  Into a caucus meeting with the Democrats in the house and the Senate and like I [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=988.14s)]
*  Got this and it turned out he did not got this [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=995.42s)]
*  He maintained his position. We lost a thousand Democratic [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1000.34s)]
*  Office holders across the country. That's why we had this sort of dearth for years of like wait [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1005.14s)]
*  Where are all the where's our bench in this? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1009.66s)]
*  Why why is the guy mayor from Indianapolis like an actual choice in this election? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1013.0s)]
*  Because there was no there was no other state officials [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1019.72s)]
*  Do we even have any governors that ran that year? Yeah in 2020. Do we even have any governors? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1022.96s)]
*  like no, well, like why is that is because in 2010 and in 2012 and in [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1029.48s)]
*  2014 and in 2016 [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1037.52s)]
*  The [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1040.96s)]
*  Obama administration had so undermined any outside organizing and had so [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1042.96s)]
*  Refused to provide any sort of like use any of their political cache to create an environment [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1051.08s)]
*  for Democrats that like [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1057.88s)]
*  Secretary of State in 2010 loses, you know some Democrat and like half a dozen states that state senators lose [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1060.48s)]
*  They can't go on to become governor and and that's basically it. So [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1067.88s)]
*  Yep, and [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1073.2800000000002s)]
*  That's ideological for Obama, you know, it's part of why he he was okay with that city group list for his cabinet officials [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1074.72s)]
*  He genuinely I think believes in like individual [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1081.16s)]
*  Need to capitalize bankers and you folks it'd be nice if we could help you but it's just not efficient [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1085.8000000000002s)]
*  He's like a believer in bootstraps and like and and his own kind of individual power. He's not a collectivist politician [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOsh5-L33Ws&t=1090.8400000000001s)]
