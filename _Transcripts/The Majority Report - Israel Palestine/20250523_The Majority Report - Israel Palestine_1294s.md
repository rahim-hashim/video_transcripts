# CNN Pushes Narrative That "Free Palestine" Is Antisemitic
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE)
*  Dana bash did she ever work for a pack? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's hard to figure out over a CNN who actually because I know that wolf blitzer did yes [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  I think I'd accidentally mix that up before I don't think Jay Tapper did although. It's unclear that he's not now [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=9.44s)]
*  Dana bash I don't I don't know [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=19.16s)]
*  But this is just absolutely back runs ads on CNN. It's just absolutely stunning [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=21.76s)]
*  They've literally killed thousands upon thousands of children [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=27.84s)]
*  I saw a statistic that was released by the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  Ministry of Health in in Gaza the number of children under the age of like 12 or 13 who have been killed and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=35.44s)]
*  It's in the thousands. It's all they can verify. It's all they can verify and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=42.88s)]
*  one of the horrible statistics about it is that apparently [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=48.56s)]
*  The age cohort of children who [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=52.2s)]
*  Who have died the most are in like the six to like [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=57.72s)]
*  Nine range [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=64.6s)]
*  because [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=66.6s)]
*  They're too big to be carried [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  by their parents and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  Too young to run fast enough to run fast enough [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=73.64s)]
*  Too young to run fast enough to avoid being killed [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=78.4s)]
*  This is like what is going on there [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=88.68s)]
*  Channel 13 news poll in Israel should Israel let a humanitarian aid go to Gaza [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=93.2s)]
*  53% said no [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=100.84s)]
*  34% said yes 13% said we don't know [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=104.68s)]
*  Transferring transferring it which is ethnic cleansing, right? Yeah [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=109.4s)]
*  56% [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  This is a Penn this is Penn State University poll that those reported on [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  80 excuse me 82% support for ethnically cleansing of Gazans [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  56% of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=132.16s)]
*  To ethnically cleanse Israeli Arabs [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=135.24s)]
*  47% support killing all Gazans I [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=139.32s)]
*  Mean it's a deeply brainwashed sick society and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  But here is Dana bash on CNN [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=154.76s)]
*  With her perspective on what constitutes violence [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  You just heard the alleged killer saying free Palestine [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  We hear that on the streets. We hear that on college campuses and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=168.56s)]
*  There are a lot of people who feel who have been worried that that has been [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=172.96s)]
*  Turned into a call to arms and a call to action and violence. Yes [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  Others claim that it's not what do you think now that we have seen this? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=183.32000000000002s)]
*  I think there's no question whatever its initial intent and whatever people were saying is [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=187.52s)]
*  And whatever people were saying initially or meant it it has become a call for violence and not violence [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=192.04s)]
*  Against Israelis, which is wrong [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=198.04s)]
*  but violence against Jews and anybody who tries to separate the two and try to say [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=200.04s)]
*  Oh, I'm just against palace. I'm just you know against Israel's policies in Palestine or [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=206.6s)]
*  genocide [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=212.44s)]
*  And I'm not anti-semitic. This is this is it. This was anti-semitism pure and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=213.88s)]
*  Simple that he happened to have killed two Israeli staff members didn't matter. It was a Jewish event. They were targets [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=220.28s)]
*  Positive listen, we don't know enough. I mean, here's the thing. We know what the manifesto says now. Listen, I [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=227.64s)]
*  Don't want to make it clear. Obviously this goes without saying except for in this environment [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  I [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  Don't support or condone [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=240.6s)]
*  Murder or killing absolutely I didn't support when Israel struck [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=243.84s)]
*  An embassy in Iran. I don't support can we show our face by the killing? Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I don't support the killing of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=249.22s)]
*  of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=258.1s)]
*  Diplomatic work people. I don't support the the killing of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=259.54s)]
*  Non-diplomatic people. I don't support any of this. It was murder. It was all it is unclear [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=264.18s)]
*  You know the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=271.86s)]
*  even in this guy's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=273.26s)]
*  Logic as presented by his alleged manifesto there is no [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  Rational basis for him to do this type of killing but there the word Jew does not show up in his manifesto [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=282.58000000000004s)]
*  Actually, Robert McNamara makes more of an appearance in his manifesto than any [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=290.7s)]
*  Jew does [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=296.06s)]
*  The idea again of conflating this [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=298.26s)]
*  With [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=301.73999999999995s)]
*  And we don't know how this guy chose these two people. We don't know [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=303.14s)]
*  Whether he was falling. We just don't know this information and she doesn't know this either [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=308.61999999999995s)]
*  And so to go on and claim that this is an anti-semitic attack [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=314.82s)]
*  simply because it was out in front of a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=320.46s)]
*  Jewish program [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=326.7s)]
*  And [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=329.46s)]
*  to claim that he just [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=331.06s)]
*  coincidentally killed Israelis [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=333.5s)]
*  or Israeli government officials is just the the height of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=336.38s)]
*  Irresponsibility, it's very clearly political murder and not religious murders. I mean [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  all indications at this point are that it was a [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=349.58s)]
*  Political but we really don't know all the information we have is an alleged manifesto and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=353.38s)]
*  Knowing that the two victims. I think I don't know that even the the the guy [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=359.62s)]
*  Perceived himself as Jewish [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=367.5s)]
*  But even if you want to say that the motivation say the motivations were explicitly anti-semitic and not about Israel's actions [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=371.94s)]
*  This still does not but this the conflation is still the problem [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=379.54s)]
*  That's it's still the problem where you're saying if it if it is a political killing [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=383.74s)]
*  They're still conflating the political ideology of Zionism with Judaism, which is so dangerous for Jews [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=388.62s)]
*  It is just I mean it let alone dangerous for Palestinians [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=395.9s)]
*  Because the more that this kind of effort to suppress [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=400.9s)]
*  Dissent against this genocide goes on the more time we lose the more children get blown apart the more children starve to death [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=404.38s)]
*  We have people talk about bringing the temperature down as if the protesters are supposed to do that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=411.74s)]
*  No, American government needs to stop sending bombs [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=416.38s)]
*  That's the only way to stop this to take this temperature down and this woman. I mean, yes, this is what I mean [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=419.02s)]
*  I want to make sure that we run that this was the right person Isaac Chotner [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=424.3s)]
*  Of the New Yorker who? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=430.46s)]
*  It's amazing. He gets people to agree to talk to him because he's always like getting them to say embarrassing things [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  She used to work for the Biden administration [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=438.46s)]
*  She was the special envoy for anti-semitism [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=440.94s)]
*  And she said things like this is her she defended in this interview the Trump administration's actions [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=443.97999999999996s)]
*  going after student protesters in this [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=451.21999999999997s)]
*  and also [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=456.21999999999997s)]
*  Chotner asked what do you think the Trump administration is doing to fight anti-semitism and in that sense uphold democracy? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=457.5s)]
*  She says it's calling universities to account [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=462.65999999999997s)]
*  She said she was pleased [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=466.78s)]
*  By that because they're asking the University Columbia to live up to its own standards people should read that Chotner exactly interview it is [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=469.06s)]
*  he just [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=477.21999999999997s)]
*  Completely [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=480.18s)]
*  Exposes her for the ridiculousness it is and here she is [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=482.58s)]
*  Praising the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=489.53999999999996s)]
*  The completely illicit attack in Lebanon upon which ended up maiming and killing [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=493.14s)]
*  children and innocence and whatnot [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=500.41999999999996s)]
*  And just laughs it off as if it's it's a joke with the beeper. This is back in 2024 [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=502.94s)]
*  after October 7th, there was a feeling around the world that Israel is weaker and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=509.86s)]
*  In in in the you want a beeper [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=517.1s)]
*  It we [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=519.22s)]
*  There you go [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=521.98s)]
*  So let's take lessons on this person about hate [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=523.3000000000001s)]
*  Free Palestine is a call for violence is what Dana bash is saying right there on television [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=525.98s)]
*  She's saying some people say that some people say that I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure Dana bash [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=531.98s)]
*  And here's the one guest I have who happens to agree with that sentiment [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=537.6600000000001s)]
*  There's a massive fraud about anti-semitism being conducted by people like Dana bash [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=541.46s)]
*  She's the one who said Rashida to leave but was being anti-semitic for criticizing Dana Nestle for it with all the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=545.82s)]
*  Suppression of speech which incidentally came out [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=552.5s)]
*  That that was the case she dropped charges. Yep, Nestle had to because of how ridiculous [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=555.58s)]
*  her targeting of these students was and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=561.34s)]
*  It just the to say this in this environment as a reporter when the Trump administration is [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=564.9000000000001s)]
*  Rounding up people for their speech and for you to say now [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv6iZt5PeE&t=570.82s)]
