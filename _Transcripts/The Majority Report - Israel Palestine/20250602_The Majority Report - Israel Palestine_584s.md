# Biden Ghoul Finally Admits Israel Committed War Crimes
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs)
*  Matthew Miller, this guy, people may remember this guy is the vampiric like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=0.0s)]
*  State Department smirking guy from the Biden administration, who [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=5.48s)]
*  spent the last year and a half of his job there, denying genocide repeatedly. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=11.28s)]
*  Smugly over and over again to reporters asking legitimate questions. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=18.42s)]
*  To be clear, there is. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=22.72s)]
*  The stuff that Israel has been doing in Gaza for the past year and a half, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=26.56s)]
*  fundamentally not any different than what they're doing now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=32.56s)]
*  I mean, it is the case that they're not killing food aid workers because [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=38.56s)]
*  they're in charge of it now and they've hired. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=46.56s)]
*  But US mercenaries, fundamentally, same exact dynamic. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=49.96s)]
*  But there's an opportunity here now for a lot of people to do some CYA and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=55.96s)]
*  some retconning of their reputation. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=62.96s)]
*  The moment this guy should have salvaged his reputation was well over a year and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  a half ago when he should have resigned from the administration in protest. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=75.56s)]
*  Like other people in the State Department did, many of his colleagues. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=79.36s)]
*  He didn't follow suit because he had a job where he was in prominence. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=82.76s)]
*  He was the State Department spokesperson and it's important. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=86.16s)]
*  You know, you can weigh like genocide on one end and furthering your career on [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=90.56s)]
*  the other. And this is an extension of that ladder thing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=95.86s)]
*  And understand the relationship between. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=99.86s)]
*  Those who were denying what was going on in Israel and those who have used [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=105.56s)]
*  protest about what's going on in Israel as a weapon that ended up. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=114.16s)]
*  Allowing for the images we just saw of immigration, you know, deputies [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  essentially going around in full riot gear like the relationship between the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=128.76s)]
*  arrests and the doxing and the harassing and the disappearing of students who [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=134.46s)]
*  protested against the genocide that's taking place in Israel is just a flavor [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=141.66s)]
*  and an extension. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=149.36s)]
*  It is on the same continuum as what we're seeing with them arresting, you know, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=150.36s)]
*  moms and kids under these with these immigration under the auspices of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=154.46s)]
*  detaining immigrants. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=161.96s)]
*  But here he is. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=163.46s)]
*  I go back a little bit. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=168.36s)]
*  I want to hear the question. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=170.06s)]
*  Do you think what's going on in Gaza now is a genocide? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=171.36s)]
*  I don't I don't think it's a genocide, but I think the I think it is without a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=174.66s)]
*  doubt true that Israel has committed war crimes. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=181.16s)]
*  You wouldn't have said that the podium. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=184.16s)]
*  Yeah, look at because I am when you're at the podium, you're not expressing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=185.46s)]
*  your personal opinion. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=187.86s)]
*  You're expressing the conclusions of the United States government that conclude [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=188.66s)]
*  the United States government has had not concluded they committed war crimes [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=191.36s)]
*  still have not concluded that but your personal view is they have also and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=195.06s)]
*  they were while you were there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=199.46s)]
*  But here's here. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=200.56s)]
*  Yes, but here let me let me qualify that there are two ways to think about the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=201.56s)]
*  Commission of War Crimes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  One is if the state has pursued a policy to deliberately committing war crimes [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  or is acting reckless in a way that aids and abets war crimes and that I think [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=212.06s)]
*  is an open question. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=215.66000000000003s)]
*  I think what is hard is almost certainly not an open question is that there have [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=217.26000000000002s)]
*  been individual incidents that have been that have been war crimes where members [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  of the Israeli military have committed war crimes. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=225.86s)]
*  So ultimately in almost every major conflict including conflicts prosecuted [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=227.86s)]
*  by democracies, you will see individual members of the military of militaries [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=233.56s)]
*  commit war crimes and the way you judge a democracy is whether they hold those [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=238.46s)]
*  people accountable that Israel has and that's my point is we have. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=242.46s)]
*  Not yet seen them hold sufficient number of the military. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=246.96s)]
*  Okay, so they haven't held any of their military accountable, but that's not [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=250.16s)]
*  indicative to Miller two years into this that this is a government policy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=256.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean the complete lack of hell holding these people to account is should be [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=264.66s)]
*  essentially all you need to know about whether it's government policy just even [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  assuming like you didn't know anything else about what's going on there, but I'm [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=277.56s)]
*  sorry. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  I get that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=283.56s)]
*  It's your job. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=284.06s)]
*  But you're a scumbag. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=286.26s)]
*  You know, it's like it's one thing. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=289.16s)]
*  It's like, you know what? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=290.56s)]
*  I know we didn't do the best job in rolling out this legislation or I'm going [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=293.36s)]
*  Talk about the positives of the Affordable Care Act website, even though I know it's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=298.76000000000005s)]
*  sort of a cluster F because it's my job. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=304.06s)]
*  But is there really nothing? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, that's the next question. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  I want to hear what would it take for you to resign and protest? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=312.46000000000004s)]
*  What could what could you be forced to lie about that? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=318.56s)]
*  It would cause you to resign and protest. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  That's the real question. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=326.26s)]
*  Every single one of those people at the State Department who quit every one of the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=329.46s)]
*  people who quit within the context of the US government as a protest not nearly [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=335.06s)]
*  as much enough, but they all quit because of the level of of horror that was going [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=340.06s)]
*  on. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=350.65999999999997s)]
*  It wasn't just like I'm having to associate myself with the with the government [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=350.86s)]
*  is doing some stuff that I don't like and nobody nobody in the administration, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=355.16s)]
*  at least the public facing part had to do more to sell a lie than this guy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=363.66s)]
*  And he was in the State Department where we know we talked to an L. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=372.06s)]
*  Sheeline about this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=376.06s)]
*  There were dissent cables. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=377.16s)]
*  There were people blowing the whistle internally. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=379.26000000000005s)]
*  Some of them who resigned some of them who didn't and so he knew of course he knew [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=382.36s)]
*  but now he can concede war crimes what because he's out of the administration [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=389.06s)]
*  five six months because now it's less of an implicate. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=393.86s)]
*  It's less he feels implicated on it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=396.76s)]
*  And now he now now that's the line war crimes not genocide because the genocide it [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=399.46s)]
*  was clear what Israel was going to do on October 8th and we've seen them execute [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=404.36s)]
*  that slaughter to the the heights that they're unabated. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=410.26000000000005s)]
*  I thought at one point they would have to be stopped but turns out no and a good part [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=415.46000000000004s)]
*  of that is his complicity in that in selling to the American public. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  Why Hinrich wasn't he the one who was saying to reporters about like the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  hin hin Rajab's cries before she was assassinated by Israel like that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=428.16s)]
*  Oh, we're looking into it or the Israelis should conduct their own investigation. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=433.66s)]
*  We're looking into it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=437.66s)]
*  He I think for months denied continuously said that they were continuing to do a [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=438.76s)]
*  report or investigation into it lying about the death of this young little girl over [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=446.26s)]
*  and over again and the next question we don't even need to play it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=450.85999999999996s)]
*  But is this Sky News reporter asking him like how did this affect your family having [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=453.96s)]
*  all these protesters outside your house? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=458.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=460.76s)]
*  At least they're not slaughtered in his whole family isn't completely obliterated [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=461.76s)]
*  like we've seen. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=466.06s)]
*  Yeah, the see how it's on him and his family. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=466.86s)]
*  Gaza, it's important for students. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=469.15999999999997s)]
*  This this whole Matt Miller thing should be taught to any student of American [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=471.76s)]
*  government, which is that which is about our government's relationship to the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=476.65999999999997s)]
*  truth and that is one that's provisional and opportunistic and you know, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=479.86s)]
*  if we don't need to lie for Israel, his duties made him eight and a bet war crimes [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=484.46s)]
*  by his own admission and the way he says, well, I don't know if you know even [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=489.06s)]
*  the thing he says about war crimes. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=494.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, could you spend some bad eggs? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=495.56s)]
*  We don't have anything. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  It's like what Holocaust deniers say is where's Hitler's signature on the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=498.86s)]
*  Holocaust policy because without that then I don't know that the high command [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=503.26s)]
*  really wanted it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=508.56s)]
*  We know that BB not in Yahoo and Ben Gavir and none of these people give a shit [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=509.36s)]
*  about what's happening to Palestinians. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=513.46s)]
*  Please. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGALNE-q3gs&t=515.0600000000001s)]
