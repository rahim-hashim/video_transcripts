# SCHUMER AND JEFFRIES MUST GO
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI)
*  Look at this poll. Here's Mano Raju and I don't know what the name of the guy is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=0.0s)]
*  David Chalyan. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=4.12s)]
*  David Chalyan. You'll see what people think about democratic leadership. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=5.04s)]
*  This morning we have a brand new CNN poll that shows what voters are thinking about both parties. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=9.16s)]
*  David Chalyan joins me here at the Magic Wall to take us through this poll. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=14.92s)]
*  So David, what are the key takeaways? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=18.6s)]
*  Yeah, this is where we left off on election night 2024, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  but we wanted to get a sense of where Americans are right now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=23.68s)]
*  One key trend we're looking at here, Mano, is should the government do more or is the government trying to do too much? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=26.4s)]
*  58% in our new poll of Americans now say the government should do more. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=32.56s)]
*  That is a 30 year high that we have seen. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=36.44s)]
*  So what's driving that? Why are so many fewer Americans saying that the government is trying to do too much? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=39.44s)]
*  Well, as you might imagine, we're seeing that movement among Republicans who are in charge of all aspects of government right now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=44.84s)]
*  Look at this huge drop from August of 23. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=52.0s)]
*  73% of Republicans said the government was doing too much. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=54.48s)]
*  That was when Joe Biden was president. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=57.28s)]
*  Now it's down to 57%. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=59.08s)]
*  But we also see this decrease in those saying government's doing too much among independents as well. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=60.36s)]
*  We also wanted to test where the country stood. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=66.12s)]
*  Now, I don't know what you can really garner from that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=69.0s)]
*  Obviously, Republicans now are more confident that if the government does stuff, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=71.44s)]
*  they're going to be happy with it because it's run by Donald Trump and Republicans. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  And what they want, I mean, maybe they want more immigration detainments, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=82.48s)]
*  but there's no indication of that in the polling. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=91.12s)]
*  Who knows what it is exactly that they want? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=93.4s)]
*  Probably lower prices, probably maybe more services. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=95.84s)]
*  Who knows? But continue. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=103.24s)]
*  But the overall number is interesting to me that it was a 30 year high, 58% saying they want the government doing more, right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=104.56s)]
*  Which is why it's the exact wrong time to be making an argument on the Democratic side about how government's red tape is the real problem here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=111.4s)]
*  And parliamentarian, please save us. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=118.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=120.68s)]
*  With the parties on various issues, OK, the crime and policing is by far and away the Republicans best advantage. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=122.64s)]
*  R plus 13 now, R plus 14 a couple of years ago. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=129.76s)]
*  But look at the economy and immigration, two key Trump issues. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=133.24s)]
*  You see, it's still a Republican advantage, but you see that advantage is narrowing on both of those key issues. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=136.28s)]
*  This gets to what I was saying, I think about some of the. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=142.52s)]
*  Now, on the economy again, that echoes, maybe they want prices to come down more, maybe they want better pay on immigration. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=145.12s)]
*  Maybe Republicans are seeing something different than I am, but the idea that we have Democrats going down to El Salvador, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=156.04s)]
*  we got Democrats fighting to get people released from from detention centers, we got Democrats arrested for detention means that people aren't happy with what's going on. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=166.56s)]
*  With the immigration work of Republicans, they've lost eight points on that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=180.88s)]
*  The anxiety people have about the economy over the terrorists that we were talking about a dead tie on world affairs. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=188.16s)]
*  Possibly the dead tie on rural affairs, but it's a minus six from where it was in November. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=193.92s)]
*  Which they sort of just sort of blew through that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=202.64s)]
*  That was the biggest one of the biggest changes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=205.0s)]
*  But be that as it may, Democrats in education and climate change have gone up or stayed the same. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=207.28s)]
*  It's gone down and abortion because they haven't done anything about it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=216.48s)]
*  They're not in a position to do anything about it, but I think people are upset about that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=221.44s)]
*  The edge education, abortion and climate change. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=226.56s)]
*  We also took a look at some key attributes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  This is how Americans sort of see the parties. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=232.72s)]
*  Which party is better described as the party with strong leaders? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  Look at this. Wow. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=239.68s)]
*  Sixteen percent of Americans say Democrats, 40 percent say that of the Republican. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=240.64s)]
*  Keep that image up there. Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries must think this is to their advantage. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=244.88s)]
*  Because their whole strategy has been do nothing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  We just watch Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=259.44000000000005s)]
*  I mean, look, we know that those law firms who cave to Donald Trump are losing clients. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  Big story in the Washington Post, I think Wall Street Journal as well. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  Why is that the case? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=273.68s)]
*  Why are law firms that cave to Donald Trump losing clients? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=275.32000000000005s)]
*  Law firms that supposedly have ingratiated themselves with the administration. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=280.16s)]
*  They're losing clients because the clients are saying, hey, if this law firm can't even protect itself. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=283.79999999999995s)]
*  From illegal activity, how are they going to protect me? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=292.88s)]
*  Which is the exact same dynamic that voters are looking at if Hakeem Jeffries can't do anything [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=299.56s)]
*  about federal officers busting through their doors and detaining a staffer for Jerry Nadler. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=307.52s)]
*  How are they going to do anything for me? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=316.36s)]
*  We're going to ask something of Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats or from Chuck Schumer and the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  Democrats, then they're going to say, we will choose the time and the place and the situation when we [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=325.68s)]
*  will help you and we will let you know when that happens. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=333.72s)]
*  Overall, no party's doing great. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=340.76000000000005s)]
*  Lots of Americans say neither of these qualities apply to either party. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  But look at how much worse off the Democrats are. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=345.68s)]
*  A party that gets things done. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  Only 19 percent of Americans say that about the Democrats. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=349.36s)]
*  Thirty six percent say it about the Republicans. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=352.44000000000005s)]
*  In fact, the only place that the Democrats are numerically head, party of the middle class, is basically a tie. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  Party of change. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=359.48s)]
*  Republicans are up. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=360.92s)]
*  Even when they're in power. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=362.08s)]
*  Party of extremism. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=364.56s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=366.08s)]
*  Hello, Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  They got what they want. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=368.4s)]
*  They've been angling for that result for my entire adult life. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=369.23999999999995s)]
*  They have a 10 percent. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=374.68s)]
*  Democrats have a 10 percent supposed advantage on the party of extremism, but it means nothing. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  It means nothing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=387.08s)]
*  It means nothing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  Also, another good I think this also indicates how both parties are quite unpopular at the end of the day. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=389.68s)]
*  But the but the entire Democratic messaging since Trump has been in politics for 10 years has been to separate him from the brand of the Republican Party. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=398.6s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=407.88s)]
*  So you could have they could have spent 10 years hanging the unpopularity of the Republicans on the neck of a more charismatic figure for it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=408.44s)]
*  Instead, they did the opposite and they tried to appeal to those Republican voters. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=416.92s)]
*  Thirty four percent say that of Democrats, 32 percent say that of Republicans. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=424.08s)]
*  But this, I think, is the most fascinating. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=427.6s)]
*  How do partisans talk about their own party? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  So among Democrats and Democratic leaders, 32 percent say Democrats are the party with strong leaders. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=435.08s)]
*  I mean, of their own kind. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=442.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  82 percent of Republican and Republican leaders say that about the GOP. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=444.36s)]
*  Only 41 percent of Democrats say they're the party that gets things done of their own kind. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=448.2s)]
*  And I will just say 51 percent, Manu, a majority of Democratic and Democratic leaners say neither party gets the party that gets things done attribute. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=453.28s)]
*  Imagine that is the whole that's the project that Democrats are working on. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=462.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=466.4s)]
*  Beyond the issues here, there's some structural problems with the Democrats. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=466.96s)]
*  And the interesting thing is, if you look at the Democratic Party, the Republican Party thinks that they're more extreme. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=470.24s)]
*  They like to pop that bag and go back just a little bit. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=477.24s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=479.92s)]
*  Sixteen percent of Republicans perceive their own party as extreme. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=481.44s)]
*  Nine percent of Democrats perceive themselves extreme. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=484.28s)]
*  So the problem isn't that Democratic voters are viewing their party as being, you know, too crazy. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=489.56s)]
*  Too pro trans, too pro trans. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=497.76s)]
*  Right. That's like what the argument was, is they went too woke. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=500.44s)]
*  They see them not as the party of change, not as the party that gets things done, not of the party of strong leaders. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=503.64s)]
*  That's Democrats. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=510.84s)]
*  Never mind Republicans perception of Democrats that way. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=511.8s)]
*  They are failing to convince their own party. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=516.8s)]
*  Never mind failing to convince Republicans. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=521.76s)]
*  But they but but rest assured, they have a plan which they will decide upon at a time and place of their own choosing. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=524.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=533.08s)]
*  We'll be waiting. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=533.28s)]
*  APAC will make sure that their encompasses safe and that nothing changes. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=534.2s)]
*  Project the Democrats are working on. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=539.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=540.9200000000001s)]
*  Beyond the issues here, there's some structural problems with the Democrats as well. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=541.2s)]
*  There are. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=545.12s)]
*  And again, this is where we ended up on election night in 2024. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=545.6s)]
*  This is by count. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=550.08s)]
*  Obviously, these were the results. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=551.16s)]
*  But what I want to show you on this next map is we have this amazing opportunity. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, a candidate three times in a row to look at those three successive elections and take a look here among the shifts that we saw across the country. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=557.0s)]
*  Everywhere you see red here is a place that Donald Trump improved his performance from 16 to 20 to 24. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=567.16s)]
*  Now, he lost some of these counties. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  He didn't win all of them. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=576.2s)]
*  He lost some of these counties. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=577.28s)]
*  He lost some of these counties. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=578.88s)]
*  He didn't win all of them. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=580.12s)]
*  But you see how much more red there is than blue places where Clinton did better than Obama Biden did better than Clinton. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=581.28s)]
*  Harris improved on that. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=588.2399999999999s)]
*  Far fewer places in America than when Donald Trump increased his vote share over those three successive presidential elections. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=589.64s)]
*  Monty. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=596.68s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  And I would add those places where you see a blue shift. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=598.64s)]
*  Look a little bit less populated. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=603.8s)]
*  And at least in North Dakota, it is the two reservation areas. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5S6WdMbRI&t=606.32s)]
