# Trump Suggests Ethnically Cleansing Gaza
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU)
*  Over the weekend, Trump spoke to reporters on Air Force One about Gaza, about what the plan is, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=0.0s)]
*  the day after plan that we've been hearing about since this genocide began. The Gaza Strip almost [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=8.72s)]
*  is entirely destroyed. The United Nations estimates that 92% of homes in Gaza are either destroyed or [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=14.8s)]
*  damaged. So what's next? This is Trump speaking to reporters about what will happen to the folks in Gaza. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=23.6s)]
*  There's many, many conflicts at site. I don't know, something has to happen. It's literally a demolition site right now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=53.6s)]
*  Almost everything is demolished and people are dying there. So I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=64.16s)]
*  and build housing in a different location where they can maybe live in peace with each other. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=72.16s)]
*  Could be temporary, could be long term if you heard him at the end basically speaking about the displacement of people in Gaza. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=78.16s)]
*  Smotrich responded to these comments, one of the far right ministers in Israel, with immense glee saying that it's an excellent idea [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=90.72s)]
*  and such an innovative solution Mr. Trump, President Trump, King Trump if you will. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=105.36s)]
*  It's what they've wanted to do for a long time. What is fair to say is that Donald Trump is just putting [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=111.36s)]
*  words to the actions that the Biden administration already undertook. The reason that this small strip of land is so valuable [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=118.48s)]
*  is like Trump talks about it being a waterfront property where they can build luxury condos. That's a part of it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=129.6s)]
*  But for the Israelis, they wanted to make the environment in Gaza so inhospitable to human life [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=136.16s)]
*  that it would force the people of Palestine to forget their homeland. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=147.76s)]
*  And when you see the images of the tens of thousands of Palestinians returning to Gaza City in the north today, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=153.76s)]
*  you can see that no matter how much blood they spill, that memory and that desire to return home is still there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=162.16s)]
*  But the problem here is that Donald Trump is going to be responsive only really to the wills [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=173.04s)]
*  of the Israelis. That $100 million that Miriam Adelson poured into his campaign is going to probably be a major factor here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=181.2s)]
*  As well as giveaways to his real estate developer buddies, including potentially his son-in-law, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=192.48s)]
*  to make, I don't know, a Trump casino or something like that and build it upon the skulls of dead Palestinian children in Gaza. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=198.24s)]
*  But the reason that he's even able to make this case and that this could actually happen, let's be clear, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  is because the Biden administration greenlit this genocide that could be the step that precedes the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=213.36s)]
*  ethnic cleansing of Palestinians fully from the strip. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=222.0s)]
*  I mean, Blinken literally floated this privately. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=224.56s)]
*  You know, what's happening is they're selling a very similar policy to two different audiences. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  And so Trump's going to, okay, 2000 pound bombs, which like that was the one break that Biden put on Israel is just a joke, pointless. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=232.8s)]
*  But Blinken wanted to ask Egypt and Jordan to take refugees permanently, too. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=243.12s)]
*  And it's, you know, everyone points out how it rhymes with the sort of Nazi view of Jewish people during World War II. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=250.72000000000003s)]
*  This thing you hear from Zionists and defenders of Israel say nobody wants them either. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=258.24s)]
*  They don't want them either. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=262.88000000000005s)]
*  But one thing that's a little bit different is that those countries know that if they accepted a bunch of refugees [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=264.24s)]
*  and any intelligence got back to Israel that some of those people that you ethnically cleansed and did a genocide to, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=269.92s)]
*  that they have some, they're like Hamas or something, then Egypt and Jordan know that Israel's going to start bombing them, too. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=277.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, right. It's not just that. That's a great point. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=285.52s)]
*  It's not just the destabilizing nature of having to take in millions of people. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, the Trump administration is currently operating in effort to mass deport people who are here, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=294.08s)]
*  sometimes legally, sometimes without the proper documentation. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=303.44s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily matter saying we can't take on these many people. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=307.28s)]
*  We can't do it. But at the same time, oh, the Arab countries, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=310.24s)]
*  they'll take the other Arabs because in his racist view of the Middle East, there's no such thing as Palestinian. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=314.32s)]
*  So this is his vision of might makes right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=319.92s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily matter. No attempt at any consistency here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=323.2s)]
*  Jordan, Egypt, just take all these people because Israel doesn't want them. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=327.12s)]
*  We don't want them, whatever. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=331.2s)]
*  And Israel needs to make its buffer zone permanent. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  Yep. And take a look at the Democrats that supported the Lake and Riley Act and just pick one at random [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=336.4s)]
*  and see if they took money from APAC or DMFI. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=342.64s)]
*  I would suggest that you'd be hard pressed to find more than one that didn't. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=347.84s)]
*  People have a right not to be displaced from their homes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=355.84s)]
*  I think this is like a bit of the public education that this genocide has kind of forced upon people. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=359.84s)]
*  When we talk about colonialism and I think, you know, younger people in the West begin to understand what it means, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  this forced displacement is extremely traumatizing and. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  Immoral in so many ways outside of just the genocide of it all, like people have a right to put their roots down where they need to, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=381.12s)]
*  to make a better lives life for themselves. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=390.32000000000005s)]
*  And you can see it in both this effort to deport so many people and in the way that Trump so cavalierly talks about ethnically cleansing [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=393.76s)]
*  over a million Palestinians that remain in the Gaza Strip is that you do not have a right to safety and to home. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=403.76s)]
*  You do not have a right to put your roots down and to stay where you want to and live where you want to. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=410.16s)]
*  That is the right of the West and of white capitalists, basically. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=415.76s)]
*  And so that is the kind of ideological through line between between those two things. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=420.96s)]
*  Hey folks, once again, Trump's personnel picks are all about loyalty over expertise. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=428.16s)]
*  He named election denier, Kerry Lake, to lead the Voice of America. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=432.16s)]
*  That's the US funded broadcaster meant to provide unbiased news to global audiences. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=436.16s)]
*  Well, ground news found hundreds of articles covering this, all concerned about VOA's and the United States' [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=442.16s)]
*  editorial independence. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=447.35999999999996s)]
*  But you'll still find the America First crowd arguing that this appointment will quote restore balance and fairness. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=452.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, in reality, we're losing independent journalism and government transparency, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=458.96s)]
*  setting the stage for propaganda masquerading as credible information. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=464.4s)]
*  That's why I've trusted my partners at ground news for years to help me critically analyze the news I consume. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  They're the only app that's not telling you what to think. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=475.52s)]
*  Instead, they gather all the headlines, organize them by story, and then add data to each outlet's bias, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=477.91999999999996s)]
*  their credibility and their financial incentives. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  So you know exactly who's benefiting from the spin. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=487.12s)]
*  Take it one step further and filter out questionable sources to stay on top of what's happening without getting buried in the noise. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=490.47999999999996s)]
*  Trump is shaping our future in ways that's going to last for decades. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  And if not paying attention, we're letting history repeat itself. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  So stay engaged with ground news, who's fixing what's breaking right in front of us, trust and transparency in the media. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfv_KsPbAEU&t=504.96s)]
