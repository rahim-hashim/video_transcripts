# Video Exposes Israel's Massacre Of Paramedics
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE)
*  In late March, workers in Gaza who were aid workers, ambulance crews, people rescue workers, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=0.0s)]
*  who were sent to the scene of an airstrike around Rafa in the south part of the Gaza Strip, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=8.56s)]
*  and they never returned. Israel, of course, initially denied that these 15 medics were [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  killed by the IDF. This is what they do every single time. They said, we didn't do it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=21.12s)]
*  Then they claim it's a mistake. Right. Oh, and then they claim, well, they didn't have their [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=29.36s)]
*  sirens on, their lights on. So we didn't know who these folks were. Many of them were zip tied, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=33.84s)]
*  hands behind their back, found in this mass grave. And there has now been footage, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  video that was released that contradicts their claim and debunks it that they didn't have their [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=51.44s)]
*  emergency lights on. And of all places, Fox News did a report on this debunking this narrative. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=57.12s)]
*  Here is that report and credit to whoever the producer and reporter is on this story who got [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=66.72s)]
*  this through. But this did air on Fox News the other day. And this is a very good segment. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=73.12s)]
*  Paramedics from the Palestine Red Crescent dig through the earth of southern Gaza. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  They're recovering the bodies of their colleagues killed by Israeli forces. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=86.72s)]
*  On March 23, first responders were dispatched to this area of Rafa. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=91.28s)]
*  When they arrived, Israeli soldiers opened fire. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=96.24s)]
*  Health focus should never be a target. And yet we're here today digging up a mass grave [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=104.4s)]
*  of first responders and paramedics. On March 31, the IDF provided a statement to Fox News, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=108.8s)]
*  saying, quote, several vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=114.8s)]
*  headlights or emergency signals. Video released five days later by the Palestine Red Crescent [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=120.88s)]
*  directly contradicts that statement. The IDF also claimed in the initial findings that nine out of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=126.96s)]
*  the 15 medics were operatives in Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Asked multiple times for evidence to support [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=132.8s)]
*  that claim, none was provided. Funerals were held late last week for those killed by Israeli [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=139.28s)]
*  bullets. Families mourning the dead, mothers trying to make sense of the senseless. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=144.48s)]
*  He went to save the martyrs and injured. And we've been waiting for him for a week. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=151.28s)]
*  We were told that he was either martyred or injured, but I realized that they had killed them [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=155.44s)]
*  from the very first moment. They had killed them and buried them underground. As bodies of these [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=160.24s)]
*  medics rest inside white plastic bags with a photo attached, the face of Rifaat Radwan stands out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=165.6s)]
*  The man who recorded his final moments with a final message. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=172.48s)]
*  Forgive me, mother. This is the path I chose to help. He said. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=177.6s)]
*  The reporter is named Trey Yengst. Good job, chief foreign correspondent for Fox News. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=185.68s)]
*  In the midst of this, Israel has now taken 50 percent of the land in Gaza. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=193.04s)]
*  They're a buffer zone to the buffer zone to the buffer zone till the entire Gaza Strip is the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=200.88s)]
*  buffer zone until it's part of Greater Israel, because the one state reality is what they're [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=204.64s)]
*  trying to create and escalating at a rapid pace. But it's one state where they just envision [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  Israelis, one state of racial supremacy and dominance. Israel can only do this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=215.68s)]
*  When you say Israel has a right to exist, you say that this has a right to exist because Israel is [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  about creating a majority for one population at the exclusion of another population. So [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=230.0s)]
*  they're going to kill journalists. Ryan Grim just tweeted out an IDF statement that said, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=236.56s)]
*  the IDF in ISA obstructed the Hamas terrorists Hassan Abdel Fattah Mohammed Asli [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  in Khan Yunus area overnight. Grim's characterization IDF says it deliberately [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=248.08s)]
*  struck a photo journalist who was whose work was used by a range of Western media on October 7th. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=253.12s)]
*  His specific crime, according to IDF, Asli documented and uploaded footage of looting, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=258.08000000000004s)]
*  arson and murder to social media. This is what Israel is. This is what Israel is going to be [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=263.04s)]
*  as long as we support Israel. So we should stop doing it. We should stop doing it. And we believe [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=267.2s)]
*  one state reality with one democratic state. There are two options at this point. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=272.24s)]
*  One state where Israel commits genocide and ethnically cleanses the people in the West Bank [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=278.8s)]
*  and well, Gaza, they're doing a final solution right now. Let's be real. Let's be real. What's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=284.24s)]
*  happening right now in Gaza? UN health officials, I heard this this morning on Democracy Now said [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=289.2s)]
*  that at least 600000 children in Gaza are at risk of permanent paralysis because Israel has [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=296.4s)]
*  been blocking polio vaccines. There was also footage of a journalist being burned alive [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  last night. So we the it's hard. It's been a year and a half of this genocide, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=310.32s)]
*  and it's hard to come up with new angles to talk about this. But this is still happening. And in [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=319.84s)]
*  fact, we're maybe at one of the most dangerous stages of this genocide right now. Hey, folks, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7rvCUeinSE&t=324.96s)]
