**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo)
*  We are back and we are joined by our friend, Matt Lieb, and it's also his birthday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=0.0s)]
*  So everybody's got to wish him a happy birthday right away. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=6.88s)]
*  Do it. Chat. Put hearts in the chat if you want to wish me a happy birthday or say happy birthday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=9.44s)]
*  The stand-up comedian, host of podcasts, Bad Hasbra and Pod Yourself a Gun, which has now become- [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=15.52s)]
*  Mad Yourself a Man. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=22.72s)]
*  Mad Yourself a Man. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=23.76s)]
*  It is a madman podcast. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=25.6s)]
*  It used to be a Sopranos podcast. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=28.16s)]
*  But if you want to find it, you still have to put in Pod Yourself into the- [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  We've made our podcast impossible to find. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=37.12s)]
*  Yeah, deep web. Only really dedicated listeners of podcasts can find our podcast about madmen. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=41.6s)]
*  But once you find it, oh, you will enjoy it. You were on it, Emma. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  I was on it. I'm a big madman fan and I know, yes, I have a coastal elite sensibilities, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=52.559999999999995s)]
*  but I do have to say it's my favorite show of all time. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=59.04s)]
*  So it's a great show. It's a great show. I think anyone from anywhere can love it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  You know, that's what I think. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, especially if like Don, you know, you have daddy issues or something like that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=66.88s)]
*  Especially that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=73.44s)]
*  I'm not saying that's me, but some people- [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=73.84s)]
*  Not me either. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=76.72s)]
*  Not me. No, no, no. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=76.96s)]
*  Sopranos is for mommy issues. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=78.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  Madmen for daddy issues. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  Yep. You can get both. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  And The Wire. We also did The Wire and that's for societal issues. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=84.72000000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=89.2s)]
*  Yeah. It's about society. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=90.48s)]
*  That was really deep. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  It's a very deep show. If you're into deepness, listen to that. Or if you're into Israel. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=93.84s)]
*  If you love Israel, you should definitely- [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=100.4s)]
*  If you're a big fan of Israel. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  You should listen to Mad Show. Go to stand up. See your stand up next week, next Wednesday. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=104.08s)]

*  Not that it'll sell out, but- [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=129.84s)]
*  A link to that in, don't sell yourself short. We'll put a link to that in the description [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=131.92s)]
*  if people want to check it out and we'll plug it towards the end as well. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  But what city is Cobbs in? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=142.88s)]
*  It's in San Francisco. It's San Francisco, California, which is on the West Coast. So [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  if you are anywhere on the West Coast, it's just a few hours drive or it's right next to you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=151.76s)]
*  If you live in San Francisco, please come. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=158.32s)]
*  Hot tip. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=162.32s)]
*  It's my birthday. You have to go. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=163.2s)]
*  Do a nice thing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=166.0s)]
*  Do a nice thing for yourself. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  So big story this morning about our favorite, I don't know, my top pick for the live action Shrek, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=169.83999999999997s)]
*  Jon Federman. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=181.92s)]
*  Yes. My favorite professional wrestler turned senator. I don't know what he did before he was [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=183.2s)]
*  a senator. I just assumed he was a professional wrestler. And then I was told, no, he's just some [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=190.48s)]
*  Harvard guy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Just a Harvard guy who we now lessons learned, perhaps if we have candidates who have [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=197.44s)]
*  a history of like chasing down somebody with a gun and perhaps it's racially motivated that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  sometimes those aren't one-offs. Those situations can't be explained. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Egg on my face. I looked at him and I was just like, yeah, that's what we need. We need just a [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=218.24s)]
*  six foot eight white guy who just had a stroke to finally get that MAGA crowd to start seeing some [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  sense. And then he just started doing MAGA talking points. I was like, oh, that actually makes more [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=234.88s)]
*  sense. That makes more sense that he is just that guy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=241.52s)]
*  And what's fun about Federman is that all of this usual suspects had decided preemptively. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=245.6s)]
*  Well, maybe not preemptively, but once he started going down the Zionism is the most important thing [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=252.08s)]
*  ever to me down that road. There was a class of Democrats that said, this is the kind of populace [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=257.76s)]
*  that need Democrats. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=263.52s)]
*  Maddie Glacius. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=264.56s)]
*  Yeah. This is the kind of populace, the one who's going to take really unpopular positions [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  in both his party and I think more so it's happening more and more in the Republican Party. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, Iglesias is a populist. So he always says you got to just respond to the polling as a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  Democrat, but they ignore things like Israel, where a majority of Democrats that's not close [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=283.52s)]
*  now have negative feelings about it. And also ignores the fact that you can have agency over [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  public opinion as a politician by using the bully poll. But that's kind of important. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=295.84s)]
*  That's like the whole point is that's why to be a leader is when you lead. Right. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=299.84s)]
*  And then, isn't that the whole thing? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=306.48s)]
*  Maddie Glacius They don't like doing politics. They're resentful of it. But these people said [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=307.92s)]
*  this like two years after they had declared Eric Adams is the future of the tough on crime Democrat. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=312.4s)]
*  Maddie Glacius Can we maybe cut like they care about what's popular with donors. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=317.76s)]
*  That's where it comes from. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=322.48s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=323.76s)]
*  Maddie Glacius You know, right. Go ahead. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=325.44s)]
*  Maddie Glacius I mean, sure. But also, you know, what's popular with donors and other people [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=327.36s)]
*  who are sucking on the teat of those donors. And I think you forget that that's a class of people. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=334.24s)]
*  Maddie Glacius Yeah, stop ignoring that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=339.52s)]
*  Eric Adams Don't erase them. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=342.32s)]
*  Maddie Glacius Don't erase them. Those are workers. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  Those are part of the revolution is the people who are going to be actively serving [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=345.92s)]
*  the, you know, the moneyed class. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=350.96s)]
*  Maddie Glacius Would you hide them? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=353.04s)]
*  Eric Adams Yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=355.04s)]
*  Maddie Glacius Would you hide all of the personal assistants of the oligarchy? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=355.84s)]
*  Eric Adams I would. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=360.64s)]
*  Maddie Glacius I would. And so that's how, you know, we're on the red side of history here. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  So Federman was sitting. All right. Like this article is kind of sad. Spoiler alert. He's lost [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=370.32s)]
*  his mind after having a stroke. But this is someone who saw him. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=377.6s)]
*  Eric Adams The summer mob at SUMERMOB on Instagram. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  Maddie Glacius Good job, summer mob. Spotted Federman in public the other day. And this is [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  how that went down. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  Maddie Glacius Senator, do you still feel that Israel has the right to kill and kill and kill [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=395.76000000000005s)]
*  people? Do you still think Israel has the rights to defend itself still? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=401.44s)]
*  Maddie Glacius When is enough enough, Senator? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=406.88000000000005s)]
*  Eric Adams I don't know why you're harassing me. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=409.6s)]
*  Maddie Glacius That's not harassment. You're a senator, right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=412.96000000000004s)]

*  Eric Adams I'm just sitting here on a bench. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=424.24s)]
*  Maddie Glacius Right. And my people are being slaughtered because of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=425.68s)]
*  your votes and the money that you sent to Israel and your complicity in genocide. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=429.12s)]
*  Maddie Glacius You have nothing to say about that? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=435.6s)]

*  to be a human being. Yeah. What a shame. What a shame. You do not deserve the position that you have [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=467.12s)]
*  at all. Shame on you for being complicit in genocide. Shame on you. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  Maddie Glacius Agreed. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=480.0s)]
*  Eric Adams That's how you do it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=481.04s)]
*  David Cheney 100%. This should be the standard for anyone who is in a position of power [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=481.76s)]
*  or being in public. The standard should be you go up to them and tell them what they're supporting. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=489.6s)]
*  And then ask for an explanation. The idea that he's like, I'm just, listen, I just came out here [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=499.12s)]
*  in an open field to sit on bench. Like I do. Love bench. Love to sit and think. Think my thoughts. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=505.76s)]
*  What are they about? I think blood and soil. Doesn't matter what my thoughts are. I'm thinking them. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=512.96s)]
*  And I would like to be alone with my thoughts. Yeah. The idea that is like, and now you're [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=518.64s)]
*  harassing me in this position where I'm literally sitting here in public being like, oh, you know, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm just, it looks like he's waiting for a meeting. You know, it looks like he's going to feed some [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=530.48s)]
*  birds and tell them to, you know, start funding the IDF. Right. Yeah. He, it, well, it also looks [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=534.96s)]
*  like, I don't know the, this is, it's almost like the Forrest Gump scene of him sitting on the bench, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=542.48s)]
*  but instead, but instead Fetterman's imagining the woman asking him questions about the box of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=549.12s)]
*  chocolate. Just sitting there waiting for a bus. This bus is going to take me to Jerusalem. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=553.84s)]
*  We need to destroy the Al Aqsa mosque and build the third temple. Just on a loop. Can I just [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=565.84s)]
*  really remedial for folks for a second? That's a Senator of our nation here. The Senate is one of [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=572.2399999999999s)]
*  our bodies of Congress. It's supposed to be the greatest deliberative body on earth. Does anyone [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=578.9599999999999s)]
*  watching this think that they can't deliberate better than that guy sitting on that bench? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=584.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the problem is, is that I want to, this article that just came out this morning [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=590.88s)]
*  in New York magazine is expansive about John Fetterman. So great reporting by Ben Terrace [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=598.88s)]
*  of New York magazine. I want to be sympathetic because as I'll read in some of these experts, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=606.48s)]
*  excerpts, it's abundantly clear that he has, he has lost his mind. But the problem is, is that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=612.4s)]
*  then perhaps he needs to be removed from the Senate because he is voting for genocide, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=619.6s)]
*  but there's a lot of money, moneyed interests like APAC that are okay with somebody who's [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=624.16s)]
*  functionally basically like brain dead. Right. As long as they vote to send weapons to Israel. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=629.04s)]
*  I think this is what they, they would much rather have someone who's just going to, you know, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=634.4s)]
*  like the, all they have left of their brain is the lizard part. That's just like eat chicken, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=640.24s)]
*  sleep, you know, go pee pee, go poo poo, vote for weapons for Israel. Like that's all they really [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  want. They don't want anyone who's actually going to have any like critical thinking skills or [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=651.04s)]
*  someone who is going to bend to the will of their constituents because, you know, they want, you [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=655.04s)]
*  know, yeah, they want people to vote for Israel. That's it. And I saw Zach Zachary Carter say this [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=661.68s)]
*  like that. Now there's this man with serious mental health struggles and it's now indistinguishable [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  from the bipartisan foreign policy of the United States. And that kind of tracks. But this is how [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=674.48s)]
*  this opens this piece. It's called all by himself over in New York magazine. When John Fetterman was [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=679.84s)]
*  released from Walter Reed hospital in March, 2023, Adam Gentleson, then his chief of staff was proud [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=686.48s)]
*  of his boss for seeking help for what the Senator's office and his doctor had said was a case of [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=691.52s)]
*  clinical depression. His six weeks of inpatient care had been the latest medical setback for the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=695.6s)]
*  Pennsylvania Democrat who had a stroke, a mere months before being elected to the U S Senate in [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=700.4s)]
*  2022, nearly derailing his campaign against Republican met met Oz. But a year after his [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=707.52s)]
*  release from the hospital, Fetterman's behavior had so alarmed Gentleson that he had resigned his [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=714.0s)]
*  position. I should say that Gentleson was kind of defensive of Fetterman for a while. And I remember [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=718.24s)]
*  being critical of Gentleson in particular. And I'll say he's still bashing the left in a way that [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=723.84s)]
*  I don't think this, this really, I think this is protecting his legacy a little bit. I wouldn't, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=728.3199999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't have Gentleson back on this program, which he has been on this program before. I [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=734.32s)]
*  wouldn't have him back on this program. He need to do a lot more than this, in my opinion. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=738.0s)]
*  He went on the record. And of course, there's some career self preservation here. I'm cynically [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=741.2s)]
*  grateful for this information at the very least, but agreed. Yeah. But after his release from the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=747.12s)]
*  hospital, Fetterman's behavior had so alarmed Gentleson that he resigned his position in May, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=754.1600000000001s)]
*  2024. He wrote an urgent letter to David Williamson, the medical director of the traumatic [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=757.84s)]
*  brain injury and neuropsychiatry, neuropsychiatry unit at Walter Reed, who had overseen Fetterman's [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=761.92s)]
*  care at the hospital. I think John is on a bad trajectory and I'm really worried about him. The [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=768.0799999999999s)]
*  email began. If things didn't change, Gentleson continued. He was concerned Fetterman quote, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=772.4s)]
*  won't be with us for much longer. His 1600 word email came with the subject line concerns and it [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=777.5999999999999s)]
*  contained a list of them from the seemingly mundane. He eats fast food multiple times a day. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=783.76s)]
*  Okay, easy. That's the mundane part. I like that too, because it's just like, well, he just had a [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=788.64s)]
*  stroke. Right. Well, I mean, right. That's a good point. That's like, they're like, no, that's not [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=795.92s)]
*  even the worst of it. Him actively trying to kill himself with McDonald's is not the worst of it. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=803.76s)]
*  Right. Right. That's benign here. To the scary, we don't know if he is taking his meds and his [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=808.16s)]
*  behavior frequently suggests he is not. We often see this kind of warning signs we discuss. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=814.16s)]
*  Gentleson wrote conspiratorial thinking, megalomania. For example, he claims to be the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=819.36s)]
*  most knowledgeable source on Israel and Gaza around, but his sources are just what he reads [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=823.36s)]
*  in the news. He declines most briefings and never reads memos. High highs and low lows, long [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=828.16s)]
*  rambling, repetitive and self-centered monologues, lying ways. They're painfully awkwardly obvious [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=834.4s)]
*  to everyone in the room. Fetterman was, according to Gentleson, avoiding the regular checkups advised [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=838.88s)]
*  by his doctors. He was preoccupied with the social media platform X, which he previously admitted [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=843.84s)]
*  had been a major accelerant of his depression. He drove his car so recklessly, Gentleson said [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=848.96s)]
*  that the staff that staff refused to ride with him. He had also brought bought a gun. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=854.72s)]
*  What? Well, I got to get my staff in the car somehow. Was a black guy jogging nearby? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=862.1600000000001s)]
*  I didn't know DC was so, uh, let's just say diverse, right? Just a diverse. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=868.5600000000001s)]
*  Got to protect myself here. Another red flag. Gentleson added every person who was supposed [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=875.76s)]
*  to help him stay on his recovery plan has been pushed out. He damaged personal relationships, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=880.32s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. There's also stuff about delusions. Just keep going. There's this, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=885.36s)]
*  I highlighted all of these different parts. Um, but you know, there's stuff where he thinks he's [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=891.2s)]
*  being followed, right? Uh, okay, let's go. DSA is gang stalking. Yes. Go to, if you could search [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=898.8s)]
*  members of his team and the paragraph that starts from that, it's a little further down. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=906.08s)]
*  Members of his team told me this was an early warning sign that something was off with their [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=910.16s)]
*  boss in early February, 2023, after Fetterman had indeed been sworn in members of the Senate [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=913.92s)]
*  gathered at the library of Congress for a caucus retreat. Fetterman fresh off a hard fought victory [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=918.56s)]
*  in the cycles marquee race should have been riding high. Only he wasn't a staffer recalled [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=923.4399999999999s)]
*  getting a text from a person at the retreat saying if their boss was okay, Fetterman was [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=928.4s)]
*  sitting at a table by himself, slowly sipping a Coke and refusing to talk with anybody. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=932.56s)]
*  Later that day, another staffer heard an alarming port from a journalist. Fetterman had just walked [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=938.4s)]
*  obliviously into the road and was nearly struck by a car. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=945.2s)]
*  This is amazing. This is like, I don't know if you guys have ever, uh, you know, like owned a very, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=950.88s)]
*  very old dog, but there's like, at some point you're just like, what is it doing? And then [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=956.48s)]
*  you're like, oh, it's going somewhere to die. That's like, it's like, why is it spending so [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=962.96s)]
*  much time in that corner? Yeah. It's very, it's very sad. I haven't heard about anything. This is [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=968.64s)]
*  like when Nixon is after the Kent state, uh, uh, shootings. He was like wandering around the Lincoln [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=976.48s)]
*  Memorial. I think this isn't like the Oliver Stone movie, like walking around with the Lincoln [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=982.88s)]
*  Memorial and got into like fights with like, uh, anti-war activists, but like trying to make them [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=986.24s)]
*  think he was a good person. This is like Fetterman's been doing that. That was just one night for [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=990.96s)]
*  Nixon. Yeah. Nixon's entire time in the Senate. Nixon just had some stiff drinks. Like that's Trump [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=996.24s)]
*  level delusion. We're at a different level with Fetterman. It's so funny because it's, it's like, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1001.44s)]
*  this was, you know, like all of the incidents that they're citing happened like not long after he [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1006.64s)]
*  had won the election. Like as soon as he became a Senator, his attitude was like, oh, leave me alone. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1014.16s)]
*  I know. It's like, you just ran for this. Why are you mad at everyone? Why do you have the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1022.0s)]
*  disposition of like a teenager in a Disney original? Um, a week later, this is okay. This is crazy. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1027.92s)]
*  I'm sorry. Sherrod Brown maybe helped give background on this because he's named specifically. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1036.96s)]
*  A week later, democratic Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown came to pay Fetterman a visit in his new [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1043.2s)]
*  Capitol office. They seem destined to get along. Each hailed from a purplish, purplish red states [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1047.12s)]
*  and exuded an everyman energy more likely to be found in union halls than in the halls of Congress. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1052.2399999999998s)]
*  But their meeting went awry. Brown tried his best to get a conversation going, but according to two [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1057.1999999999998s)]
*  people present, Fetterman was virtually quote catatonic. He could barely string two sentences [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1062.2399999999998s)]
*  together, talking so quietly that everyone in the room had to strain to hear him. Fetterman then [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1067.84s)]
*  stood up and began walking around the office in tight loops. A move this two staffers described [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1073.12s)]
*  as doing figure eights after Brown left Fetterman pace from one room inside his office complex to [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1078.4799999999998s)]
*  another and back again. At one point, one of his aides said he walked into the hallway, peering over [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1086.8799999999999s)]
*  his shoulder as if he were being followed by shadowy figures. Hamas. That's sort of pacing. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1091.4399999999998s)]
*  That is not a good sign. No, that's pretty bad, especially like the looking over your [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1098.64s)]
*  shoulder and pacing and just being like no way out, no way out. That is, I mean, it's clear, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1103.76s)]
*  obviously, this was like, you know, before his hospitalization for whatever mental health crisis [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1110.3200000000002s)]
*  was going on, right? Yeah. And then we all celebrated him putting, you know, his mental health like [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1115.8400000000001s)]
*  forward, you know, like making that an issue because we all said, yes, we need to start [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1126.96s)]
*  talking about mental health. And then he's not a good role model for mental health. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1131.12s)]
*  It's this thing where we were all like, well, you know, obviously we're not trying to paint every [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1138.48s)]
*  person with mental health with the same brush. And also it's important to talk about these things. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1143.52s)]
*  As there are people who are depressed and assholes. That's a thing. You know what I mean? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1146.8799999999999s)]
*  You can be clinically depressed and a dick and a dick too. And if you're going to say like, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1153.12s)]
*  this is how we do it. You better be a good model for it or maybe don't put yourself on that pedestal. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1157.6799999999998s)]
*  I would just say here's another section. I don't know if you had this, Emma, but behind the scenes, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1162.6399999999999s)]
*  things are worse in March. Fetterman suddenly took an early morning trip to Hartford, Connecticut, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1166.3999999999999s)]
*  out telling his team why, leaving them at a loss to tell for what to tell Giselle, his wife, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1171.12s)]
*  when she demanded to know why he was missing one of their kids birthdays. Fetterman objected to [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1177.1999999999998s)]
*  this characterization saying to me, the writer, I took a weekend trip to in March to visit the [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1181.92s)]
*  grave site of my friend from grad school who died in 1993. A trip my staff and family knew about. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1188.64s)]
*  Yes. Okay. You mentioned, this is the last piece I'll read because you mentioned Giselle and I [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1195.6000000000001s)]
*  actually feel for her here because I don't know what's going on, but he, this is when October [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1202.3200000000002s)]
*  7th happened, this piece. It's the paragraph starts with in the days after the October 7th attack. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1210.24s)]
*  Israel declared war and retaliate with brute force, killing Hamas forces as well as thousands [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1216.0s)]
*  of civilians in the U.S. Progressives began calling for a ceasefire at least to at least pause the [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1220.16s)]
*  carnage. Fetterman felt differently. Now is not the time to talk about a ceasefire he posted in [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1225.44s)]
*  October 18th. We must support Israel in efforts to eliminate Hamas terrorists who slaughtered [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1230.96s)]
*  innocent men, women and children. The base, here it goes. Early on in the conflict, 16 of his former [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1235.6s)]
*  campaign staffers wrote a letter anonymously saying they found his full-throated support for Israel to [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1243.28s)]
*  be a quote gutting betrayal. Gentleson had been, had taken to defending Fetterman on ex from such [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1248.56s)]
*  criticisms. I had mentioned that earlier, but it wasn't just staffers who were upset. There was also [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1254.32s)]
*  Fetterman's wife, Giselle, who had been, come something of a political celebrity in her own [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1259.76s)]
*  right. She is a kindhearted philanthropist, the proprietor of a free store in Braddock that gave [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1265.3600000000001s)]
*  away goods and clothing, a formerly undocumented immigrant from Brazil and a vocal progressive. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1270.24s)]
*  In early November, just weeks after the attack, Giselle arrived at her husband's Senate office and [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1275.6000000000001s)]
*  according to a staffer present, they got into a heated argument. They are bombing refugee camps. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1280.72s)]
*  How can you support this? The staffer recalled her saying with tears in her eyes. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1285.36s)]
*  That's all propaganda, Fetterman replied. God. Later, a still visibly upset Giselle pulled the [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1289.1999999999998s)]
*  staffer aside. She asked him if members of Fetterman's team were pushing him to take these [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1296.3999999999999s)]
*  stances for political reasons. The staffer told her that the opposite was true. Many of them were as [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1300.9599999999998s)]
*  upset as she was. If you're pushing back on this, there's no hope, the staffer recalled her saying. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1308.8799999999999s)]
*  This is horrible news. That is really terrible. You would at least hope that it's like, oh, well, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1314.96s)]
*  you know, he's got a bunch of AIPAC people, lobbyists, either on staff or nearby who are [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1324.96s)]
*  pushing him to say these things. And it's like, his whole staff is like, no, he just is doing this. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1332.08s)]
*  He's doing this gratis. He's just for free. He's going to carry water for a genocide. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1338.8799999999999s)]
*  I know that maybe I'm too obsessed with these details. I promise these are the [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1347.44s)]
*  final two paragraphs, but this is just astounding to me. A few days later, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1350.56s)]
*  Giselle texted a different staffer. I am at a breaking point and can't co-sign this any longer. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1354.0s)]
*  I'd love some help in language to separate myself from this. Can anyone help me? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1358.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, gee. The language is divorce. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1364.0s)]
*  Yes. Exactly. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1366.96s)]
*  Your husband goes through this enormous health situation, like a stroke. You want to stand by him [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1370.5600000000002s)]
*  and you hope that it gets better and he gets back to his former self. But the final paragraph [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1377.1200000000001s)]
*  points out that his father, Carl Federman, an insurance executive, is very pro-Israel and would [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1382.0s)]
*  love when Federman would go on Fox News. So he's regressed to his childhood state, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1387.44s)]
*  is what it seems like. So... [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1395.04s)]
*  Uncle Carl happy. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1396.8s)]
*  There you go. Whoa. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1398.4s)]
*  I mean, listen, it's always hard to be in a marriage with two people who are very political. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1402.0s)]
*  My wife and I go through this all the time when she's trying to speak out against Palestine [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1410.6399999999999s)]
*  and I am making TikToks, making fun of the victims of Israel. It's hard. It's hard when [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1418.72s)]
*  one person cares a lot about something and the other person is a literal genocidal monster. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1427.6799999999998s)]
*  You never know who you're going to marry is the point. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1435.9199999999998s)]
*  Right. You kind of flipped a coin with Francesca and it came up to... [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1439.04s)]
*  It worked out. But hey, who knows for how long? I could have a stroke and I just turned 40. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1444.32s)]
*  I could have a stroke right now. And then all of a sudden I'm just like, you know, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1450.8s)]
*  it's great Israel and dead kids. Those are great things that I love. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1454.6399999999999s)]
*  The article also pointed out that he had kind of had these positions before October 7th, right? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1460.8s)]
*  That he had been a pro-Israel. But there is part of me that has trouble fully buying [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1467.04s)]
*  a commitment this strong. You know what I mean? Like a commitment to Israel this strong does feel [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1481.12s)]
*  like stroke-based. You know what I mean? Yes. It's not to say he didn't have major [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1489.6s)]
*  problems as a politician before. Ben Burgess, I mean, before Fetterman was even elected, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1496.16s)]
*  had a piece saying he's basically progressive except for Palestine. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1500.48s)]
*  But this is the kind of thing that, you know... Puts it into overdrive. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1505.2s)]
*  Right. And why don't we have any mechanisms to deal with this kind of break? And we can talk [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1509.0400000000002s)]
*  about Biden in this instance. And frankly, well, we know that Trump's... They're not going to [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1516.16s)]
*  impeach Donald Trump because the Republicans hold the Senate and the House, but he's clearly [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1520.8s)]
*  completely lost his marbles believing the Photoshopped MS-13 knuckle thing that Stephen [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1526.24s)]
*  Miller is just like feeding to him on his desk at this point. These guys are losing it. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1532.48s)]
*  Yeah, it is wild. There's a tweet I found, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1539.2s)]
*  I'll put it up, Matt, before we let Gisele completely off the hook or cry too big of a [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1543.8400000000001s)]
*  river for her. This was in March, her posing with Netanyahu. I mean, that's not great, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1549.92s)]
*  but I mean, they said he got a gun and there's like some abusive sounding things in the article. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1558.0s)]
*  And also if you look at her body language, she is facing away from him. So as a certified body [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1564.48s)]
*  language expert, I would say that she is not into that particular situation. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1572.72s)]
*  Oh, you're trained in body language expertise. This is for your audition for Fox News. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1576.96s)]
*  I understand. That's right. Yeah. This is how I punch left. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1582.48s)]
*  Or Joy Reid, rather. She was a body language expert with her [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1585.84s)]
*  name in her. There's just one final section, I think to underline kind of like the genocidal [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1588.72s)]
*  mania this guy is. He's meeting with Jeremy Benn and me of like sort of liberal Zionist organization, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1593.3600000000001s)]
*  J Street, which is pro-Israel, pro-peace, you know, whatever. And Federman lectures the guy [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1599.12s)]
*  saying you can't reform sour milk. He told Ben Ami, according to the notes from the meeting, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1606.1599999999999s)]
*  referring to Palestinians as sour milk, Federman said he did not believe in a two state solution [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1610.56s)]
*  and claimed that he had never met an Arab person who would condemn Hamas. Correction of the notes [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1615.6s)]
*  from the meeting stated only a single Arab he has met with that staff was present for wouldn't [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1619.6799999999998s)]
*  outright condemn Hamas. Federman went on to make statements that shocked people in opposing a [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1624.64s)]
*  ceasefire. He said, let's get back to killing a person who heard the conversation told me, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1629.6000000000001s)]
*  he said, kill them all. In a statement, Federman denied the account, adding any reference to [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1635.2s)]
*  killing was solely about Hamas. And I do support the destruction of that organization down to its [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1640.3200000000002s)]
*  last member. I don't believe him. I mean, he can claim, I mean, that's the old, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1646.4s)]
*  you know, switcheroo trick would they do with the Hamas thing where it's just like, no, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1654.08s)]
*  all of my genocidal language, if I just direct it at Hamas, then I don't have to think about [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1658.16s)]
*  the fact that, you know, I consider literally every man, woman and child in Gaza to be Hamas. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1666.08s)]
*  You know, either Hamas, then that's the top tier, pre Hamas, pre Hamas, or Hamas enablers, like [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1671.44s)]
*  women that are married to Hamas. They're not overthrowing Hamas. So, you know, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1679.9199999999998s)]
*  right. Exactly. Yeah. They're Hamas voters or they're the progeny of Hamas voters. Like this is, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1683.76s)]
*  you know, they've all but stated that there is, you know, not a single uninvolved person in Gaza. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1690.1599999999999s)]
*  And, you know, you know, that Federman is buying that line hook line and sinker. So like he's, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1696.08s)]
*  you know, he can, he can play off. It's just funny to be like, no, no, I just meant Hamas [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1701.1999999999998s)]
*  saying kill them all about anybody is weird. Saying kill them all is one of those things that [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1706.56s)]
*  Nazis say. It's literally what, what movie villains will, oh, like, like, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1714.0s)]
*  that's a classic movie villain screaming, kill them all. Yeah. Or metalheads. Yeah. Well, yeah. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1721.44s)]
*  But I mean, they're just calling out for a song name they like. That's different. I'm not, I'm too [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1728.56s)]
*  posh to understand this reference. You gotta start listening to Metallica. Well, listen to, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1734.4s)]
*  listen to Reload. Reload by Metallica has some of their more like, you know, more melodic stuff. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1742.0s)]
*  You'll like it. All right. Well, thanks for the tip. So back to genocide. No, like what's been your, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1747.3600000000001s)]
*  your bad Hasbro, everybody should check it out. I really had such a great time when I was on with [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1757.2s)]
*  you. I mean, maybe that must've been like a year ago at this point. But what's been your experience [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1761.6s)]
*  covering this over the, like over the first hundred days of Donald Trump. I mean, activism [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1769.12s)]
*  for Palestine, it's, it, I mean, it's not harder. The struggle is always difficult, of course, but [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1774.9599999999998s)]
*  you have a completely untethered, unhinged administration and there's been no food that [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1783.12s)]
*  has gotten into Gaza in food, water or medicine in 60 days. And it feels like we're adding one of the [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1788.96s)]
*  most dangerous points in the genocide. Yeah. I mean, in terms of the first hundred days of [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1797.3600000000001s)]
*  the Trump administration and everything that's gone on, you know, with the genocide since it's been, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1805.2s)]
*  it's, it's gone kind of exactly how I thought it was going to go and how it was supposed to [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1812.32s)]
*  have gone this whole time. You know, you have the, the PR, you know, ceasefire, you know, this, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1817.9199999999998s)]
*  essentially a win for the Trump administration right off the bat. And it existed, I think, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1825.9199999999998s)]
*  primarily so that Trump could have this, you know, easy runway for his first hundred days that Israel [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1835.52s)]
*  couldn't help but break almost immediately. And I knew as soon as they did, you know, all of this [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1843.92s)]
*  talk of like, oh, you know, they had, you know, people going to Netanyahu and saying, you better [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1850.5600000000002s)]
*  do a ceasefire, you know, Trump wants one, you're going to do one. And then as soon as they broke [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1855.76s)]
*  it, they were like, okay, are you guys going to kill everyone? That's fine. What do you need? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1860.48s)]
*  And I was, it's just, it was, it's so clear. I mean, you know, all of the, for all of the talk [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1864.48s)]
*  about, you know, how terrible, you know, the Democrats are, which they are, you know, they were, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1869.44s)]
*  they lost this election because they could not admit to themselves or the American people that [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1877.68s)]
*  this was, you know, a genocide. I mean, you know, they lost for a ton of reasons, but I think that [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1885.28s)]
*  is a big part of it. And, and they, they ceded that ground to Trump to where he was going out [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1891.84s)]
*  and pretending like he was a dove. It was completely like ridiculous. Like people were like, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1899.9199999999998s)]
*  he could say that because they were out there, you know, being like, we gotta make sure that Israel [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1905.36s)]
*  has everything they need in order to do genocide. So anyways, the Hizbarah around that has been [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1912.08s)]
*  interesting because you, you've seen kind of a split, whereas I feel like the more [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1918.0s)]
*  liberal Zionist PR spin was kind of, I would say the mainstay of the Biden administration. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1925.52s)]
*  Now you are seeing the PR go full Betar. And if you don't know what Betar is, it's this very right [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1931.92s)]
*  wing Zionist organization that is like, they think, they think the ADL are Hamas, like that's how [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1940.8799999999999s)]
*  psychopathic they are. And, uh, I mean, he's obviously anti-Semitic. Yeah. I mean, 100%. I [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1949.44s)]
*  mean, you know, he, he is, he just doesn't know he is. Yes. Like, like future Hamas, he's future [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1956.3999999999999s)]
*  anti-Semite. We just, you know, yes. Uh, but like it is, it is wild just, uh, watching kind of, um, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1962.24s)]
*  you know, for his mask off as Israel has been, uh, it's, it's wild to watch like, oh shit, I didn't [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1970.72s)]
*  know there was more mask. Like they keep removing extra parts of the mask. And I'm like, Jesus, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1977.04s)]
*  at what point, like Netanyahu just recently said, like we, we prioritize the destruction of quote [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1983.68s)]
*  Hamas over bringing back our civilians. Like he, he's saying that out loud, which is [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1991.68s)]
*  a wild thing to say when you can just infer it using your brain. You know what I mean? Like just [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=1999.2s)]
*  look what's happened for the last 18 months. We know that. Yeah. You don't have to know he gets off [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2006.16s)]
*  on it in like the way that when Trump, they did that press conference and Trump was saying who [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2011.52s)]
*  would want to live there. It's destroyed sitting next to the man who was responsible for the [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2016.16s)]
*  destruction. He's smiling because they think they're, they're doing a little bit of a trick, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2020.8s)]
*  like in the same way that they messed with the Biden administration who was not earnestly [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2027.36s)]
*  pursuing a ceasefire, but they wanted better PR for themselves at the very least. The Netanyahu [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2032.96s)]
*  was toying with him in that way too. Yeah. Yeah. It is, it is, it's, it's wild to see. I mean, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2039.6s)]
*  the repression is obviously gotten even more insane, but you know, it's, it's, I kind of see [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2046.8s)]
*  it all as a continuation. You know, it's, this was like the logical endpoint of what the, you know, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2055.68s)]
*  Democrats have allowed to happen essentially. And that's why when I see like Cory Booker, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2065.04s)]
*  fucking Hakeem Jeffries, like any of these like centrist Dems who are talking about deportations, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2075.04s)]
*  I'm just like, you set up the dominoes. You, the idea that you're just like, who, who would, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2086.16s)]
*  who, I didn't think you guys were going to knock them down. You know? Yeah. I just thought it was [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2094.64s)]
*  like, wow, look at all these dominoes all next to each other. I thought we were just going to look [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2099.9199999999996s)]
*  at it and enjoy. Like, you know, I can't, I can't take any of them seriously. And I can't take [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2103.84s)]
*  anyone seriously, honestly, the Democratic party who doesn't, you know, full throatedly ask for, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2109.44s)]
*  you know, the, not only no weapons to Israel, but also a complete isolation of it as if it were [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2117.76s)]
*  apartheid South Africa. Cause it is, but worse. Yep. And it's our, our old producer Bradley [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2124.88s)]
*  referred one time to, to, to Cory Booker's having a Winnie the Pooh disposition. And I think about [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2132.24s)]
*  that often with him and it's used when he had a psychopathic will to power from like teenage years, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2138.24s)]
*  right? Or, but like, or not even the disposition, it's more like his, the way he presents politically. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2144.3199999999997s)]
*  And it's like, why are you wearing the, the pin that's meant to like falsely link the genocide to [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2149.2s)]
*  the return of the hostages, as you talk about like the dangers of authoritarianism, it's to talk about [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2155.4399999999996s)]
*  authoritarianism in 2025 and not for like a whole day and not mentioned Israel and what we're doing [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2161.2s)]
*  one time. That's kind of, that's well, it's, it's why liberal Zionists are fascist enablers. And I [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2167.3599999999997s)]
*  think that's like a really important way for us to refer to them because we wouldn't have the, as you [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2172.8799999999997s)]
*  say, the situation that we're in without this permission structure being created by many, many [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2179.04s)]
*  Democrats. What is, like, just to zoom out about some of how liberal Zionists are reacting, like [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2184.72s)]
*  maybe even in your life, because we've talked about this on your show too, about how there was a, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2193.2s)]
*  you know, outrage for probably like four or five months of like, I don't know, me getting [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2198.7999999999997s)]
*  freezed out, maybe you a little bit by some people after October 7th, I'm an anti-Semite, whatever. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2203.92s)]
*  Then we have, okay, like tensions begin to cool, maybe not from my end, because I'm infuriated by [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2210.96s)]
*  these people like justifying this, but like, there's now been, I think, maybe around six to eight [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2218.16s)]
*  months of these folks that were saying, anybody speaking out for Palestine or anti-Semitic, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2223.84s)]
*  it's just radio silence. And it feels like that's maybe even a longer period of that, where it's [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2229.92s)]
*  like, these people who were very vocal about the anti-Semitism in the pro-Palestine movement are [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2235.28s)]
*  just like quiet, nothing. Is there any self-reflection happening in your experience? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2241.6000000000004s)]
*  You know, I've been shocked by the lack of self-reflection. Like that truly, it's almost [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2248.96s)]
*  like a feat. It amazes me the amount of people I know who still have not, I don't know, like [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2255.76s)]
*  apologized to me. Oh, I'm going to be waiting until the end of my life for some of those. Yeah, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2265.6800000000003s)]
*  it's like, it's just for the reactions. And like the worst thing that I've seen has been a like, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2270.32s)]
*  very intense revisionism with a lot of these liberal Zionists where they'll start saying things [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2278.7999999999997s)]
*  like, you know, oh, well, everyone wanted a ceasefire. We all wanted a ceasefire. You know, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2287.52s)]
*  it's like, who doesn't want to ceasefire? We agree that they're being genocidal. They won't say [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2294.0s)]
*  genocide, but they'll say they're being genocidal. Oh, I love to be murderous and not do murdering. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2298.96s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah, just for, you know, for a treat. But like they would straight up start like calling [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2306.48s)]
*  me or my wife anti-Semitic for saying the word ceasefire in like, you know, obviously October, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2315.9199999999996s)]
*  November, December, 2023 up until like May of 2024. Just the, anyone saying ceasefire, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2323.6s)]
*  it was synonymous with being like a Hamas supporting anti-Semite. Now, I swear to God, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2331.92s)]
*  I've seen people who are straight up just, they're, they're guffawing at anyone who ever said [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2338.88s)]
*  ceasefire because they're like, yeah, we all wanted a ceasefire. Everyone is doing the thing [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2346.0s)]
*  where they're going to revise everything that they said beforehand. They're going to, they're [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2349.76s)]
*  going to change the goalposts as to what they cared about while simultaneously remaining [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2354.56s)]
*  firmly in the camp of, well, Israel's got to do what Israel's got to do. They will find whatever [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2361.44s)]
*  way to defend it that they can. And in my life, it's been, you know, for the most part, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2368.2400000000002s)]
*  people who are, you know, who at one point may have been like yelling at me about stuff, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2373.44s)]
*  texting me insane propaganda. Now, you know, where they, they don't, they still don't talk to me, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2381.28s)]
*  but they will like post like, man, that, you know, this, this Donald Trump, he is a bad guy. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2388.16s)]
*  He's a bad dude. And I'm just like, you, you, you have no right to talk about anything. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2393.92s)]
*  If you spent the first, what, 14 months of genocide, actively supporting it. And now you're [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2401.68s)]
*  just like, no, this, this Donald Trump guy, I don't know about him. You know, I think he's bad. We all [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2411.12s)]
*  need to band together. It's just like, no, F off. I do you think that that is like really for me, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2416.4s)]
*  there's this navel gazing element of, which we're all guilty of. I mean, like I, you have to have a [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2423.36s)]
*  healthy ego to put your face on camera and talk to it. So I'm not excluding myself from door from [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2429.04s)]
*  this guy. We all gaze at Navel's sure. But like the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2434.48s)]
*  thing that's been most difficult, I think to fight through with some of the, the liberal Zionists is [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2442.56s)]
*  just like, I vote Democrat. So I am a good person. I have like these very set viewpoints about like [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2446.56s)]
*  racism, but it's only in a domestic context. I don't want to think about our foreign policy. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2455.2s)]
*  I don't want to think about capitalism and its role in, you know, immiserating people in the [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2459.6s)]
*  global south and the middle East, just like that is also a part of our racist worldwide structure [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2465.52s)]
*  where, like, I don't, the idea that the greatest barrier for you to oppose one of the greatest [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2472.56s)]
*  crimes in the history of humanity that we're currently currently living through is your own [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2479.04s)]
*  personal, like narcissism about how good you are. Is there anything more privileged than that very [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2484.32s)]
*  notion? Right. Yeah. No, I mean, mad. Yeah, no, it, it, it is, it's insane. The amount of, you know, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2493.12s)]
*  how much Zionism does come from being completely self centered. But like just, or how much fascism [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2502.3199999999997s)]
*  just comes from being completely self centered. It's especially, I think it's when it's, you know, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2509.2s)]
*  like when it's liberals, it's always worse because it comes from this deeply insecure part [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2515.04s)]
*  of their psyche that defines like goodness by the perception of goodness. You know, it defines [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2523.68s)]
*  morality by the perception of they themselves being moral. And so whatever decision they make, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2531.92s)]
*  whatever position they hold must be moral because I, because they are moral. They're like, I'm good. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2540.16s)]
*  So everything I think good. And it's like this really like baby brain thing where you, you realize [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2547.6s)]
*  how many liberals are just essentially conservatives and waiting because the inability to learn the [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2552.72s)]
*  inability to self reflect is like, you know, it's like the classic, like conservative stereotype. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2558.48s)]
*  And you just, you know, people always wonder, it's like, you know, how come, you know, the youth, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2565.68s)]
*  they start out liberal, then they go conservative. And it's like, well, it's yeah, because a lot of [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2570.3999999999996s)]
*  liberalism is just, you know, completely superficial. It's not actually about learning anything or [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2574.24s)]
*  believing in anything. It is about, you know, feeling good about yourself. And, and then as soon [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2580.64s)]
*  as something affects you personally, that's why it's always starts with like taxes. Right. Or someone [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2587.2799999999997s)]
*  will just be like, you know, I, I used to believe in like, you know, gay marriage and stuff, but then [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2592.24s)]
*  I had to pay $10,000 to the IRS. And now I'll pretty much throw anyone under the bus in order to, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2597.9199999999996s)]
*  you know, in order to get that money back. Yeah. And I mean, even like you see it here, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2604.4799999999996s)]
*  especially on the, the East coast with the salt deduction fight, like the same people that were [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2610.56s)]
*  obsessed with this is just like a more upper middle class deduction that is in blue states that [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2615.6s)]
*  primarily like was that Trump eliminated the first time. It's a, it's a taxation deductions called [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2622.4s)]
*  the salt, the state and local tax deduction. And the, the, there, there's a fight, you know, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2629.92s)]
*  with like the Josh Gottheimer and the conservative Democrats, and then the moderate Mike Lawler [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2636.88s)]
*  Republicans are want to bring back the salt deduction, but Trump initially used it as a way [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2642.48s)]
*  to punish blue states. And I just see this like all liberal Zionists are all like, you ask them [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2646.96s)]
*  about taxes and they're like, God, you know, I hate Trump because of that salt deduction thing. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2652.88s)]
*  It's like, Oh, you hate Trump now because he made your taxes go up by like a small amount. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2657.04s)]
*  Yeah, that it is. It is like, it is crazy. The amount of this is why it's so funny to talk to [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2664.2400000000002s)]
*  a liberal Zionist because I enjoy hearing it's like, so what do you care about? Because that's [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2670.08s)]
*  always fascinating to me to be able to compartmentalize like it used to be, you were compartmentalizing [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2677.6s)]
*  something that was, you know, like, um, without doing any further reading, you could just assume [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2684.08s)]
*  Israel good, you know, it was like, especially if you were, you know, grew up loving Israel or [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2690.4s)]
*  thinking Israel was, you know, belong to you because of, you know, past Jewish trauma and [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2696.08s)]
*  whatnot. But now like, you know, genocide happening and to be able to compartmentalize that and still [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2702.72s)]
*  be like, you know, complaining about the salt tax, like that's, that's incredible to me. It's like, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2712.16s)]
*  I want to, I want to like dive into that brain and swim around for a bit. Yeah. I just want to see [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2717.92s)]
*  what other little pockets of weird shit you've been like suppressing. I should correct myself. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2722.32s)]
*  It's Trump cap to the salt deduction. So it limited it to, you couldn't do, you know, tens of [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2727.2000000000003s)]
*  thousands of dollars. It was that 10 K. Yeah. 10,000. Yeah. Yeah. But that's just one example I can [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2732.0800000000004s)]
*  think of. But, um, but yeah, I mean, even in deportations and shit like that, I mean, you see [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2737.36s)]
*  the amount of like, you know, these are the same liberals who were at the anti-ice protests, uh, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2742.0800000000004s)]
*  you know, back, uh, in what, you know, during the Trump administration, the Muslim ban, they were [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2749.36s)]
*  against that a hundred percent. And, and now it's like, you know, they, some of them will still, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2754.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, march against Trump and I'll be like, you, you, you have seen the amount of students [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2761.6s)]
*  they are deporting for writing essays or attending marches. You're, you're attending a march. How do [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2768.32s)]
*  you live with this in your brain? It's, it's, it's wild. It's, uh, because those marches are, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2775.44s)]
*  and it's nice to see people in the streets, but it's just about demonstrating your opposition, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2781.2000000000003s)]
*  where it comes back to the navel gazing thing, uh, as opposed to having concrete demands, like, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2785.76s)]
*  which is an actual threat. The pro-Palestine demonstrations are about divesting from is like [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2793.2000000000003s)]
*  very, very specific. Yeah. Divest from Israel. That's what it was. And it wasn't even [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2798.64s)]
*  that it was like, Hey, a school, our students said divest from Israel. Listen to them. Right. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2805.36s)]
*  Yeah. It is. It's wild. It's such a specific demand. I talked to a liberal Zionist recently who said, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2811.44s)]
*  um, that he was like, uh, you know, I think they shouldn't have done the encampments, all that stuff [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2816.6400000000003s)]
*  because it's like people get annoyed by that. You know, it's like bad optics. And also it's like, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2822.2400000000002s)]
*  what do they even want? And I was like, you did you not talk to anybody? I know, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2826.8s)]
*  I know, but they're recycling the occupy, uh, the anti-occupy critique. What do they even want? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2833.2s)]
*  What the, no, I mean, okay. I'm sorry. You cannot make that critique of these protesters. Their [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2840.72s)]
*  demands are right in front of you. Yes. Yes. It's completely ridiculous. It's on signs. It says, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2846.8s)]
*  yes. Yeah. Um, anyway, uh, what'd you say? You want to do this? Do you have, okay. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2853.6s)]
*  I don't know if Matt's got to go. There's another Federman. I don't got to go. I don't, I don't, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2861.52s)]
*  I don't got shit. This is my birthday. I told my wife, I told my wife, I'm doing whatever I want [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2864.88s)]
*  today. I'm going to go on majority report. We're going to talk about Federman's weird ass. Let's [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2871.04s)]
*  go nuts. We got another Federman clip here. Another time where he's seated and seemingly [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2876.56s)]
*  unaware of his surroundings this time in public, in, in, uh, or at least on an airplane. This is [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2882.8s)]
*  from a prem talker of a video from February when John Federman got in an argument with a pilot [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2888.16s)]
*  about wearing his seatbelt. So it was visible. And, uh, and this was cited in that extensive [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2893.04s)]
*  New York magazine piece. Of course he's getting in fights with fucking flight attendants. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2898.24s)]
*  It's okay. It's okay. Okay. It's okay. But it just has to be visible to the [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2907.2s)]
*  public. It's a federal regulation. So if you're able to do seatbelts on just pass the [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2914.0s)]
*  one right now. It's an office. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2919.0400000000004s)]
*  I'm depressed. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2924.88s)]
*  Bro, what are we doing? The point of a seatbelt is for me to be safe. Right? I don't want to be [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2931.5200000000004s)]
*  safe. I want to die. I'm trying to die. I'm thinking about my friend from grad school that [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2940.08s)]
*  died in 1993. He died anyway. Wouldn't it be amazing if he was going to Israel and some sort [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2946.56s)]
*  of like death wish? He wants a Hamas rocket to fall on him so fucking bad. Just walks into the sea. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2958.08s)]
*  If he really wants to die, you know, just hop aboard an aid flotilla. You know, do that [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2967.2s)]
*  if you really want to get killed. Yeah. It is. It's so funny. These like [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2976.56s)]
*  Federman videos that keep coming out and every it's like, it's like every picture of glum Keanu [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2981.6s)]
*  met every picture of glum Ben Affleck. You're just like, there's not a single phrase like [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2990.2400000000002s)]
*  whatever. It's a photogenic version of always looking depressed. But he is, I think he is [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=2998.8s)]
*  actually very, a very, very sad man, which I mean, you know, that's just called karma, I think. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=3004.64s)]
*  Yeah. I'd like to be asking him like, Hey, can you talk about how important joy is to your life? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=3012.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Can you speak on joy? Yeah. Well, it is wild. Yeah. He should, he should [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=3016.88s)]
*  probably watch Inside Out. It'll help him identify his emotions. That's right. That's right. That'll [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=3024.48s)]
*  help. Yeah. Matt Lieb, we're, we really appreciate your time today. Happy birthday, my friend. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BYLkDb4rBo&t=3030.08s)]
