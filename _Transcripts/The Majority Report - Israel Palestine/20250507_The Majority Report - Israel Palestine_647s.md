# US Complicity In Israel's Gaza Starvation Is Policy, Not Accident
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o)
*  I wanted to start here. We can't drop the ball on how Israel just continues to bomb Gaza, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=0.0s)]
*  including on top of its starvation campaign. The Gaza government says that more than 3,500 children [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=7.92s)]
*  face imminent death by starvation at the current moment. It's been over two months of a total [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=16.8s)]
*  blockade by Israel of all medicine, food, and water. And I guess honestly this is [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=23.36s)]
*  probably the best time to bring to show this footage here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=31.28s)]
*  Just before we play this, I'm still waking up to see on the timeline of Twitter things like, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=36.64s)]
*  oh, a restaurant was bombed in Gaza, killing dozens of people. And then the immediate [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=42.16s)]
*  replies of people who pay Elon Musk to get a check mark saying, I thought people were starving in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=47.6s)]
*  Gaza. And you're saying there's a restaurant? The sort of nasty genocidal frenzy. I mean, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=52.96s)]
*  obviously just because there's a restaurant doesn't mean there's food at a restaurant, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  idiots. And just like the sort of casual, I mean, this is the stuff you used to talk about [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=66.56s)]
*  with like Radio Rwanda and stuff. And you see this is just a huge part of society with [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=72.4s)]
*  beepers in their user names on Twitter and stuff like that. We have a profound sickness that's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=76.72s)]
*  galloping across the world right now. And I think that part of why liberalism is failing [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=82.32s)]
*  to confront so many of the different maladies in our society right now can be, you can trace it [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=87.36s)]
*  back to that because I think there's this impulse by many liberals to think that like everybody [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=92.72s)]
*  wants the same things, but we just have to find the right way to work together as opposed to a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=98.88s)]
*  more militant left-wing approach, which means, no, there are some people that need to be defeated [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=104.0s)]
*  either by taking their money and redistributing it to the wealth, to the less wealthy, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  Redistributing resources via the government, via taxation, or whether it's like, no, these people [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  can't be reasoned with. They're lying on purpose to justify genocide and they like it. They know [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  what they're doing to these folks. They like images like you're about to see. This is the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=129.76000000000002s)]
*  Associated Press, obviously run by Hamas. I want to warn people that this is difficult to watch, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=134.64s)]
*  but it's important to show this. These are children in Gaza just days ago. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=141.2s)]
*  The child is four months old. She suffers from extreme low weight because of severe acute [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=155.04s)]
*  malnutrition. Those kids usually are lactose intolerant and regrettably there's no alternative [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=159.44s)]
*  inside Gaza because of the war and the border closures and the lack of special treatment milk. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=166.56s)]
*  This is a doctor speaking at Nasser. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=176.24s)]
*  You can see this child. There's no meat in the market. Go ahead, Matt. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=178.8s)]
*  That special treatment milk that he mentions, we do have like a long-standing critiques of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  the impact of USAID and the uses it's been put towards, but the complete just pulling the rug [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=196.24s)]
*  out from under a program, guess what? USAID was paying for this sort of malnutrition assistance [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=202.0s)]
*  for Gaza children. It's disgusting. It's not like an attack on the deep state that Trump got [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=207.04s)]
*  rid of that. It's very important just to build on what you're saying. The kind of food and nutrients [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=213.12s)]
*  that addresses this level of malnutrition is basically like a pace because when you're at this [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=224.88s)]
*  point near death via starvation, your body's going to reject almost everything. It needs to be [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  protein rich and easily digestible. And this is what USAID, what Trump caught in USAID. And this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=236.96s)]
*  also applied to other nations in the world too. Like that, you can see that pace there a little [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=243.36s)]
*  bit. There's no meat in the market, no source of protein. Canned food is running out. There's no [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=253.12s)]
*  nutrition at all. Even healthy children with no diseases have started to come to us showing signs [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=259.2s)]
*  of lack of food, weakness, frailty and repeated gastric flu, all because of weakened immunity as [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  a result of lack of food that helps them grow in a healthy way. It's important to show that footage. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=276.24s)]
*  And just a reminder, as Israel announces that it's going to take the entire Gaza Strip, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=285.52s)]
*  they've already seized 50% of its territory. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  And in the discussion- There goes a liberal Zionist talking point. Well, they left the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=300.56s)]
*  Right. What do you want them to do? Oh, they took it back? Who would have- They had it the whole time. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=305.68s)]
*  Surrounded by guns. It's just so frustrating that people can't conceive of an open air prison [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=311.84s)]
*  like this. They do not control their borders, land or sea. They don't have an airport. They don't have [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=319.44s)]
*  a- Well, they have Hamas as a militant group, but they don't have an air force. They don't have a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  state. That's part of why Israel will never agree to a two-state solution. It's one state democratic, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  a one democratic state from the river to the sea, both Palestinians and Israelis living together. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=339.36s)]
*  Or it is one state with just Israelis. And that's the reality they're trying to create now through [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=344.72s)]
*  genocide. And some people might object to those images saying, you know, maybe not all, hashtag [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=350.56s)]
*  not all Israelis want to see those images. The truth is a big enough majority of them prefer [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  those images than what Emma is saying, which is one person, one vote. And also people who were [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=365.68s)]
*  expelled through conquest and war crimes get the right of return to where they were expelled from. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=372.0s)]
*  Right. Israelis don't want to see that. They need a designist here, whether they're Mike Huckabee [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=379.92s)]
*  or Chuck Schumer. Here is Netanyahu lying just per- You know, lying about what they now are doing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  They were just waiting for the right opportunity. And Donald Trump's presidency is perfect for him. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=393.76s)]
*  I want to make a few points absolutely clear. Israel has no intention of permanently occupying [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=400.08s)]
*  Gaza or displacing its civilian population. Israel is fighting Hamas terrorists, not the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=405.76s)]
*  Palestinian population. And we are doing so in full compliance with international law. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=412.16s)]
*  The IDF is doing its utmost to minimize civilian casualties while Hamas is doing its utmost to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=418.08s)]
*  maximize them by using Palestinian civilians as human shields. The IDF urges Palestinian civilians [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=424.4s)]
*  to leave war zones by disseminating leaflets, making phone calls, providing safe passage [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  corridors. War zone is a special word that Israelis use for land they're about to steal. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=436.23999999999995s)]
*  We got it. I mean, you heard that that's from January 2024. We know that that's contradicted. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=443.91999999999996s)]
*  And also we're hearing that there are talks right now with the United States about helping administer [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=449.84s)]
*  the Gaza Strip via military contractors. You can probably hear Eric Prince salivating from here. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=458.24s)]
*  And there was a source that spoke to the Reuters that's compared the proposal to the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=467.52s)]
*  Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, which is what went so well, which was the government that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=475.12s)]
*  the United States tried to impose on the Iraqi people when we were trying to overturn Saddam [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  Hussein's power. And then said, here's a bunch of think tank freaks from the Heritage Foundation [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=492.08s)]
*  or the American Enterprise Institute or whatever. They're going to be your new kings. They're like [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  30 years old. But isn't that and when you look at that proposal, the United States was heavily [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=503.35999999999996s)]
*  reliant on mercenaries, private mercenaries with Eric Prince and Blackwater. And that's the proposal [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=509.91999999999996s)]
*  again. So we're about to talk to Austin Coker about how the Trump administration is using [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=517.28s)]
*  something called a 287-G agreement to try to enlist local police and sheriffs to help with [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=524.24s)]
*  their deportation regime. You know, the first time that that was ever deployed was in 2002 [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=532.0s)]
*  in Florida with Jeb Bush as the governor in reaction to 9-11. Everything we're seeing [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=539.2s)]
*  right now, Richard Beck's book Homeland is an exhaustive examination of this, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=547.2s)]
*  is an outgrowth of the war on terror and the erosion of our civil liberties from that point. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=552.88s)]
*  And of course, neoliberalism and our the economic conditions and how we have no social services to [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=559.2s)]
*  offer people only like cheap goods and consumerism and people are revolting against that economic [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=566.0s)]
*  model because it doesn't provide much for them. Fascism has a clear vision and clear enemies. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=572.96s)]
*  And that's what unfortunately we voted in and our democratic leaders aren't meeting the moment on [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=578.08s)]
*  this front. But in terms of the deportation and fascistic infrastructure that's currently [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=583.28s)]
*  being deployed, you can trace it back to 9-11. And this is why we're here right now. And we're [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=589.2s)]
*  circling back to a proposal that echoes our Iraqi occupation for Gaza. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=595.44s)]
*  That's the reality of where we're at right now. And it's a failure of the two democratic presidents [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=606.8800000000001s)]
*  that came in between the Bush era and Trump 2.0 for not doing more to rebuild [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=612.48s)]
*  our institutions to prevent this kind of thing [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=618.88s)]
*  because they selfishly wanted to use that power for their own ends. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlUoyp4PI3o&t=624.08s)]
