# Dem Grills Stefanik During Confirmation Hearing
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [January 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs)
*  U.M. Ambassador, Elisa Stefanik, she had her Senate Foreign Relations Committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=0.0s)]
*  hearing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=6.54s)]
*  Yesterday. Well, it's not the UN ambassador yet, but she's gonna get confirmed. She's gonna get confirmed. I think I [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=7.72s)]
*  Look, I don't know that any of them are not gonna get confirmed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=14.56s)]
*  It's gonna be fun to watch the Republicans vote for Pete Hegseth who you couldn't have more information about being completely [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=18.86s)]
*  incompetent and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=26.86s)]
*  also being a [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=28.12s)]
*  Serial abuser of women a I think a certainly he's been accused of rape and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=31.36s)]
*  there's a police report and there's a police report and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=40.6s)]
*  there seems to be a [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  just [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=47.56s)]
*  ton of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=48.8s)]
*  accusations of problem drinking [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=51.2s)]
*  Now to be fair [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  He has promised the senators that he's not gonna take any drinks [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=56.12s)]
*  His words, you know, you can always trust it like his wives could oh [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=62.96s)]
*  Absolutely someone who has a problem drinking and is untreated [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=67.56s)]
*  You can always if they promise you they're not gonna drink that's something you can take to the bank [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=73.0s)]
*  And it's not like being [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=78.56s)]
*  Secretary of Defense is probably a stressful job [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=81.68s)]
*  Right or that you would probably want someone a little squeaky or clean who wouldn't be susceptible to blackmail by say like foreign [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=85.0s)]
*  Adversaries, that's the kind of thing conservatives would care about if they had principles [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=92.64s)]
*  But Trump probably likes the blackmail piece so he can control he can control Hegseth more. Oh, that was why I picked him [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=96.48s)]
*  Yep. Anyways, Stefanic [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  Is up in oh and I should just say yes since we got this up [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=105.84s)]
*  We should say that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=110.84s)]
*  During his hearing all the Republicans complained there was these are all anonymous charges and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=113.76s)]
*  Well, it turns out that pegs Hegseth's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=121.92s)]
*  Ex-sister-in-law now has signed an affidavit [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Saying they have a safe word with his second ex-wife [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=130.04s)]
*  To so she could signal whether it went whether she was worried he was going to hurt her or not [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=134.36s)]
*  He was drunk often in his military uniform and that let's be also clear this is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=140.2s)]
*  This reinforces the letter that his mom put her name on the email [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=148.92s)]
*  Sent to him saying that you're abusive of your wife and you're a horrible person [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=155.16s)]
*  I feel bad and I and I see it as a failure. Yeah, and you know, there's a lot of this stuff [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=159.2s)]
*  I also just want to emphasize the stuff about there's some more stuff about Muslims here [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=164.64s)]
*  While drunk in his military uniform violation of military laws Hexas was so inebriated had his brother had to carry him out of a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=170.4s)]
*  Minneapolis strip club Hexeth regular became so drunk he passed out threw up and had to be carried out. Yeah [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=175.96s)]
*  Hexas said that a woman could not vote or that Christians needed to have more children so they could overtake the Muslim population [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=181.76s)]
*  so like that is [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=187.96s)]
*  Like Elon sort of sick. Hey, like these are this is a yeah a constellation of Nazis [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=190.8s)]
*  He also chanted kill all Muslims and I don't know if that was the same night, but that was [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=196.16s)]
*  Partying [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=201.84s)]
*  Anyways, don't you always say genocidal things when you're drunk if it's a good party [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  The liquor's flowing when I get drunk. I start thinking about the birth rates of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=209.64s)]
*  rival populated [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=213.72s)]
*  Come on, man [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=216.6s)]
*  So Hexeth will probably [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=220.16s)]
*  Probably [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=222.84s)]
*  Probably still get confirmed by the Republicans. That's the way they agree about that stuff [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  And so the idea of Elise Stefanik not getting confirmed is almost unimaginable [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  But if you want to get a sense of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=236.32s)]
*  What Trump's diplomatic corps thinks about Israel they have already announced that they're [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  Taking off all the shackles of all weapons transfers [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=247.08s)]
*  I don't actually believe there were any but they want to make it clear that they're getting rid of any that were there [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=250.72s)]
*  his ambassador to Israel [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=258.6s)]
*  Is a guy who refers to Judea and Samaria and says that there is no occupation [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=261.92s)]
*  And here is his ambassador to the UN if you were just wondering it's not going to be a surprise [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=269.96s)]
*  but here she is [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=276.6s)]
*  Surprised by answers in my office, but I did ask you whether you subscribe to the views of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=279.56s)]
*  finance minister Smotrich [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=285.72s)]
*  Trich this is the Israeli finance minister Smotrich and and the former national security [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=288.76s)]
*  minister Ben Gavir who believed that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=294.28s)]
*  First second if you haven't been following and it's more tricks in Ben Gavir are fascists full-on [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=297.44s)]
*  fascists [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=304.08s)]
*  full-on [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=305.48s)]
*  Fascists Stefanik knows who they are. So she of course she does and oh and I will say self-avowed fascist [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  Good [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=316.0s)]
*  Minister Ben Gavir who believed that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=318.04s)]
*  Israel has a biblical right [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  to the entire West Bank and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=323.44s)]
*  In that conversation you told me that yes, you shared that view. Is that your view today? Yes [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=326.36s)]
*  Okay, I think when it comes to this very difficult issue if the president is going to succeed at [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=332.04s)]
*  Bringing peace and stability to the Middle East. We're gonna have to look at the UN Security Council resolutions [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=338.92s)]
*  Not just the ones on Lebanon, which we should enforce but other UN Security Council resolutions [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=346.12s)]
*  It's gonna be very difficult to achieve that if you continue to hold the view that you just expressed [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=352.02000000000004s)]
*  Which is a view that was not held by the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=359.64s)]
*  founders of the state of Israel [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=364.76s)]
*  Who were secular Zionists not religious Zionists? Thank you. Mr. Chairman [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=367.56s)]
*  And just to be clear here, you know, this is [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=372.68s)]
*  This is a preview [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=376.24s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to preside [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=379.08s)]
*  over the US government when Israel declares unilaterally that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=382.28s)]
*  they are permanently annexing the West Bank and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=389.28s)]
*  Donald Trump will in his administration will immediately recognize the validity of that annexation [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=393.76s)]
*  people can [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=402.36s)]
*  argue as to whether this is a [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=404.36s)]
*  You know largely irrelevant and maybe even a clarifying moment because [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=408.92s)]
*  It makes it clear Israel is one state and a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=414.24s)]
*  Full-on apartheid state my argument is it's in the it's an apartheid state as it is right now [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=420.12s)]
*  but [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=428.0s)]
*  This is this is what's going to happen that a minimum and you know yesterday we played a clip of Donald Trump saying like [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=430.04s)]
*  Guys is interesting. There's a lot of like a land there that may [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=436.72s)]
*  Right be but this is telling me this is I mean this is why [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=441.52s)]
*  You know, I'm skeptical about and we already see that that the ceasefire deal [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=446.68s)]
*  is [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=452.4s)]
*  Being broken in terms of violence and in the world [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=454.24s)]
*  There's mass violence in the West Bank right now [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=457.16s)]
*  but also Donald Trump said in that clip that he is not ruling out the ability for like the Israelis to [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=459.36s)]
*  Restart this again, which is what is likely to happen after this phase one [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  Concludes they can do it if they want to and Stefanik is the freak that led those hearings [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=472.8s)]
*  targeting the presidents of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=480.03999999999996s)]
*  universities because their students had the gall to protest a genocide so [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=482.03999999999996s)]
*  This is who he is picked and it is as hawkish and pro-israel as it gets [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic1cGoSXtfs&t=487.96s)]
