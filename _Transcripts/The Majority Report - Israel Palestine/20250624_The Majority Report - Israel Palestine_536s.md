# Van Jones Hits Embarrassing New Low
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8)
*  When the US drops bombs, it is as if like these bombs are attached to like sheets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=0.0s)]
*  And it just rips off the cover of so many people in our society. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=10.0s)]
*  Like in the first Trump administration, I remember going on, I think it was Hayes' show. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=16.0s)]
*  And I was on Hayes' show the night that Trump bombed Syria. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=25.0s)]
*  And it was his first military attack. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=29.0s)]
*  And every guest, even on Hayes' show at that point was like, well, this is something that had to happen. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=35.0s)]
*  And I'm like, wait, what? What? You trust this guy to start bombing places? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=43.0s)]
*  Everybody, that's the way they jump on. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=50.0s)]
*  I think I was the only person on that network between the hours of 8 and midnight who came out against it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=55.0s)]
*  And it is the same with this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=64.0s)]
*  You get to, it is incredibly revealing as to who people are. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=68.0s)]
*  I don't know if people still have questions about Van Jones. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=74.0s)]
*  But if you really need an answer, here it is. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=78.0s)]
*  This is Van Jones two days ago on CNN. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=83.0s)]
*  He's buying himself some time and some room. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=87.0s)]
*  I was also in the Holy Land very recently. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=89.0s)]
*  I think progressives underestimate. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=92.0s)]
*  Pause it for a second. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=95.0s)]
*  He was in the Holy Land very recently? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=96.0s)]
*  Who paid for that trip? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=99.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=100.0s)]
*  Is that just your own miles you used to pay for that trip, Van? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=101.0s)]
*  Are you in the anti-Holy Land right now? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=105.0s)]
*  Like, where are you on the spectrum of being in amongst holiness? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=107.0s)]
*  Are you in the profane world at the moment? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=112.0s)]
*  I mean, how are we talking? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=117.0s)]
*  How is this news analyst talking about geopolitics? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=119.0s)]
*  I was in the Holy Land. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=123.0s)]
*  He's buying himself some time and some room. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=126.0s)]
*  I was also in the Holy Land very recently. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=128.0s)]
*  I think progressives underestimate how dangerous Iran is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=131.0s)]
*  Iran is not a normal country. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=137.0s)]
*  Normal countries don't blind women because they show some hair. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=140.0s)]
*  They don't empower little gangs and proxies to surround a country [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=145.0s)]
*  and fire rockets and rape people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=150.0s)]
*  Pause it for a second. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=153.0s)]
*  Two things are clear. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=154.0s)]
*  Pause it for a second. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=155.0s)]
*  The Iran regime is very oppressive towards women, without a doubt. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=156.0s)]
*  I don't know what the geopolitical implications of that are. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=162.0s)]
*  But should we really be talking about proxies and rape and killing? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=167.0s)]
*  Because I'm old enough to remember death squads. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=175.0s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember death squads that we funded in Central America, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=181.0s)]
*  ones that killed nuns in Central America. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=187.0s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember when Ronald Reagan's administration [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=193.0s)]
*  sold weapons to Iran, this same country, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=199.0s)]
*  they used the money to fund the war on the border with Iran. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=204.0s)]
*  They fund essentially right-wing death squads in Central America. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=210.0s)]
*  But Van is probably a little younger than I am, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=217.0s)]
*  so maybe he doesn't know about this. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=221.0s)]
*  But Iran's completely, they're crazy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=223.0s)]
*  They're so crazy that they were willing to play off to their domestic constituencies. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=228.0s)]
*  If we lob six missiles that do nothing against the United States, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=235.0s)]
*  then it's tit for tat and we're even. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=240.0s)]
*  The restraint that Iran is showing is far more rational [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=243.0s)]
*  than Van Jones going on and thinking he's fooling anybody [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=253.0s)]
*  with his comments about the Holy Land. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=257.0s)]
*  The clip starts, and this was before the strikes, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=259.0s)]
*  the clip starts with him crediting the two-week pause [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=261.0s)]
*  as Trump tried to get his distance and have some time. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=264.0s)]
*  And actually that was just a ruse to surprise Doc. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=266.0s)]
*  Empower little gangs and proxies to surround a country [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=271.0s)]
*  and fire rockets and rape people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=274.0s)]
*  So Iran, the two things are clear. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=277.0s)]
*  The what, they cannot have a bomb, and the why, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=280.0s)]
*  because they say death to America, death to Israel, and death to all the Jews. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=284.0s)]
*  One of those should offend you if you're a progressive. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=289.0s)]
*  At least one should offend you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=291.0s)]
*  And so the question though is the who and the how. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=293.0s)]
*  Is Israel going to take out this nuclear capacity? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=296.0s)]
*  Let me explain to you, if you don't speak English, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=299.0s)]
*  what Van Jones is saying, death to Iran. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=302.0s)]
*  It's not a normal country. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=305.0s)]
*  Is Israel going to take out this nuclear capacity [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=310.0s)]
*  by dropping people there who blow it up, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=314.0s)]
*  or is America going to take it out by dropping a bomb that blows it up? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=317.0s)]
*  One more second. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=320.0s)]
*  You know, this profane country that we live in, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=321.0s)]
*  this non-holy land of America, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=324.0s)]
*  we have intelligence agencies that would dispute the premise [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=327.0s)]
*  of everything that Van Jones is saying. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=331.0s)]
*  They do not have a nuclear weapon capacity. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=333.0s)]
*  They do not have a nuclear weapon program. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=338.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=343.0s)]
*  The bomb that blows it up. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=345.0s)]
*  But the what and the why are clear, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=347.0s)]
*  and I think progressives should get on board with that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=349.0s)]
*  We cannot have a nuclear armed Iran. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=351.0s)]
*  I was in the region, you were in the region. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=354.0s)]
*  This is a very dangerous power that cannot get a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=356.0s)]
*  He's buying himself some time. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=360.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=362.0s)]
*  Van Jones telling you, get on board the drop bomb on Iran tour. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=363.0s)]
*  Incidentally, it turns out by all estimates that the dropping the bombs [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=370.0s)]
*  that they did, did very little. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=375.0s)]
*  Or at least they don't now. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=380.0s)]
*  It's all just, it's just a grotesque, K-Fab. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=385.0s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing is just bizarre. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=392.0s)]
*  I've been rereading Tony Jett's When the Facts Change, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=394.0s)]
*  his essays from 1995 to 2010, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=396.0s)]
*  and there's a bunch on Israel there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=399.0s)]
*  One of the interesting ones is the way that they take to talk about Iran [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=400.0s)]
*  is the same way they used to talk about Egypt before we normalized relations [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=405.0s)]
*  and started recognizing them as a state that we can actually deal with [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=409.0s)]
*  that isn't just bent on anti-Semitic horror. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=412.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=415.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=417.0s)]
*  And I mean, it's, we do this, we just cycle through different countries. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=419.0s)]
*  Hey, for weeks, all we've heard is how Trump's big, beautiful bill will cut Medicaid. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=427.0s)]
*  But almost no one's reporting on a buried provision that would make Trump untouchable. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=432.0s)]
*  Go to ground.news slash majority to see how this bill would block judges [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=437.0s)]
*  from enforcing court orders unless you, the citizen, post a bond first. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=442.0s)]
*  Highly credible sources warn most people can't actually afford to do this, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=447.0s)]
*  and that's pretty obvious. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=452.0s)]
*  So if this bill passes and Trump violates the law, it wouldn't even matter. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=453.0s)]
*  And nobody even knows, which means the GOP's flood the zone strategy is working. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=458.0s)]
*  And it's why I think ground news is the best tool to expose these blind spots before it's too late. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=463.0s)]
*  My partners built the only app and website pulling in news from across the globe, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=469.0s)]
*  then breaking down each source's bias, credibility and the news the right tries to bury. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=474.0s)]
*  And considering most people take the first article they see online as fact, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=480.0s)]
*  their browser extension is essential. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=484.0s)]
*  What it does is it flags the source's bias and links other credible reports to verify the information. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=486.0s)]
*  Ground news is a better version of how we're already staying informed. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=492.0s)]
*  So I got you 40 percent off the same unlimited access vantage plan that I've been using. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=496.0s)]
*  That's just five dollars a month. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=502.0s)]
*  When you go to ground.news slash majority, scan my QR code or redeem the code majority if you're using the app. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=503.0s)]
*  With at least another four years of this, they're counting on you to be distracted. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=511.0s)]
*  This app is how you stay focused. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=516.0s)]
*  You [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhNme6ClO8&t=533.0s)]
