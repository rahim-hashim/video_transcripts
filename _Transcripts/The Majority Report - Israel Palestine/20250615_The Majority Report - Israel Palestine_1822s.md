# How Gaza Exposed The West’s Moral Rot | Chi Ossé | TMR
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4)
*  We are back and we are joined now by Omar Al-Aqad, award-winning journalist and novelist, author of his latest, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=0.0s)]
*  One Day Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This. The title is pretty self-explanatory, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=7.2s)]
*  but Omar, thanks so much for coming on the show. It's my pleasure. Thanks for having me. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=18.32s)]
*  First of all, I can promise you that this would be the first, maybe the first, one of your only media [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=19.92s)]
*  interviews on this book that you won't be asked to condemn Hamas. So I think, you know, you're in good hands here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=26.16s)]
*  I had the statement ready. All right, fine. I guess we'll make do. We'll make do. So you were born in Cairo. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=35.2s)]
*  Your book kind of interweaves your personal story, coming to the West as a teenager, coming to Canada, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=44.0s)]
*  where you've been in both worlds, right? And you had this [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=51.199999999999996s)]
*  shift in your world, but you had the mental clarity being an older kid at that point to kind of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=57.12s)]
*  see some of those differences in coming to the United States, sorry, to Canada. Just tell us a little bit about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=64.24s)]
*  that transition, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=72.0s)]
*  what your conception of Western values were versus how you experienced them when coming to the United States. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=74.88s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's... I mean, Canada. I keep saying United States. I mean, I ended up in the U.S. eventually, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=82.08s)]
*  about 11, 12 years ago. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=89.28s)]
*  So it's a bit of a circuitous route, right? Because I'm born in Egypt. My dad has to get the hell out of Egypt when I'm five years old. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=91.76s)]
*  And so we moved to Qatar, which, you know, pound for pound is the richest place on Earth. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=99.44s)]
*  And if you've never been, it's a very [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  relatively surreal lifestyle. You know, if you're not among the migrant laborer class who are treated like absolute dirt, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  if you're sort of middle class and up, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=115.44s)]
*  it's the easiest life in the world, in large part because you're stepping on the necks of the folks who actually sort of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=117.44s)]
*  built the place. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  But if you're not sort of born into a Qatari family, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=126.24s)]
*  you can't stay in Qatar permanently. You're always in a kind of precarious situation where your visa could be revoked or, you know, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  so on and so forth. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=135.60000000000002s)]
*  And so we had [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=137.28s)]
*  planned on that happening and my dad had decided to start the immigration process to Canada. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=139.36s)]
*  At the time, he couldn't point out Canada on the map. It was just sort of the next destination because once you leave your home, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=144.88s)]
*  that's kind of the life you live. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=152.8s)]
*  You're looking for the next harbor. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=155.84s)]
*  And the way I thought of Canada, specifically the U.S., the West generally, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  was as a kind of harbor. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  To me, it wasn't so much [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=166.56s)]
*  a place as a kind of negation. When you grow up in a place like Qatar, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  everything is censored, for example. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=173.68s)]
*  You know, I have these formative memories of holding up copies of Newsweek to the light [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=176.72s)]
*  to try and see past the black ink that the censor had used [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=180.72000000000003s)]
*  to block off whatever was, you know, deemed too dangerous for me to read. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  And so my first impression of the West [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=189.28s)]
*  was essentially just a negation of that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=192.32s)]
*  I don't care what this place is, but at least I can go there and I don't have to deal with this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=194.8s)]
*  And for the most part, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=201.12s)]
*  that is what it was for me when I first showed up to Canada. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, I go to the library and I can ask for any book I want and I don't have to worry about [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=206.08s)]
*  the possibility of getting deported if it's the wrong thing or, you know, that sort of thing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=210.96s)]
*  And for the majority of my life in this part of the world, that was enough. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=216.4s)]
*  I could deal with everything else. I could deal with the racism. I could deal with the sort of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=220.56s)]
*  petty indignities because I had that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=224.72s)]
*  And I think the book, in large part, is about the moment where [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=228.56s)]
*  that trade-off wasn't something I could do anymore, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=233.28s)]
*  where the price I was paying for that became too high for me to bear. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=236.24s)]
*  And that threshold, was that crossed in the environment after October 7th? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, what was that feeling like for you to kind of see? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=248.96s)]
*  We experienced it covering it on the show. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=256.8s)]
*  The immediate aftermath of the Hamas attack was [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=260.0s)]
*  this whole display of this ramp up of what the genocide was going to look like. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=266.16s)]
*  And I think we all foresaw that it was going to be a genocidal slaughter. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=271.12s)]
*  I don't know if we could have foreseen it being a year and eight months long, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  and us having basically no idea being completely in the dark at this point, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  about how many are dead. I mean, it's in the hundreds of thousands. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=290.08s)]
*  And yet there's still this Western narrative that it's, oh, it's 58 or it's 60,000 people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=293.76s)]
*  The slaughter that we've seen, it was quite obvious. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=301.52s)]
*  The title of your book is a version of a tweet that you put out that went viral. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=307.44s)]
*  It was quite obvious in the weeks following. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=311.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think for me, the way I've been describing it is, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  in terms of this break, at least personally for me, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=320.24s)]
*  I've been describing it the same way that sort of Hemingway's characters went bankrupt, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=325.84s)]
*  little by little and then all at once. I was a journalist for 10 years. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=329.52s)]
*  And there were things that I saw that, if I was a less cowardly person, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=334.88000000000005s)]
*  would have probably brought me to this break much sooner. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=340.56s)]
*  You know, you go to Afghanistan and you see the local soldiers being put on the front lines of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=343.76000000000005s)]
*  every forward operating base such that if the attack comes, they're the ones who die, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  not the NATO soldiers. You see the hierarchy of human life. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=353.68s)]
*  You go to Guantanamo, you see this ad hoc legal system in violation of all normal [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=357.12s)]
*  legal modes designed purely to get these convictions. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=364.48s)]
*  And in every case, I was able to compartmentalize and to say, yes, there's something kind of rotten [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=369.44s)]
*  here, but it's just this moment and it's just this situation. It's unique to this. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=375.04s)]
*  And I think what has happened over the last 20 months is that my ability to compartmentalize [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=380.48s)]
*  has imploded. You know, I keep coming back to the same three factors [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=384.8s)]
*  that make this different for me. And those are sort of intimacy, immediacy, and complicity. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=392.56s)]
*  I wake up every morning and within moments of the horrible thing happening, I see it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=403.84s)]
*  Little kids starving to death, toddlers torn apart by the force of these bombs. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=411.76s)]
*  There's an intimacy and there's an immediacy to it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=418.23999999999995s)]
*  That if I was a perfect human being, probably shouldn't matter, right? What's wrong is wrong, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=421.91999999999996s)]
*  regardless of how immediate or intimate it might be. But it does matter that I see it so closely. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  And then thirdly, there's the complicity, right? My tax dollars are doing this, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  right? I'm killing those kids. That's me. And so it becomes impossible to ignore in the way that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=439.84s)]
*  I so successfully ignored these things previously. That's what's changed for me. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=445.84s)]
*  And it's not like these currents weren't present before. You don't even have to look to Afghanistan [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=451.28s)]
*  or to Guantanamo Bay. You can look to Gaza itself. This place has been an open-air prison [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=457.84s)]
*  for years and years and years, and nobody cared. On October 6th of 2023, a report came out [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=463.44s)]
*  detailing how deadly a year it was for Palestinian children. That's never the starting point of any [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=470.32s)]
*  narrative around this, but it existed. And I was able to ignore it. And that's a function of the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=476.88s)]
*  kind of human being I am. That's a function of the obliviousness that largely carried me through my [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=483.44s)]
*  existence in the West and has largely fallen apart now. Well, I think, you know, it's not [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=489.12s)]
*  moral failing. It's more just what's engendered in us as a part of being in the West. We have an [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=499.84s)]
*  ivory tower kind of view of the other parts of the global South and the Middle East that we exploit. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  But the other part that's so striking in your book is like, it's even in the title, when we're [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=516.24s)]
*  talking about this moral rot of Western liberalism, which I want to get into even more [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=522.4s)]
*  specifically, but just the idea that people can't see historical parallels or feel this immense [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=529.52s)]
*  guilt about being on the wrong side of history. Your analysis of this moment, can you speak a [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=535.92s)]
*  little bit more about the inconsistency of things like, you know, how we speak about the Holocaust [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=543.6s)]
*  and never again. And then the silence of some of those same people as this genocide is not being [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=549.68s)]
*  done. We don't read about it the next day in the newspaper. We see it every day on our phone. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  I think for me, the best I've been able to answer that kind of question [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=566.0s)]
*  has to do with the sort of reward and punishment equilibrium. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=572.2399999999999s)]
*  With respect to something like the suffering of the Palestinian people, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=576.0s)]
*  certainly where I live, I live out on the West Coast. I think this is true of [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  most of the United States, if not the Western world at large. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=586.72s)]
*  There is essentially no consequence to pretending none of this is happening. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=590.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, I wake up every day and I open my computer and I see evidence of the worst things [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=595.68s)]
*  human beings can do to one another. And then I go about my day and it's as though none of this is [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=603.76s)]
*  happening. You know, and there's emails that need to be replied to and there's bills that need to be [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=609.6s)]
*  paid and there's Zoom meetings that need to drag on endlessly and you need to do the stuff. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=614.4s)]
*  And in fact, not only is there no consequence for the vast majority of the people that I'm around [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=621.04s)]
*  at any given moment to thinking about any of this, there's an immense punishment waiting if you do [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=625.68s)]
*  think about this too much and if you do talk about this too much. I mean, I was on tour for [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=631.28s)]
*  this book for two and a half months and at virtually every event, somebody would come up [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=636.4s)]
*  to me afterwards and say, this is the first space where I've been able to sit with this, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=642.16s)]
*  where I've been able to think about this. Because if I talk about this at work, I might get fired. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=648.0s)]
*  If I talk about this with my friends, they might stop being my friends. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=653.52s)]
*  And it's not, you know, they're not there at this event because they love me or they love the book. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=657.3599999999999s)]
*  They don't care about any of that. It's just a place where you can feel like you're not losing [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=661.28s)]
*  your mind. And so I think a lot of this makes perfect sense if you have conditioned yourself [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  to believe that Palestinians are not sufficiently human. And you're good. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=673.28s)]
*  How has that conditioning made itself manifest in the West? I mean, there's a lot of discussion [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=680.0s)]
*  about anti-Semitism in this country. Anti-Jewish hate is a real thing, but a great majority of [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=687.92s)]
*  the instances that are cited are protests against Zionism and the genocide. And I can name dozens of [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=695.8399999999999s)]
*  think pieces that I've seen just in the last month on that very topic. And yet Islamophobia, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=705.04s)]
*  which, you know, even in the word, right, it sounds like you're afraid of spiders. But Islamophobia [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=712.8s)]
*  is the most pernicious and widespread bigotry in our country right now. And it crosses traditional [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=720.56s)]
*  political lines where when we're talking about Western liberalism, there's this kind of hollowness [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=730.0s)]
*  of performing virtue and doing so in basically an explicitly domestic context about groups that have [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=737.52s)]
*  been marginalized historically in this country. But when that looks outward and expands to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=746.56s)]
*  the consequences of capitalism and imperialism, of which the Gaza genocide is both, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=753.1199999999999s)]
*  why is that analysis failing? And why is it in the end so racist in outcome with so many of these [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=761.1999999999999s)]
*  people who would balk at that idea if it was applied to black people, here domestically, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=768.7199999999999s)]
*  Latino people, etc.? I mean, there's a couple of things that come to mind. First and foremost, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=774.0s)]
*  we live in an incredibly anti-Semitic part of the world. The current administration is rife with [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=782.0799999999999s)]
*  raging anti-Semites. I mean, I know that it's sort of been buried under god knows how many scandals [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=787.92s)]
*  and outrages now, but it wasn't that long ago that we were sitting around trying to discern [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=795.04s)]
*  whether one of the central figures in this administration was actually making a Nazi salute [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=799.84s)]
*  or not. I mean, this isn't subtle stuff. I think that is separate from a patently disingenuous [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=804.72s)]
*  effort to conflate criticism of a state that is currently engaged in an act of genocide [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=812.72s)]
*  with anti-Jewish hatred. I think that is a patently bad faith effort, but it doesn't [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=818.32s)]
*  change the fact that we do live in an incredibly anti-Semitic part of the world. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=825.6800000000001s)]
*  I think with respect to Islamophobia, one of the reasons that it has essentially no effect is [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=830.1600000000001s)]
*  because it can have no effect. The consequences of this country or this part of the world [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=837.2800000000001s)]
*  genuinely caring about anti-Muslim or anti-Arab hatred are too immense to ponder, because the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=844.8000000000001s)]
*  second we decide that these human beings, of which I am one, are sufficiently human, such as to warrant [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=852.0s)]
*  actual response to this hatred. We're not just contending with the random stuff that's yelled [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=858.88s)]
*  at me every now and then on the street. We're not just contending with angry comments on Twitter from [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=865.36s)]
*  Freedom Eagle 1776 at Hotmail or whatever, right? We are contending with wholesale slaughter, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=873.1999999999999s)]
*  which is happening right now. How do you go about sort of admitting to yourself [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=880.64s)]
*  that this is the consequence of the thing you've allowed to fester? I think just at a societal [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=888.4s)]
*  level, at a governmental level, once you start thinking of these human beings as being sufficiently [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=894.16s)]
*  human to warrant condemnation, the thing you have to condemn is so overwhelming and so all-encompassing [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=899.36s)]
*  and so all-indicating as to essentially require something much, much bigger than a statement of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=906.0s)]
*  apology or some declaration of regret or something. I think that's part of it. Honestly, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=914.32s)]
*  part of it is proximity to whiteness. I know full well that I get very different reactions depending [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=920.96s)]
*  on whether the first thing someone hears about me is this accent or whether they read my name first. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=929.36s)]
*  Those are two entirely different human beings, primarily because this accent has a proximity [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=934.88s)]
*  to whiteness and this name doesn't. I know I have to live with that. That's the calculus of my [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=940.08s)]
*  existence in this part of the world and that's not going to change overnight. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=944.72s)]
*  This is a good way, I think, to transition to this poll I saw. I'm curious about your take on this, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=952.0s)]
*  Omar. Yesterday, Haaretz, the Israeli paper, wrote about this study that was conducted by [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=957.9200000000001s)]
*  the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. This is done by the university. The Zionists will say, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=969.36s)]
*  oh, Haaretz, so liberals, right? Nope, they're just reposting what the study found, reporting on it, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=978.24s)]
*  and you can't count on other Israeli media to do that. 64% of Israelis see no need for more [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=984.72s)]
*  reporting on Goss and suffering is what the poll found. Now, we should say that this includes [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=990.64s)]
*  Arab Israelis in this total, so in terms of Jewish Israelis, it's higher than 64% who see no need [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=996.88s)]
*  to cover Gaza's suffering anymore. If we could go to the other paragraph, according to the survey [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1004.8000000000001s)]
*  conducted by Dr. Boaz Cherki and Lee Aldar, 64% of Israelis believe that the local media's reporting [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1012.0s)]
*  on Gaza has been balanced and there is no need to present a broader picture regarding the situation [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1019.0400000000001s)]
*  of Gaza's civilians. 89% of the people that support the Netanyahu government have that view. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1025.76s)]
*  But the other question is, if we could scroll down a little bit more here, this is good. 41% [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1031.76s)]
*  of all respondents said that the news on Israel's two mainstream commercial stations, channels 12 [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1039.28s)]
*  and 13, are biased in favor of the population of Gaza. So that is the plurality opinion. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1043.6s)]
*  But I scroll down even more, because that's insane, but there's even more [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1049.52s)]
*  Okay, here we go. Actually, no, down a little bit more. Thank you. Here it is. Another question [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1055.76s)]
*  asked in the Accord poll was, to what extent respondents agreed with the statement that there [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1064.08s)]
*  are no innocent people in Gaza? 64% agreed with it to a large extent, describing their agreement [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1068.16s)]
*  as between four and six on a scale in which one is total disagreement and six is complete agreement. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1075.52s)]
*  So this is the top 50th percentile in terms of strength of response. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1080.56s)]
*  64% agree with the statement there are no innocent people in Gaza. And then the last [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1086.72s)]
*  piece of the poll that I think is important is on the here, this paragraph. When it comes to [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1091.6799999999998s)]
*  Israelis views of foreign media outlets, which for the purposes of the polling referred to CNN and the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1096.8799999999999s)]
*  BBC, 69% of respondents said they were biased in favor of Palestinians in Gaza. Even when asked [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1102.8s)]
*  about Fox News, which is identified with the American right wing, half of those polled, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1111.36s)]
*  and 67% of voters for coalition parties said it was biased in favor of Gazans. I just want [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1117.9199999999998s)]
*  people to sit with that for just a second. 69% of overall Israelis think CNN and BBC's coverage and [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1123.44s)]
*  here in the United States, we're intimately aware with CNN's coverage and Dana Bash and Jake Tapper [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1130.48s)]
*  pushing the pro-Israel narrative over and over and over again. 69% of Israelis think they're biased [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1136.48s)]
*  in favor of Palestinians and half of Israelis think Fox News is biased in favor of Palestinians. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1143.2s)]
*  What do you make of those numbers? What does it say about the West and Israeli society's role in it? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1150.16s)]
*  I mean, honestly, there's something refreshing about it because there isn't this sort of [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1156.56s)]
*  attempt to hide behind a narrative that clearly has no connection with reality. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1169.6799999999998s)]
*  One of the ironic things about that study is that if you were to [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1174.56s)]
*  try to essentially write a news story about that and run it in most of these Western publications [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1179.52s)]
*  that are considered too biased in favor of Palestinians, you either wouldn't get it on the [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1187.04s)]
*  air or you'd get fired for it. It would be considered too inflammatory. And this is true of a lot of [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1192.08s)]
*  stuff that runs in Israeli media and runs plainly without any real controversy that would be [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1196.88s)]
*  considered far too controversial to run in the Western world. I mean, one way to think about this [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1203.68s)]
*  is imagine living in Israeli society right now and not holding those views. How incredibly [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1211.28s)]
*  frustrating an experience that must be. This is essentially a viewpoint that is in line [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1222.24s)]
*  with the reality of what is happening, obviously in the most overt way over the last 20 months, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1232.64s)]
*  but also over the last 70 plus years. The non-existence of the Palestinian people [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1237.92s)]
*  is central to a particular narrative of Israeli life. And again, if that sounds controversial, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1245.6000000000001s)]
*  fine, but it's in line with the reality of the situation. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1252.96s)]
*  It's an ethno-state maintained by violence and domination, and a majority of Israeli society [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1257.52s)]
*  wants the violence and domination to continue to maintain the ethnic purity of the state. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1265.2s)]
*  And I mean, look, if all this stuff makes your viewers or your listeners uncomfortable, fine, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1270.48s)]
*  ignore Israel entirely. Name me one colonial outpost in history that was able to maintain its [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1275.44s)]
*  colonial narrative while simultaneously maintaining a narrative in which the indigenous [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1283.6s)]
*  population that had to be displaced or eradicated was of equal value. Their lives were of equal [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1289.04s)]
*  value. It doesn't exist. It certainly does not exist in the United States. It only exists in [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1295.1999999999998s)]
*  hindsight. It only exists one or 200 years later when the Obama administration can issue this [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1299.52s)]
*  declaration saying, sorry about all the genocide. And my book is titled what is titled for a reason. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1306.8799999999999s)]
*  Because we're going to get around to that place. We're not there yet. And so to me, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1314.24s)]
*  first of all, this isn't the first poll of its kind. This is obviously incredibly heightened [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1320.1599999999999s)]
*  because of the moment we're in, but there's a very long history of these kinds of opinions being in [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1326.8799999999999s)]
*  place. And they sort of have to be. There's no way somebody can imply that a situation in which [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1332.24s)]
*  quite literally millions of Palestinians live in open air prisons, where every movement is subjected [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1341.76s)]
*  to control by the Israeli military, where they have to carry different ID cards and travel down [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1348.0s)]
*  different roads and take different buses. There's no way somebody can imply that that is an equal [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1352.24s)]
*  landscape from which to build peace. That just doesn't exist. And I think honestly, it's sort [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1359.28s)]
*  of refreshing to just see that statement outright instead of hearing some State Department spokesperson [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1365.8400000000001s)]
*  talk to me about the desire for equal peace and equal justice, as all the while my tax money is [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1370.88s)]
*  funding this incredible glaring asymmetry. And this is why it has to come from the outside, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1376.16s)]
*  like it had to do in South Africa and in Rhodesia. And the differences I think in those instances are, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1384.4s)]
*  one, the level of militarization and bombing is not anywhere close, but two, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1393.76s)]
*  white people were definitely demographic minorities. The anxiety too within Israel [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1401.68s)]
*  is the idea that it's more like 50-50 if you were to incorporate Palestinians into [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1408.48s)]
*  official statehood, not just under occupation and control and as [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1418.48s)]
*  third class citizens that they're now slaughtering. So I guess that's a good way I think for us to wrap [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1422.88s)]
*  here. We're in this place right now. The Mamdani campaign in here in New York is very exciting. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1431.44s)]
*  And he went on TV and he talked about when being asked about his views about Israel, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1443.36s)]
*  they said, do you believe as a Jewish state that you support it? He said he supports it as a state [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1449.36s)]
*  of equal rights. And this is, I think, a really important divergence from liberalism, which has [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1455.52s)]
*  been maintaining this two-state solution myth for longer than my lifetime. And it's so untenable [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1463.04s)]
*  at this point, but our politicians on the national level have completely not caught up to it. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1472.16s)]
*  Can you speak about the contradiction of liberalism's support for Israel as an ethnostate, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1477.52s)]
*  especially when you compare it to the multicultural values these same people espouse domestically? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1484.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's something [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1491.84s)]
*  patently exhausting about trying to maintain a sort of liberal approach to this. Because you [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1498.1599999999999s)]
*  essentially have to take every other value that you claim to espouse in every other case [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1504.8799999999999s)]
*  and carve out a little exception for it. You know, segregation is wrong, except in this case where [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1511.12s)]
*  it's good and necessary. Apartheid is wrong, except in this case where it's good and necessary. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1516.8s)]
*  The sort of visceral emotional and psychological reaction you feel when you hear about people [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1522.8s)]
*  being forced to take only certain roads, for example, has to be set aside. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1532.0s)]
*  And over time, that is damaging, right? And I think what you're seeing right now [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1538.8799999999999s)]
*  is, at least for the first time in my lifetime, an actual political consequence to this kind of [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1546.3200000000002s)]
*  incredibly disjointed mode of liberalism, in which you hold on very vocally to a certain set of views [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1554.88s)]
*  and principles, except in one case. If you had told me two years ago that the suffering of the [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1562.24s)]
*  Palestinian people would factor in any way in the results of a US presidential election, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1571.52s)]
*  I would have thought you were out of your mind. And now it can be argued that at least to a certain [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1577.6799999999998s)]
*  extent, this factored in the last presidential election. That means something. There is someone [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1583.6799999999998s)]
*  who, you know, maybe he doesn't win, but has a serious shot at becoming mayor of maybe the [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1590.72s)]
*  most important city in the country, who is finally calling out this glaring hypocrisy. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1596.16s)]
*  Again, if you told me that two years ago, I would have thought you're out of your mind. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1602.48s)]
*  And so what you're watching, I think, is a level of change. But politics, particularly sort of [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1606.24s)]
*  federal politics in this country, is a trailing metric. It takes a very long time to catch up [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1611.44s)]
*  with what the population is thinking, what people are demanding. And so, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1620.08s)]
*  as sort of heartened as I am by just seeing the most basic acknowledgement and the most [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1625.36s)]
*  rudimentary changes, it is depressing in the sense that I think of, you know, how many bodies [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1631.6s)]
*  between this moment and when we reach political calculus that acknowledges it. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1638.6399999999999s)]
*  Something is changing. It's just changing very, very slowly. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1643.36s)]
*  And the Israelis are counting on that. It's why they're killing every journalist that they can [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1647.2s)]
*  find. It's the deadliest conflict. I hate calling it that, but that's the metrics [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1651.76s)]
*  used for journalists in history. And they've killed all the record keepers. They've killed them. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1656.8000000000002s)]
*  And so they want to use this period of darkness, both journalistically and in terms of [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1663.44s)]
*  Gaza's capacity to count the dead and their hospital capacity to kill as many as they can [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1671.28s)]
*  in this period of time where they're doing it in somewhat secret. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1677.52s)]
*  I mean, look, the moment a US presidential administration makes the phone call and lets [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1683.4399999999998s)]
*  it be known that there's actual consequences to any of this and that it needs to stop, it will stop. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1689.04s)]
*  I mean, fundamentally, this has happened in the past. This happened under Reagan very famously. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1696.64s)]
*  None of this happens without my tax money. None of it. And the second a solution is imposed [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1705.12s)]
*  by the United States, and I use the word imposed very deliberately here, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1712.16s)]
*  it will come to fruition. But we have had administration after administration, year after [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1716.64s)]
*  year, decade after decade of some White House or State Department spokesperson coming up to the [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1723.12s)]
*  podium and saying, we're so flustered and frustrated. We don't know what to do. They won't listen to us. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1728.9599999999998s)]
*  It's patently nonsense. And everybody knows it's nonsense. Everybody knows that the second that [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1736.2399999999998s)]
*  there are actual consequences and there's actual pressure to not engage in what is effectively [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1742.9599999999998s)]
*  wholesale slaughter, that will all come to an end. It's just a matter of waiting on whether [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1748.8s)]
*  there's enough domestic political pressure such that enough politicians make the calculation [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1753.9199999999998s)]
*  that it is in their favor or in their personal interest to consider Palestinians human. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1760.56s)]
*  We're effectively waiting on that date. Every other argument is an attempt to employ a level [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1766.32s)]
*  of pragmatism and political calculus onto something that, at least to my mind, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1773.84s)]
*  is as clear a moral issue as has existed in my lifetime. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1781.1999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. Well, everybody should read. One day everyone will have always been against this. It's [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1785.9199999999998s)]
*  a beautiful book. Omar, thanks so much for your time today. We'll put a link to your book below [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8L7Ph3wn4&t=1791.9199999999998s)]
